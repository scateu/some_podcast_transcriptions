Support comes from our 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,624
You were basically introducing is really low fares were these Airlines trying to match your prices

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,744
Yes in some cases they were and we told the Republic of Texas that

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
You could fly at the lower fare but if you paid the higher Fair we would give you a free bottle of whiskey

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
And so for a couple months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,408
From NPR how I built this

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,736

I'm guy Roz and Ali show how an eccentric Texas lawyer

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
A crazy idea in the Southwest Airlines now one of the biggest airlines in the world

16
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
Could you could you to start by introducing yourself Mitchell killer

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
Make it herb if you would herbplease

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,224
Can you just say your full name

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
This is Herb

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Kelleher

21
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
And your best known as the

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Founder of Southwest Airlines

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
How how old are you

24
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
85

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
Okay great

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
We are very excited to talk to you about

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,632
Going to jump in here for like two I mention that before we really started our interview

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,496
I can get some time to just chat with her and I learned some interesting things about him like

29
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
What do you eat for breakfast

30
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
Normally for breakfast I have cheese crackers

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
And he likes to drink

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Wild Turkey Bourbon

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
And that he's been a smoker for

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
Pretty much his entire life

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
I just enjoyed the magical

36
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
Mystical Aroma On Site

37
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Osmo

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
So how soon after you wake up do you have a

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Well it's

40
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
That was a quick okay with your cheese crackers

41
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,520
Didn't before my cheese crackers story of how herb launched

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
Southwest Airlines 50 years 1966 to be exact

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Herb was a young lawyer

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
He's living in San Antonio Texas

45
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,088
He had started his own Law Firm helping clients to start company

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,184
And one day one of her clients got and Rollin King

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Cosmo

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Pacific Southwest

49
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
And it flies only in California

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
And I have an idea it looks

51
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Let's meet for a drink

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
And Rollin

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Came to me with the idea of setting up a similar operation in Texas

54
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,104
And and how soon after he sort of floated this idea

55
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
To you saying yep

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
Let's do it let's start a company

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,784
It was a very short period of time maybe you know

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Like a minute

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
No it was longer than that I was just joking

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
But was that a very short days

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Case within days

62
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Within days

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
What first I was very skeptical

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
But then I did some research and discovered that PSA was very successful in California

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
The Texas

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
Supplied all the requisites for an intrastate Airline

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
Because it was a big state that had large metropolitan areas

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
Far enough apart to justify flying

69
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,064
And so well Houston Dallas and San Antonio weather

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Obvious first Target

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Because they were the

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Three largest cities in Texas

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
What did you

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Know about Airlines

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,888
Well I knew nothing about Airlines which I think made me eminently qualified to start one

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
That because

77
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
What we tried to do at Southwest bus

78
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,800
Get away from the traditional way that Airlines had done business

79
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
So I started with the tabula rasa blank

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Slate

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
And I think that was very helpful

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
So at this point in the how old are you by the way at that point in your life

83
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
I was 35 35 okay

84
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
So you have in your family or just right for children

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,000
Four children and you got the successful Law Firm by life was eat with your history

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Profitable at that time

87
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
No it was not notably

88
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Profitable

89
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
As a matter of fact

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
Warren Buffett reportedly joked about it at one time

91
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
NSAID

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
If a capitalist had shot down the Wright brothers

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
At Kitty Hawk in 1903

94
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
The economy would probably be better off

95
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
And so it didn't have very great

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Returns

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
It was constantly

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111
Difficulty why did you

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
You can think that this was a plausible

100
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Idea

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
I think it was for your lure

102
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
Of doing something

103
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Different

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
Doing something that was exciting

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
I really always have

106
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Had a great deal of curiosity

107
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
And then I thought to myself well you know

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Mostly adults

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
The United States of America

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Haven't been able to fly because of the cost barrier

111
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Is too expensive

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
It's too expensive for you they just thought it was business people on

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Expense account

114
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
And so what I'm saying is that

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
In terms of

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Market analysis

117
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
There was a huge

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Untapped market for flying out there okcu

119
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
You decide with Rollin to start a company was that right Incorporated

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
67

121
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
But of course I was just a piece of paper

122
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
And we start to receive money

123
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
To the extent of about $500,000

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
That's a bit was quite a lot of money to raise I guess

125
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Is it that time it certainly was

126
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Listen.

127
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
We were set to go

128
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,303
I am Warrior Competition like at the time of their other airlines

129
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,655
That we're doing these Texas life-like flight between Houston and Dallas and end each other places

130
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,263
Oh yeah they proved to be our biggest adversaries because they were not exactly

131
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Warm

132
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
Welcoming and hospitable

133
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,943
Yeah we didn't get kisses on both cheeks when we announced that we intended to

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,783
Create an intrastate carrier soberanes continental and transtex

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Slater text

136
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
International

137
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Really took out after us

138
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
And I get this involved in

139
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Political fights and fights

140
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
The courts and they just thought that they would

141
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Apply their incumbency

142
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
And their financial strength

143
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
To bleed Southwest Airlines

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
The dance before I could ever fly

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
They were

146
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Suing Southwest Airlines

147
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,943
Correct why were they saying you shouldn't operate

148
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Well joke

149
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
The arguments that they made in

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
In court or actually all kind of

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Specious

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
And this is

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
One illustration of where

154
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
People attempt to use

155
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
To manipulate the government

156
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
To prevent competition

157
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
That's what they were up

158
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
So how long does it take you to fight these

159
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
These legal challenges

160
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
Well between the time when I start working

161
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,799
On forming Southwest and the time we flew our first flight

162
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
It was four and a half years

163
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Wow it took a little pertinacity

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Yeah

165
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
During that time the company ran out of money

166
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
And a 19-6

167
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
T9 the board of director

168
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Had a meeting and talked about shutting

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
They are lying down

170
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Shutting a company down

171
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
And I said well how about

172
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
If

173
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,631
I lugait for nothing and pay all the court costs out of my own pocket

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,727
Would you be willing to continue under those circumstances and they said

175
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
Osher

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
What was it motivated you to fight

177
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
For 4 years

178
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
To lunch this Airline

179
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
But first of all I was idealistic

180
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Because I figured if they can prevent Southwest Airline

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
From introducing

182
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
What Southwest Airlines proposes

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
To provide physical

184
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Consumer

185
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Then that is

186
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Assign

187
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
That the free enterprise system is failing

188
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
And one of the things that motivated me was to

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Is that

190
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Validate

191
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
The free enterprise system

192
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
And another one was of course

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
It was very hot competition and

194
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
I like to win

195
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
But what's up

196
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,135
Like what I don't get is it was such a huge gamble anyway because you you could have spent those four and a half years

197
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Fighting

198
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
And then winning

199
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
And then Southwest Airlines might have fizzled out anyway

200
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
I'll tell you what guy you put your finger on something

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Because

202
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
If you had taken a poll in the state of Texas

203
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
The statue of Father application

204
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
I can show you

205
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
The 99

206
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
What 9%

207
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Of the population of

208
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
State of Texas to take this single never come to anything

209
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
I'm very serious about that several people told me that they said

210
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
They were glad to see

211
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
How how much the flight energize met in that I was enjoying it

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
But herb don't get yourself it'll never make a dime

213
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
Did you ever get sad or depressed me how did you keep your spirits up

214
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,911
Wild Turkey Hill.

215
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Haggai it may provide a little boost

216
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
But frankly my spirits

217
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Just don't get down

218
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
I don't stress very easily

219
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
I'll give you an example.

220
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
They have stress glasses

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
Southwest Airlines years ago many years ago

222
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
And up

223
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
They invited me to come over and speak

224
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
You know the fella that was running the classes

225
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
He said to the class you said we know

226
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Herb undergoes

227
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
A lot of stress all the time

228
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Hotel the class how do you handle it and I said

229
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
I don't have that I liked it

230
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
That was the last time I was asked back to the collapse

231
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
So

232
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,359
So you I mean what you were going in and out of courtroom

233
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
For 4 years

234
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
How are you making a living at that

235
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Well I'm still practicing law

236
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,343
I mean I was doing a lot of other things during that time which led to very long week

237
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,231
Walmart occasion I was in the law office for two full days

238
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
And at the end of those two full days I've went home shaved and 1/2 a fundraising dinner for Southwest Air

239
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
But that's kind of the

240
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
The perseverance

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
That it's Amanda

242
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
To help get Southwest Airline started while still practicing law

243
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
I'm doing many other things

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
So what happened to the court

245
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
What's up with the Southwest

246
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
It was

247
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Through the United States

248
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Supreme Court

249
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
And through the text

250
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Supreme Court twice

251
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Before we could fly

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
And the Texas Supreme Court handed down

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
An order

254
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
19 hours prior to our first flight

255
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
When was that

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Well that was a 19th June of 1971

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
We start flying on June 18th 1971 what was the flight where they go

258
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
The first flight

259
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Went from Dallas to San Antonio

260
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
But the one that received all the publicity went from Dallas

261
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Houston

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
We were the underdog

263
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
Okay what sort of David vs the Goliath

264
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
Seattle not just one but three of them

265
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
So there was a lot of news coverage about it and that's the reason people pay a lot of attention

266
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
2 is finally getting underway

267
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Were you on that first flight by the way

268
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,519
No I was I was busy working to make sure there was a second flight

269
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Do you remember that day that the first like to Goffin

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
Remember why you feel that you feel like finally this is done

271
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
Oh it was wonderful. I'll tell you the experience I had

272
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
When the first airplane came in

273
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,183
It was over a in Fort Worth American Tanger

274
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
So I went over there and there's this

275
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
After four and a half years

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
I'm stuck my head

277
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
In the back of one of the engine

278
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
And mechanic gravity

279
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,567
Hold me back and you said you realize that thrust reverser goes off

280
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
It will decapitate you

281
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
And I said at this moment I don't give a damn

282
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
So at this point Southwest Airlines and what it starts advertising it starts

283
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,791
Flying many Ripple with it was a flying more than one route was it flying multiple routes

284
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
Well it was Dallas Houston Houston San Antonio and San Antonio Dallas

285
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,055
Do one of those legs well on some flights we had the fares as low as $10

286
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
Those we had theirs as low as 15 or $20

287
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
We were about

288
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
45% lower

289
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Then the other carriers

290
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
So how are you able to do that how are you able to charge

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
So much

292
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Such a lower fare than the other

293
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
At through enormous productivity

294
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
But but how I mean I'm assuming you said a few planes

295
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Will we start out with three

296
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
And then we got a fourth

297
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,543
We had to get rid of one airplane in order to meet our payroll

298
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,127
Right after Southwest start flying and so

299
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
We decided

300
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,759
That we would fly a for airplane schedule with three airplane

301
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Ten-minute turns at the gate

302
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
We bring that airplane in

303
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
+ 10 minutes after

304
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Stopped at the gate

305
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Ditto

306
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
It would be pushing back again

307
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
And we had airplanes that unibrow operating

308
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,935
12 hours a day sometimes so each one of those additional flights

309
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,311
Representative Revenue generation opportunity that the other characters didn't have

310
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Okay but even so I mean

311
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Those other carriers

312
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Like braniff and Texas International right

313
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
They were charging

314
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,111
Much much higher fares and it couldn't just been that you turn to plans around faster

315
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
Knows the whole country thing you're right about that

316
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
I was just giving you an example

317
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
Out with the ten-minute turn because it's a vivid one

318
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Addition to that

319
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,679
They were by definition a monopolist

320
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,823
They had been under 40 Years of federal government supervision through the c a b

321
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
That the Civil Aeronautics board yes right

322
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
And during that time

323
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
If they had a little thing Angel problem

324
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
Of the cab with just give them a fair increase

325
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
I hope so

326
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
That's how their fares got so high

327
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
As compared to what we were doing

328
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Since we were regulated by the

329
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Ucab

330
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
Okay so you weren't regulated in the same way but

331
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
Are you doing other things like

332
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Lake peigneur employees less

333
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,031
Well it dependent initially we were paying them less

334
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,383
As the years went on we were paying them or their total compensation

335
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
I was superior to the other carriers and in addition

336
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,807
When we turned our first very slim profit in 1973

337
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
We set up the first

338
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Profit sharing plan

339
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
In the American airline industry

340
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,815
And I think we made a profit of I don't know a hundred thousand dollars that year or something like that

341
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
But that would alter course to pour billions

342
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Enter employees pockets

343
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
And your employees were

344
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Were you nice as well

345
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,615
Yeah we were the most heavily unionized carrier in the United States

346
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,199
Arlo cost were not due to being a non-union carrier

347
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Since we were

348
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,807
More unionized than our competitors were

349
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,647
So you were basically introducing these really low fares

350
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Woody's Airlines trying to match your prices

351
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Yes in some cases they were

352
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
There's no question

353
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
What about those mattafact braniff at one point

354
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Put in a lower fare

355
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
The Narrows

356
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
What's it called an introductory Thayer cuz they've been serving Texas you know for 40 years by that time but it any of

357
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
One of the things that came out of that was

358
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
We maintained our full fares

359
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
And we told the Republic of Texas

360
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
If you paid the higher fare

361
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
We would give you a free bottle of whiskey

362
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
And so for a couple of months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Flying at that time with

364
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Give like a madman and you know

365
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Tumblers with

366
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Stop action

367
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Glamorous experience with Southwest was competing on

368
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Christman you will not

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
You were not doing in fly cocktails

370
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Like what do people think of your service forces

371
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Competition

372
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
God I got a story to tell you on that

373
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,463
It was Thanksgiving of 1971 remember we've been in business since June

374
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Yep

375
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
And my sister-in-law

376
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
The life of lady called me

377
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Myra law office

378
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
And she said her about

379
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
She said I just flew from Houston to San Antonio on Southwest Airlines

380
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
I've traveled most of the world's Airlines which was true

381
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
You know she was a world Traveler

382
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
And she said I know you're going to be a big success

383
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
You got the best in-flight service

384
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
That I have ever experienced on any Airline

385
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
And I said

386
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
Am I glad to hear that how many passengers were on the airplane

387
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,095
She said just me

388
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
In just a minute

389
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Southwest goes National and Herb convinces Travelers that Airlines do not have to serve in-flight meal

415
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
It's how I built this from NPR

416
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
And I Rise

417
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,151
1970s Southwest Airlines only fly within the state of Texas

418
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
In 1978

419
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,759
Something really important happen

420
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Congress decides to completely deregulate the airline industry

421
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
And for Southwest Airlines

422
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
That means

423
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
They can now start flying to new cities

424
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Outside of Texas

425
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
At this point you Southwest is expanding and your competitors are no longer just taxes are lies your computer

426
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
He was like American and

427
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
And an N Pan Am and TWA right National major International carriers

428
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,503
Were people skeptical that Southwest would be able to compete in

429
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Oh yes

430
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
We were described as

431
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
The Texas Airline that could only be

432
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Successful in

433
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
The state of Texas

434
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Okay

435
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
And then we were described as a

436
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Sunbelt Airline

437
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
They could not be successful outside

438
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
The Sunbelt

439
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
There was a

440
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Press conference for winning the Baltimore

441
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Where was the reporters there said that

442
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,943
Waiting on mr. Larry said I know you've been very successful out west but

443
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Now you're coming to the east

444
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
The most competitive

445
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,855
Part of the country as far as Airline Services concerned

446
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
And I said yeah

447
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
It's so competitive that when we start out here

448
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,047
We're reducing your existing fares by 60%

449
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
How competitive does that sound at that time

450
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
Were you guys already serve No Frills

451
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
What we were no frills we're in the sense that we were short all

452
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
And I got a restriction

453
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,895
What you can do you have relatively short flight till like peanuts

454
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
Two drinks

455
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
That sort of thing but you know

456
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
When we start flying long-haul lights

457
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
From San Antonio to Los Angeles

458
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Where to press conference

459
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
You know to announce a new service

460
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
And

461
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
One of the

462
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Reporters there said

463
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
What are you going to serve

464
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
Meals on those flights and I said no we're not

465
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
We're going to charge you $400 less

466
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Bertram

467
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Right

468
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,871
And I understand you can get a pretty good sandwich at Jason's for $400

469
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
So when I would Point did you give up your life right

470
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,575
Actually that was at the request the board of directors in 1981

471
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,672
Can you were still you still had your own law practice that you were doing other work for

472
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Throughout the entire 1970s

473
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Oh yes yeah

474
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,584
And I'll tell you the truth you know I didn't really hang her

475
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Doobie Park corporate life

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Because

477
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Lawyers have a lot more freedom to do their own thing when and where they want to

478
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,640
But we hired a very excellent fellow named Lamar Muse who was a real battler

479
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
To get the company off the ground in operation

480
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
He had substantial Airline experience

481
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
Bad. He did a wonderful job

482
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
And so you don't find me a 1981 we lost

483
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Successor to Lamar

484
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:57,376
And the board director said to me you've got to do it and it did you want to do it I felt I had to do it

485
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,192
And I'll tell you why because the start of the 1980

486
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
You had unemployment of 10.8%

487
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
You had a double-dip recession

488
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,664
You had the air traffic controllers strike

489
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Then Lamar Muse

490
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
The guy we had to get the cut me off the ground he launched a competitor against just gold Muse hair

491
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
You left Southwest and then lodged a competitor

492
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
Yep that's 3 years after he left gold Muse are you feel like that well I thought it was somewhat in modest on his paw

493
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
But because he called muser after himself but where you at

494
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,592
What are you doing we work together all these years and now you're done

495
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,176
We bought them later you buy some later

496
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
When they're on the verge of bankruptcy

497
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
We bought news there

498
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
But it was there

499
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
In 1981

500
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,928
So I figured I'd better do what the board asked me to do

501
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
And come to Southwest Airlines

502
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Full-time

503
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Was making money at the time

504
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Yes

505
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
We've been profitable every single year

506
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
For 43 years I guess now

507
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,336
You must be the other airlines crazy because they were

508
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
A lot of them

509
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Have had good years and bad ear

510
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,200
But it seems like Southwest is just

511
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Has never had a

512
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Bad here

513
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
What we've had years when

514
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
You know earnings were down

515
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,184
But we've never had a loss for a full year since 1900

516
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
B2

517
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
And we've never throw those an employee at Southwest Airlines when the rest of the industry during that. Up until

518
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Has probably furloughed I don't know

519
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
A million-and-a-half employees

520
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Throughout the world

521
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Basically

522
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
We

523
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
Look at history and said this is a very dicey business

524
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Serbia

525
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Delta Airline business

526
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Yeah

527
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,064
So we may be flamboyant from the marketing standpoint but we're going to be very conservative from the Fisk

528
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Google stand for

529
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
And

530
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Established

531
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
A rule of thumb

532
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,280
That we're going to pay 80% of the cost

533
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
List of all brand new airplanes from internally generated funds

534
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,680
And actually wound up paying 100%

535
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
For most of our airplanes so we had

536
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
The largest

537
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
Percentage in our Fleet of owned airplane

538
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Of any carrier of any size

539
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
So so

540
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
What does that mean

541
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Well I mean

542
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
You're not taking on that

543
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Right when you do that

544
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,112
So when you get in the bad times you're not threatened by the deck payments

545
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,000
Which is put cameras into bankruptcy and out of bankruptcy and back into bankruptcy you know for

546
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
35 years

547
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,144
You heard from from the outside from listen to stories

548
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
The airline industry

549
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Seems so

550
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,312
Brutalight is it do you think it's more Savage than other Industries

551
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
I think

552
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
That it's more competitive than other engine

553
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Mysteries

554
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
And one of the reasons for that is

555
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
That our principal Capital asset

556
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
The airplanes

557
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
Moovit 540 miles an hour

558
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Yeah

559
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
And you know if you have a shoe factory

560
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
The fails in Seattle as an example

561
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
You can't

562
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
Within hours transport that chew Factory 2

563
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
Chattanooga Tennessee to compete there

564
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
But if

565
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,592
Your Seattle Air Service fails you can have your airplanes

566
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
In San Antonio or Chattanooga

567
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Within a matter of hours so

568
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
The very mobility of your Capital assets

569
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Breeds a lot of competition

570
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,184
Did you like that competition. Did you like being an airline CEO now

571
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
Imagine all that stuff

572
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
Was it fun for you

573
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,792
Well I have to adapt myself

574
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah I love being with the people at Southwest Airlines

575
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
That was like a fountain of youth

576
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
For me

577
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
They were so wonderful and entertaining and

578
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Ghetto

579
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Great to be with

580
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
That part of it but

581
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
When your pricing lawyer pretty much

582
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Do Your Own Thing

583
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
And

584
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
It's a swift Pace wealth

585
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
Things to move as swiftly at first

586
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,904
What I came to Southwest Airlines full-time and

587
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
We're moving swiftly compared to the rest of the

588
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Airline industry

589
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
But not compared to my experience

590
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,168
Were you pushing for expansion and growth and all those things

591
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
During your tenure

592
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Oh yes I mean Southwest Airlines

593
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Expanded enormously

594
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
You know from a very small base

595
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
But I soon realized

596
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
It was a speech

597
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
That I want to hear

598
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,296
We're of a guru said if you can improve a corporation five four

599
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
Percent in a year that's a mirror

600
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,232
Oh okay I was trying to do 25%

601
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Maybe that's why I feel a little frustrated

602
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,632
So it really brought my thinking you know more in line

603
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
Even if it might have seemed like it

604
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Play slow process for you

605
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
The fact that Southwest was growing and

606
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,920
That prevailed in this industry is is pretty remarkable is pretty unbelievable

607
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:04,576
Given that you know so many of those early competitors don't even exist anymore and some of the great iconic Airlines

608
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
TWA Pan Am

609
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Exactly many of them

610
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
There are very few left

611
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,792
What mistakes did they make that you seen that you have made

612
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Well

613
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
We just did things

614
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Differently

615
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Black Market

616
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Bashar

617
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Who is Shiva

618
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Supposed

619
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
I told anybody say

620
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Mansion Market

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Chair I punch him in the nose

622
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,528
Because here all these big companies fighting over their market share and losing money and following employee yeah

623
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Let's focus on profitability

624
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:43,744
And if we have 4% of the market were profitable that's better than having 90% of the market

625
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
And being unprofitable

626
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
What's the value of Southwest

627
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
Overall

628
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Oh

629
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Probably

630
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
20 billion dollar something like that

631
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
One of the biggest

632
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Airlines in the United

633
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
At in the world

634
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
In terms of passengers

635
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Sunbelievable

636
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Yeah

637
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
It really is

638
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
It's like I've had too much Wild Turkey

639
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Fantasizing

640
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Weather when you start of the company

641
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
How much how much did you invest

642
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Personally

643
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
I invested $10,000

644
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Which must be worth

645
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Quite a bit today

646
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Imagine if well it's going up some

647
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Since then

648
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
But

649
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
That's a company

650
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
That's what I thought was

651
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Requirement

652
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Of good leadership

653
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
I was turned down pay increases

654
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Bonus increase

655
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
To set a good example

656
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
I thought for all of our people

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Corsa stock that I got

658
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,696
Rose enormously in value but that was in lieu of cash compensation

659
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
SeaWorld

660
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Mainly paid with Woodstock

661
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,376
Yeah basically was stock at like at the biggest kick out just to give an Exemplar

662
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
When I did a stock option deal

663
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,008
In lieu of pay raises was a pilot so they could Southwest Airlines

664
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Stock options

665
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
In lieu of a pay increase

666
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
I took no pay increase

667
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Along with them

668
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm not trying to single anybody out but

669
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
There was a

670
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
The head of an airline that was smaller than Southwest Airlines and on the verge

671
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Going out of business

672
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,536
Do salary and bonus for three times what mine were at Southwest Airlines and that's the way I wanted it

673
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
Are you from worried that somebody know some young you know

674
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
Herb Keller type

675
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,032
Characters going to come around and put up some upstart Airline and knock Southwest office

676
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Chris Brown

677
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
I'm concerned about it all the time

678
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
I got a letter to her employees

679
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
And

680
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,808
It was about my 10 for most concerns for the next decade of Southwest Airlines okay yeah

681
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
And

682
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Number one

683
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Was us

684
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
That we ignore competition

685
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
That we get complaints

686
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
That way

687
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Get cocky

688
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
And I used to line think small and ask volume will get bigger

689
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,704
Think they can act big and will get smaller

690
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
So could happen one day

691
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
So it's possible

692
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
You know,

693
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
History buff

694
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,408
And if you look at the largest companies

695
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
And United States

696
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
As the 19th century turned into the 20th

697
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
Most of them are gone

698
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
The central leather company

699
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
+ 1900 + 1901

700
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Was the 17th largest

701
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
This company in the United States

702
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
But it didn't anticipate

703
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
What the Advent of the Ford automobile

704
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Was going to me

705
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
You know what it did

706
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
It made buggy whips and saddle

707
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
And never stop doing it until it was gone

708
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
And if you look at countries

709
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Boys look at companies

710
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
They perish

711
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
If you have any sense of History

712
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,136
You realize that and you don't try to avoid it

713
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,256
And hearing the story of how you made this happen and all the work you put into it

714
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
I wonder if you think your

715
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Chicken wire differ

716
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
To be able to

717
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Put up with all that stuff for so many years

718
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,984
Well I said I probably am wired a little bit

719
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:11,104
Currently some for many people and they're probably very happy about that difference themselves

720
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
One of the things is that

721
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
I never look back

722
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
You know I don't spend a lot of time regretting things

723
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
It went wrong

724
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
And furthermore

725
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
I think

726
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
I've always had a great deal of fun

727
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Out of what I was doing

728
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
And you know

729
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,096
People would say to me why don't you why don't you burned-out yeah

730
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
You know I was working 200 hours a week

731
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,704
Loveland server simplywell

732
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
It's easy

733
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,848
When you have a passionate joy and what you're doing you don't burn out

734
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,760
Herb Kelleher co-founded Southwest Airlines 50 years ago

735
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
And he served as CEO and then I'm bored

736
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
Before retiring in 2008

737
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,792
