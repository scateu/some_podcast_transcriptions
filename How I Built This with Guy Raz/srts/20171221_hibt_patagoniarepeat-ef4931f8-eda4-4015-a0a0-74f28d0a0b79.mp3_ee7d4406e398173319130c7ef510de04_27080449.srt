From The Archives

26

Enjoy

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
My favorite quotes is if you want to understand the entrepreneur study the juvenile delinquent

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Cuz it's cuz they're saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way and that's what they all say they just say this

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Do it this other way and that's the fun part of business actually

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
Breaking the rules

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
From NPR how I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the story

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Behind the movement

33
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Hot metal in a converted chicken coop

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,296
Outdoor clothing brand Patagonia today he says he does not want you

35
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Your money

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,840
If it isn't that kind of entrepreneur who's going to wow you with a PowerPoint presentation or a

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Snappy elevator pitch

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
He's basically a surfer

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Kayaker in a mountain climber who sort of stumbled into the role of business

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
So pretty

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
How can I say this

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Eccentric

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
But in the best possible way

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
If I never had any interest

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
Becoming Richie's

46
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,136
Actively work to slow down patagonia's growth in profit margins and yet

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Despite his best efforts to keep it small

48
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,024
This little clothing company he started 50 years ago

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Has turned into a

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Huge business

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
Well I never intended this

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
It's just

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,752
I just have this Knack that everytime I look at

54
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
A product

55
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Look at it nice

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
You know I can make

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
It could be better

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
So every time we went climbing

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,784
Would come back with ideas on how to improve the climbing gear which is very crude enough

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
And so

61
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
You know I became a blacksmith

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
Pressa I've taught myself blacksmithing so that I could make

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Some of the

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,584
Climbing Hardware that I thought would be better than what's available you literally like pounding

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Hot pictures of metal into shape

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
That's exactly right

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
You don't do it my

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,752
Parents backyard then my father

69
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Help me convert a chicken coop into it

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Hello shop

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Well as making Dino pitons

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,832
Metal spikes that you pound in the cracks and I was making the carabiners of snap blankson

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Target

74
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
Yeah cuz I mean at that time mountain climbing was still

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Huge commercial

76
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Enterprise

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
No they were probably

78
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
250 climbers in the country why how

79
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Yeah

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
And all the gear came from Europe in and it was pretty poor quality

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
Like the pitons were made to be used once

82
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
Because Europeans looks at

83
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Climbing

84
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Conquering mountains

85
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,480
And you just leave all the gear in place to make it easier for the next group

86
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
And we were brought up

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Another philosophy of John Muir and

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
And also throwing

89
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
We felt like nature

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Should be left alone and you should

91
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Do a climate but leave nothing behind

92
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,863
And so I made pitons out of better materials at

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Put in and take it out

94
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
And used over and over again

95
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,031
It was a lessening in quality I think because

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
Do European pitons for selling for

97
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
$0.15

98
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
A piece

99
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
In mind word dollar and a half

100
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
And I guess you did this for like

101
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
10 or 10 or so years

102
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Yeah

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Were you doing well

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
Well yeah we had 80% of the market

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,951
And anyway I guess you had no intention of ever making it that right

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
No not at all right I didn't respect businessman I had no idea

107
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Business whatsoever I was a Craftsman

108
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Yeah but you know we were making

109
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Are they any money

110
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
We're making about 1%

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Prophet the end of the year we're basically paying art

112
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
By the hour so how did you guys Branch out from

113
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
From climbing gear to clothing

114
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
Well I was on a climbing trip to Scotland in the winter

115
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
Walking by some shop and I saw a rugby shirt in the window and I saw

116
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Pretty cool

117
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
You know it's real colorful head blue and red and yellow

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,071
Made really tough so I thought this make a really great shirt for

119
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Climbing

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
You know the caller

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Can I keep the gear slings from cutting into your napkin

122
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
You know at that time

123
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Active Sportswear for men was basically Gray

124
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Sweatshirts and sweat

125
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
That was it proven men did not worry

126
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
And so I started wearing this climbing and everybody was going wow

127
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Where'd you get that

128
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,927
So it's kind of Lights came on I said well maybe I'll to import a few of these from England

129
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
And see if she'll sell and sure enough they sold

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
And then I started making some climbing shorts

131
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Pantsing

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
One thing led to another and I realize

133
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Islam more profitable than making

134
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Pitons

135
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
How did you come up with the name Patagonia

136
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Guilin 68

137
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Height I did a

138
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
6 month long trip from California down to

139
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
South America

140
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
We drove and surfed all the way down

141
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Tacos

142
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Download Lena and then sold a surfboards and then climb volcanoes down in southern Chile and skeet off of them and

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
I kind of fell in love with that area

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
Patagonia

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
You know on those days nobody even knew what Patagonia

146
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Kauai

147
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Timbuk2

148
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
You know how many people know where Timbuktu is

149
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
And so I decided to call it Patagonia because

150
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
I wanted to make clothing for those kind of conditions UK

151
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Warren

152
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
Like super high winds cold

153
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
Crazy temperature change in weather

154
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Is it is it like

155
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
You did not know anything about

156
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Clothing

157
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
Cheer right I didn't know anything about closing

158
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
I learned everything bites

159
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
If I get an idea immediately take a step

160
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,447
And see how that feels if it feels good I take another step it feels bad ice

161
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
You know it's different than people with a scientific

162
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Lakeview where they

163
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
Take everything out to the esta Gris before they make a move

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Try I learn by just doing

165
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
And one of the first products we met was a pair of climbing shorts and

166
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
I made the pattern for it I knew nothing about pattern-making I just took a pair of

167
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Shorts apart and I kind of looked at it and I

168
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
But I want to

169
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
He don't make a really tough pair of shorts so I use

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Canvas

171
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
From outdoor furniture

172
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Or something

173
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Palace Korean woman

174
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,287
For me and she had to show it on a walking foot machine which is the kind of sewing machine that

175
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Used for

176
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Sewing leather

177
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Cuz

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Fabric was so sick

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,247
And when she was done with him as she stood him up they stood straight up

180
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
So we need them stand up shorts and you know it took about 50 Washings to break him in but we still make those short

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Chris Noth is a heaviest

182
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
They were

183
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
It seems like

184
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Your

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Main motivation was to just make stuff that you would want to wear and use yourself but love nobody's making stuff

186
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Good enough

187
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
And you were just sort of like

188
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
I guess I have to take it

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Yeah you know I I I

190
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
I used to do every

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Conceivable

192
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Sport

193
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
And then the people that work for me where all

194
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Sports

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Also we knew

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
What we wanted

197
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
You know what I heard somebody say that

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
You wait for the customer to tell you what to do you're too late

199
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
So we were our own custom

200
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
And I think that was the secret

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Coming out with pride

202
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
A lot of products people didn't even know they

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
They want it or need it

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
When you start to do this

205
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,055
And you have to hire employees and you have to form a company and you have to

206
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Deal with payroll like disaster to scare you

207
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Oh yeah

208
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
Yeah that was pretty scary and we made a lot of mistakes

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
And in fact we were so successful in the

210
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Ladies

211
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
We were growing too fast we're going to 50

212
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
2% of here

213
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,023
And now you can't do that for very long before you

214
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Run out of money basically

215
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
On retainer ninja can't do that

216
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
And so we were also

217
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
Ramped-up to grow 50% and we only grew

218
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
25 or so

219
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
Which doesn't sound bad but when you build all the inventory for

220
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Her that and you don't make it

221
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,831
Is pretty rough and then there was a recession down and and the banks wouldn't give us any more money in fact

222
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
I had to

223
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Laying people off

224
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Was really hard because we're

225
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Family

226
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Spell business

227
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Renew everybody

228
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Working there

229
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
That was really tough

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
DJ moments

231
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
During those periods

232
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
The ups and downs what you thought

233
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Patagonia might fail

234
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Oh absolutely

235
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
We didn't know where they were going to make it or not

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
We couldn't get any loans from anybody

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
My account

238
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,991
Introduce me to some Mafia guys who understand Oklahoma

239
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
Some money at 18% interest

240
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Which I turned down but

241
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
What day does this is we got some personal loans from

242
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Some friends and pretty much fired some management

243
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
That got us in this problem and turn things around

244
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
Why do you think it happened was it just bad luck was it

245
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
The economy or was it

246
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Was there

247
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
A strategy that

248
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
We were just going for growth

249
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
You know not saying no

250
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
It's just so gross can creep up on you I mean we were just opening

251
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
More more dealers are opening their own retail stores

252
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
He'll nothing goes forever

253
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
In fact that's why the faster a business grows too fast

254
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
And so

255
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Once we got out of this we decided

256
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
To put ourselves on a

257
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Growth

258
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Program so that

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
We would be in business a hundred years from now

260
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
So all decisions

261
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
Then on were made as if we're going to be here a hundred years from now

262
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
So what

263
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Slowing down the girl saying no

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
To a lot of opportunities

265
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
And just being more responsible

266
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Like like how

267
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
It just

268
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
I don't

269
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
Prime the pump I don't we don't advertise it

270
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Vanity Fair to get new customer

271
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
Affect our advertising budget

272
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
1/2 of 1

273
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Percent of sales

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
And so

275
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
I wait for the customer to tell us

276
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
How much to make

277
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055

309
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
It's how I built this from NPR guy Raz

310
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,663
Took that tough. In the early 1990s

311
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
Devon and his team started to focus less

312
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
I'm grilling and

313
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Moron

314
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Lasting

315
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
As a company

316
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
And it's hard to do things like

317
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Use more environmentally friendly

318
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Material

319
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
And they also started to do something

320
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
A bit weird for a business

321
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Instead of

322
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Telling customers

323
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Buy their stuff

324
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Patagonia kind of told them

325
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
YouTube

326
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Yeah

327
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Believe

328
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
This company is the resource that I have

329
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
And that I should use that resource

330
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
To show a different way of doing business

331
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
In fact we now have the largest

332
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Garmin repair center in North America

333
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Wheel repair every single

334
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Piece of Patagonia matter how old it is

335
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Indefinitely

336
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
In fact we've got a truck.

337
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
It's going around the country

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
Repairing people's clothes no matter whether they're Patagonia or not

339
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
And then we're trying to teach people that

340
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
You don't throw things away do you repair them

341
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
And then we've committed ourselves

342
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
To owning

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
The product forever

344
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
So when we sell you a jacket we still on it

345
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
If you get overweight already

346
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Tired of the color of whatever you want to get rid of it will help you

347
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Sell it

348
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
To somebody else

349
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
If breaks down will fix it

350
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Fish finally you know completely shot

351
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,255
You give it back to us and we'll recycle it into

352
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Morgarath

353
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
So it forces us

354
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
To use

355
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,423
Fibers that can be recycled if Forces 2

356
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,543
Design a jacket that you can replace a zipper cuz it's very easy

357
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Design one where you can't replace it

358
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Is change the whole way we do business

359
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
Yeah so like what about you how many

360
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
White Patagonia jacket

361
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
You'd be surprised at all my stuff is

362
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Years and years old

363
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
Sitting here talking to you my pants are probably seven or eight years old my shirt is

364
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Probably the same

365
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
But you know it's it's kind of interesting

366
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Friend of mine went to

367
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Garage sale in Jackson Hole recently

368
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
And there was a

369
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Jacket

370
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
That we made about

371
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
10 years ago in those purple man's great shape

372
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
The woman wanted $3

373
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
So you offer 15 sheets

374
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Anyone on eBay

375
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Anna guy from Japan said hey

376
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
I'd like to buy that jacket how much you want

377
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
You don't make me an offer

378
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Tulalip how about 750

379
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
So actually

380
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Distance keep their value

381
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,887
Which is pretty amazing and that mean the thing is like a new Patagonia jacket is not exactly

382
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Cheap stuff

383
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Yes oh yeah I mean we have a

384
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Lifetime guarantee and we

385
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Can't make things cheaply

386
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
I'm for trying to make

387
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,943
The very very highest quality we we can and it's

388
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
You know it's like organic food is

389
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Cost more than regular food

390
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,879
Is it true that many causes you no less harm the environment and so

391
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Black people pay for that

392
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
And I'm not interested

393
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
And coming out with a line of

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Inexpensive clothes

395
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
You know it's kind of like eating meat

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
I eat meat but I eat

397
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Tiny little bit at a time I don't either

398
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
16 oz

399
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Pour House

400
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
And I think

401
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
US Clothing we're telling people look sink twice

402
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,431
If you're going to buy a jack at the skin by one that you can also wear over your

403
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Sukkot in New York City in a rainstorm

404
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
Should I don't sit in the closet 9 months a year

405
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,927
And so on phone fewer things but really good things

406
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
What is

407
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,047
Is party still conflicted over this idea that even with all the

408
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Responsible things you do

409
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
You are still part of

410
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Consumer world

411
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Ya know that

412
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
We certainly are yet

413
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
And that's why we try to

414
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Can I put a spin on it by

415
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Don't tell me our customers

416
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Twice

417
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Before they buy

418
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
Anything not just our product but anything

419
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
You have

420
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
No

421
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
College degree

422
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Business Degree you're not

423
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
Like you are not a businessman but you are I mean became one

424
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Andeavor Fred that you cost

425
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Call yourself a relaxing businessman

426
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
But do you feel uncomfortable with that title

427
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
No not at all because I think

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
What I did is once I decided that was it

429
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,383
And I decided to really study up on it I studied every book I could on

430
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Japanese

431
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Management styles

432
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Scandinavian businesses

433
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
Cuz I thought there had to be a different way of doing business

434
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
And

435
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
I still want it only work

436
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
For part of the Year myself

437
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
You know I I take off from

438
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,119
June until November I'm gone I got a place in Jackson Hole and I go fishing every day and

439
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
I called him maybe three times

440
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
In the five months

441
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Lamp

442
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
People know that if the warehouse burns down don't call me what can I do you know what to do

443
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
How are you able to do that

444
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Well

445
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
You know I heard a great thing on NPR

446
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
TaxSlayer

447
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Fattest woman at Stanford

448
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Studies ants

449
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
She said that

450
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
You know ant colonies don't have

451
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
They don't have Bots

452
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
And everyone knows what their job is they get their job done and

453
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Compare that with dictators

454
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,775
It's a lot of companies are top-down management and it takes a tremendous amount of effort to run those

455
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
So what we decided to do is just higher

456
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
Motivated young independent people

457
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Leave me alone

458
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
Nme night I wrote a book called

459
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,903
Let my people go surfing and it's all about we have a policy that when the surf comes up

460
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Drop work and go surfing

461
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
I don't care when you work

462
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
As long as the job gets done

463
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
And I know I've had other companies

464
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,191
Come to me and say hello I love that idea I think I'm going to do it in my company I say

465
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Forget it you'll fail

466
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
Because you have to start with a very first person you hire

467
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
And

468
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
I've had

469
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Psychologist

470
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Studier

471
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Her employees and they said

472
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
I got to tell you

473
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Your employees are the most independent I've ever seen any company in fact they're so independent unemployable anywhere else

474
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
About the company

475
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
In the seventies you guys were doing

476
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Maternal and paternal leave

477
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
People taking their infant to daycare for the staff and

478
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Flexible work schedule think that we

479
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
Even to this day today are still

480
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Not that common and in all companies

481
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
YouTube

482
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
40 years

483
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,295
Oh yeah I mean we wanted ever kids

484
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
What does it work

485
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,647
Do you know who put them in a cardboard box on your desk in

486
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
And that work for a while but then

487
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
Judson Screamers

488
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
And so my wife and I started

489
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
A child care center

490
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
And we didn't want to just

491
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Somebody just babysitting these kids

492
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
You know we recognize it

493
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
05 is the most important

494
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Learning time of a

495
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Person's life

496
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
And so it's not a babysitting service

497
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
The kids are come out of our company or the

498
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
The best product that comes out

499
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Not once been in prison yet

500
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
All these things

501
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Cost the company

502
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Money

503
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
Well if we're going to be here a hundred years so you know it

504
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
We're not going to sell out we're not going to go public

505
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Cancel

506
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
It's good business

507
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
I mean I have

508
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
Probably 70% women workers

509
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
For me I have women and all upper management

510
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
And

511
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
I don't want to lose him

512
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Where did you

513
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
I mean a lot of the people that we talked to on the show are motivated by

514
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,183
In a wine to change an industry or change the way business is done or to change the world or two

515
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Make money

516
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
Nevermind I think everybody would agree that they wanted to make money

517
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,143
Isn't you where did you and where do you find the motivation to make

518
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
This company

519
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Ramen fries

520
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Well you know where my favorite quotes

521
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
If you want to understand

522
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Entrepreneur

523
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Study of the juvenile

524
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
Cuz they're saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way

525
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
I

526
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
I have a background of

527
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
As always the shortest guy around I could play

528
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Sports pretty well you know team sports but

529
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
When it came time for

530
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Actual game mode

531
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
I realize that

532
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,448
The best thing to do is invent your own sports than you can always be a winner and so

533
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,288
That's what the entrepreneur does they just say this is wrong

534
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Do it this other way

535
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
And if you want to be successful in business

536
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
You don't go up against Coca-Cola

537
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
These big companies are they'll kill you

538
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
You just do it differently

539
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
You figure out something that no one else has thought about

540
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,744
And you do it totally different way and so

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Breaking the rules

542
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
How you have to be creative

543
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
And that's the fun part of this

544
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
I love breaking the rules

545
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
You still must live by

546
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,032
By certain rules

547
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,128
Well I've been a student kind of sin Buddhism

548
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
What's my life

549
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
I believe in you.

550
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
The more you know the less you need

551
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
I've been fishing

552
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Fly fishing with one fly

553
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
The one type of

554
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Fly in different sizes

555
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
It has limited myself to that

556
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
For a whole year in

557
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
I caught more fish than I've ever caught in my life

558
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
I realize that all it is

559
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Hundreds of thousands of differ

560
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Fly patterns

561
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Eye colors

562
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Shapes and everything

563
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
You can replace all of that

564
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
With

565
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Knowledge

566
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
And

567
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
And it's a good lesson for me

568
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
Detritus Darcy in the world it's a simplify your life

569
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Cuz everything pulls you to be more and more complex

570
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
And so I think what I learned from

571
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Fly fishing

572
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Is that if we have to

573
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
Either were forced or we decide to go to a more Simple Life

574
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
It's not going to be an impoverished

575
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
It's going to be really rich

576
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
Banchan ourtinder of Patagonia

577
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,712
He never took a penny of investment by the way salons 100% of the company

578
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
And because of that the company doesn't make the numbers

579
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Publix open

580
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
Endless growth may not be Yvonne shanard sing

581
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,768
Patagonia reportedly did at three-quarters of a billion dollars in sales last year

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
Their best year ever

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

603
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Today we're updating a story we first ran last November when we spoke with Brett Johnson from Easton Massachusetts

604
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:16,288
What is something kind of interesting a couple years ago 2011-2012

605
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
There was a big cayenne pepper crazy kind of swept across the country

606
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
Really a lot of people were touting the health benefits of cayenne pepper and you know we kind of had this idea what if we could integrate

607
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
Cayenne pepper into throat lhasa

608
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,720
Cayenne pepper into a throat lozenge something they called

609
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Fire drops

610
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,072
You put in your mouth and it takes about 15 to 20 seconds for the actual

611
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Giant really hit you

612
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936
You can feel it in the back of your throat you feel this kind of soothing effect

613
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,800
Of the spice of the cayenne pepper I know this may not sound very soothing

614
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,152
But Brett says that the heat from the pepper actually feels really great on your throat

615
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,736
A lot of customers who are singers and actors

616
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:02,368
They really like the fire dropped because they feel as soon as their vocal cords and helps them kind of heal after night of performance

617
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
Richard that for now most of the people who are buying fire drops have

618
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Cold or sore throat

619
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
That means it's 3 years in

620
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
Company still has a small problem

621
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,168
We're seasonal business in summer time is a slow time for cold and sore throat

622
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,032
And so it becomes a challenge to figure out how to manage cash flow properly

623
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Let's Brett Johnson when we last heard from him fire drops were selling in about 15 stores and their chest about

624
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Break even

625
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Today princess fire drops are in 75 stores across the country the business is now.

626
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Turning a profit

627
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,256
In just a few weeks ago Brett quit his day job to work on fire drops full-time

628
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
