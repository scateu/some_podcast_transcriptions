1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
Okay so it's some point in the past decade

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,584
You are

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,608
Someone you know

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
Probably on

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,960
A simple pair of cloth shoes and there's a good chance

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
That's those shoes

7
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
They have been taught

8
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,312
Because in the past decade

9
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,152
Blake mycoskie built a multimillion-dollar shoe Empire

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,736
Inspired by a simple cloth shoe he once saw

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
In Argentina

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Pippa blake Journey

13
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
Cashews

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
A lot of detours

15
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
The story first ran in

16
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
2017

17
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Enjoy

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
Well I kind of freaked out and I got this like smaller

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
Army of interns to help basically be customer service to email and call all these people let him know that

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
There is no chance that they're going to get their shoes in the four days or five days the website promise there's going to be more like

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Couple months and I literally pretty pointy Cyrus took a taxi to this guy's house

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
House one Torres who is making the shoes in his garage Force the time and I walked in and with the

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
A little Spanish I knew I said something like muchos Zapatos rapido

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
NPR

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
How I built this

26
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
Show about innovators entrepreneurs

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Idealist

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Stories

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Behind the movement

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
They built

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,952
Turn a Goodwill Mission into a multimillion-dollar shoe Empire

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,536
Create a business model unlike anything anyone

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Seen before

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
So I should

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Probably let you know

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
Right at the exit here that

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Today's show is going to be

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
A little bit different

39
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Because normally

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
In the first half of the show we hear the story of how an entrepreneur painstakingly build his or her

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Business

42
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
From the ground up

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
And then get a

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
How it goes from there right and in in normally it's just

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
1

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Business

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
But with Blake mycoskie

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
It is not just one

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Because

50
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Before he even turned 30

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
He's already launched

52
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
Four companies in some of them did pretty well

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
And as for his best-known business Tom shoes

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336
What have you been going to get there for a while so hang tight

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,480
Blake's very first business dates back to the mid-1990s when he was a freshman in college

56
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Grown up keeping up pretty good tennis player

57
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
He even played against Andy Roddick and ice

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,952
And Blake was recruited to play at Southern Methodist University

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Everything was going according to plan

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,096
That is until one day when he injured his

61
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Achilles tendon

62
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
I've had this

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
Spitcast on and crutches and I wasn't able to play tennis for

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Several months I had

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Did rehab

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
But everything I can do is actually couldn't carry my laundry

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
I'll head down to the facility in the college dorm

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
And so my laundry

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Piling up in my room and my roommate

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
It was probably not liking it that much and

71
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
This is hard to believe but this is back

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
Before any search engine so we had to yellow pee

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
And I remember looking in the Yellow Pages

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Define a place that would come pick up

75
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
And deliver my laundry back to me because

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
I physically couldn't do it

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,520
And and there's nothing like that in Dallas that I can find at the time

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
There come to the campus and do that and

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
That ultimately led to

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
My first business

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Easy laundry

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,296
Blake partnered with his roommate and eventually they figured out that the key to getting customers

83
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Listen to the students

84
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Actually through their parents

85
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
So the next year

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Quienes roommate got a boost

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
At the freshman orientation

88
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
The parents are kind of going there's kind of signing up for every

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
They're getting the books they're getting this again that

90
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Navigate to the laundry thingy

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
They don't know how long we've been in business or if every kid on campus does it or not but

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Cashiers

93
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
The chance to

94
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
You know sign their kid up for something that's not that expensive Ville

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
Help make sure that the kids don't ruin their clothes or freshman year they haven't been used to Washington

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Drawing your own clothes

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Roseanne

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Sometime that they can use for other things

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
We are pretty good

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Kitchen

101
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
Within the series like two or three days we did like $80,000 in

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Prepaid laundry sales

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
What's the year

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,583
When are the actually expanded to four other colleges in Texas

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,703
And then they were doing so well that Blake dropped out of SMU to focus in

106
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Harley on the company

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
And after a few years

108
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
They decided to sell it

109
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
So at

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
21

111
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Blake walked away with about

112
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
$100,000

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
And lots of time

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
To kill

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
And I actually took a trip out to Los Angeles for the first time

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
And I'm just take a little bit of time off is it a cup

117
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Friends are going to school out here

118
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
And when I was in LA I saw these

119
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
This huge

120
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
Advertising displays on the side the building

121
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Now

122
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Drawing of a Texas I'd never seen

123
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
I never seen like a massive

124
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Add

125
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
I'm for an iPhone or a movie or whatever

126
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Your painted on the side of a building

127
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Yeah there was a lot of that in Los an

128
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
And I noticed that they're not only was a lot of it but there was almost

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Exclusively advertising movies and

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
TV shows

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
So the specific industry the LA was known for

132
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,207
And I remember sitting there that she's thing at Mel's Diner on

133
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Sunset I'll never forget this moment

134
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,583
And I was looking at this massive ad for I think one of the first Jurassic

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
City Park movies

136
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,727
This is so powerful that there's no way you can tune out this type of our ties

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
It's bigger than life

138
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
It's exciting

139
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
You know I wanted to go see the movie because of the DeWalt skate was so exciting it

140
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
Underneath a had a name of a company van Wagner

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Company that owned that space

142
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
Can I call Dan Wagner into the AI company and I really want to do

143
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
Really big in LA and unsalted add you anyways could I rent this side of the building on Sunset and it's as well

144
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
Actually have a year-long contract with

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Warner Brothers for that one

146
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
So we can't we have mother one in town

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
How much would it cost if I wanted to rent this one and he said something

148
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
I think you said it was like

149
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
$85,000 a month

150
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
You are a course

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Pretending like you just want to get the information

152
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
If he says 85000

153
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
85000 a month

154
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
I'm thinking hold on that means that building owners making over $1000000 a year

155
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Just by renting

156
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
The side of their building and he has two sides cuz the building

157
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Faces Sunset two different ways

158
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
The $2000000 on one building

159
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
And I thought there's no cost like all you doing is just painting or putting the vinyl on there's no like actual billboards

160
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Structure

161
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,151
Steel and all that stuff you have to do like this it

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
This is incredible

163
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
I just start thinking to myself like who would pay 85

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
$5,000

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
And like

166
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Why cuz there's no way that can make

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Sixth Sense

168
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
On a

169
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
Cost per thousand or an advertising

170
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Images 9f

171
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
People that drive

172
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Sunset

173
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
What I was thinking

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,607
And so the reason I basically came up with my mind was

175
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
It had to be you

176
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
You had to be there like all the studios in town when

177
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Their movies

178
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
On the note on the street they want to show the

179
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Actor

180
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,175
Starlet like I can put you on this building and like how big a deal is that

181
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
Isaac in Nashville the time and I made a quick

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,391
Assumption that the country music industry had maybe not as big egos but definitely some big egos in town and

183
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
What if I put country music stars on the side of the building

184
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
So is that is that what you did

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,839
Yeah so I went back to Nashville and got after it in

186
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
Mom found out that you know there's no one that has ever done this in Nashville

187
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
I and it was very

188
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,567
You're challenging to get the city to allow me to do it ultimately I had to

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Convince the city

190
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Because I had the highway beautification act which

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
Kept people from putting up any new Billboards I think like after year 1984

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
I'm so

193
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
What I ultimately came up with after like

194
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Countless City Council meetings

195
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Discussions

196
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
This and that was

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
I was going to

198
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,863
Actually make the city More Beautiful cuz I was going to create country music art

199
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,471
And so what I did was I actually would put the album cover

200
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Of the new Dixie

201
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
She checks are Shania Twain or whoever was coming out

202
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Album

203
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
But there would be no like

204
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Call to action no light

205
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Available at Best Buy for 999

206
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
It was just that the art of the album

207
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
And by doing that

208
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
I convinced the city I was adding to the landscape of Nashville which is all about country music so what would you do

209
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
It had this idea all you have to do is give me

210
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Decided your building and you get

211
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
See I did it the thing you don't ever want to do especially when you're 22 years old again trying to talk to the 50 and 60 year old people who

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Apartment complexes

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
You don't want to use the word ID

214
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Because if it's just an idea then it's like

215
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
You're not going to inspire a lot of coffee

216
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Yeah because people can say

217
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
I don't like your idea

218
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
I don't believe your idea but if you say I have a business

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
And what we do

220
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Is wheelies

221
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
You know the side of your building

222
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
And will guarantee you this amount of money

223
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,767
Money per month and we're going to resell the side of your building cuz we specialize

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
In selling advertising

225
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
To the music industry end

226
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,935
You'll make money on NASA that you never thought you would ever make me

227
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Wow are you

228
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
You're basically hustling

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,615
00 Hustler I mean there's no doubt like I mean anyone is an entrepreneur

230
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Especially if they start really young

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
I mean you got a fake it till you make it

232
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
And

233
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
You know and I was I was never being

234
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Dishonest

235
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Nostalgia saying

236
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,159
This is what I'm doing and they had nothing to lose like by signing a contract

237
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Just me

238
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
Then they were basically saying okay if you go out and least this

239
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
The Dixie Chicks

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Jose

241
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
And you can lease it for 10000 bucks

242
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
You're going to give me 30% of that

243
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Just for me allowing you to do this

244
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
That's that's $3,000 a month

245
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
To a place that made with charging $500 a month for apartments OKC I just

246
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Created 6 new apartments that they didn't even have to take care of

247
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
So how did you get the first

248
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Company or who are

249
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,879
Label to agree to let you work with them to put their album art like how did you even

250
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Have those connections an end

251
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
How did you make that

252
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,303
It was just cold calling you know I mean found out who had albums coming out

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Did some research and then

254
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
I contacted

255
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,935
Yeah the marketing person said hey I know you're getting ready to promote

256
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Get a disc this album and

257
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
I have a way you can promote it

258
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,615
Larger than Life right here in Nashville it's going to make a big impact

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
You can be one of the first to do it

260
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Miserable things that marketing people love to hear ya

261
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
And and

262
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
Who's your first client was the first piece of art that you put up on the sun side of a building

263
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Amy Grant

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
And

265
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
We did it on the side of a Ramada Hotel in downtown

266
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
There's a picture of me and and my partner who is helping me with

267
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
The time standing in front of it

268
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,983
You know I'm that cover the Nashville newspaper when it came out and it was great and then what we had that with credibility

269
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
And then we just started

270
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Yes I want in writing

271
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Left

272
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
What did the label pay for that

273
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
I think we charge for that one about

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
I want to say 15000 a month

275
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
So if you work we are probably cash flowing. 10000 a month

276
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Answers for that one wall

277
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,183
Do you think you have the confidence to do that because you had done the laundry business

278
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
In college

279
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Yeah I mean I learned a lot I've started laundry business name

280
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
19

281
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,167
So I didn't you know kind of hustling and building and having employees and learning about customer service

282
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
The morning Valley things for about 4 years

283
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
So when I had this idea I had to pay a little bit more confidence

284
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,151
And you don't have nothing to lose you know it's like they they were going to say yesterday weren't and

285
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
I've always been good with you no like

286
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Just Taking Chances and

287
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
And see what happens

288
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
So eventually

289
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
You

290
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Black Nashville

291
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Which US company

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
So I end up selling the company to Clear Channel

293
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,375
Take me to company that was really big in the outdoor advertising we ended up having walls in Nashville and we

294
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Expanded to Dallas to

295
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
And once I got to Dallas I realize that this was like a

296
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
A big business game like I'd had some

297
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Small successes

298
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,455
But it was very quickly that the big companies like the viacom's Clear Channel is van Wagner

299
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
They were onto my game

300
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
And it was going to be hard.

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
So did you walk out of that

302
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Teal

303
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
More less

304
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Set

305
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Pretty set yeah I mean

306
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Every everything is is relative right

307
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
But I definitely had a nice

308
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Cash flow

309
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Coming in from that that I wasn't having

310
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
Jumped Outlet find a job so when I moved to LA

311
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
It was more kind of

312
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Car finance

313
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Exploring what could be knack

314
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
Text and I was fascinated with reality television and how is B

315
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Popular

316
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,223
This is like right after like the first Survivor came out and it just fast

317
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
I think the competitiveness in me

318
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
I did Venture that you know like all that

319
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
And

320
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
You're not worth thinking about

321
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Applying

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Survivor and we actually did apply for

323
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Survivor Wii U

324
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
You wanted to be contestants on Survivor

325
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Yeah

326
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
And

327
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
The casting people Survivor also

328
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
Show casting this new show called The Amazing Race

329
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
And they called us up and said hey I

330
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,407
I don't think we can put you and your sister on Survivor but they knew about the Amazing Race and so they

331
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Can I talk to send to

332
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Thinking about the Amazing Race and so we got into the process of

333
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Being interviewed for that

334
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
And we got on

335
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
And then the actual show itself is 31 days so we literally disappeared from our world for 31 days

336
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
We can really tell anyone we're doing

337
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
Super confidential

338
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,447
We just like disappeared from my country to Country right

339
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Yeah it's all of the world and

340
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
We're done the hard part was the show with and start

341
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Caring for another you know

342
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Couple months

343
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
So we couldn't Taiwan

344
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
What happened

345
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,063
You know if we won or if we didn't win how far we got

346
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Not to spoil the ending for anyone cuz

347
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
Is there 2002 but you barely

348
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463

00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
Want you guys almost 1 billion box

And thankful you didn't cuz I think that

352
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
That would have been a positive thing at that moment

353
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
It probably wouldn't have

354
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Been good for my

355
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191

00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
Ubitus presumably you didn't really have to

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Work if you

367
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Bright enough to whole lot

368
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
Yeah I mean I was definitely about the money like you

369
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
Every business of EverStart has been more of a curiosity

370
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
And it kind of what if

371
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
And so

372
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
As I just got off The Amazing Race

373
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
Looking around and seeing how

374
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Popular reality television

375
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Be coming in

376
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Understanding the basic metrics of

377
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Advertising and what advertisers

378
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
There's one

379
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Targeting and all that

380
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
I just got really excited at the idea of the network of

381
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
If you really having your own channel

382
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
And it would be

383
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
Play focus on reality and reality

384
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
TV stars that like a cable

385
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Tvl

386
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
It just amazing to me because I remember when I was 25

387
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
Funniest random bike

388
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
You know start my career. But

389
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
I mean

390
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
I don't know Timmy 25 girls who sang

391
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Restart cable

392
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
TV channel like that

393
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
It's a pretty

394
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Bold idea to have

395
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Yeah

396
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
I mean absolutely

397
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
But I felt like you know I feel like it was pause

398
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Opelika

399
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Just

400
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
It seems like

401
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
I was in this position I started to understand by being on the show

402
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
When did interested

403
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
People hiding

404
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
We're just about finding the right

405
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
People that knew how to do it and then figure out a way to channel

406
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Their energy and

407
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Get the right capital

408
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
All together to do it

409
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
So so did you raise money for it

410
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
So I did

411
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
So I

412
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Basically

413
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
I tracked down

414
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Are the gentlemen who is the founder of the e-channel

415
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
And somehow got a meeting with him

416
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
And then he kind of said

417
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,271
It look like it's so competitive now to start a channel

418
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
No

419
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Probably about

420
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Klystron 9 box maybe 700

421
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
$50,000 you would need

422
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Just

423
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
To get

424
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
The lights turned on

425
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
And I said why I definitely have

426
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Have $750,000

427
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
Did the time bet on this right off the gate

428
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
But I do know some people

429
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Who really understand reality

430
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
And who have some money

431
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Maybe they'd invest in my idea was it

432
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
To go to all the winners

433
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Are the reality shows the last

434
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
2 years

435
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
And get them to invest

436
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
You said you guys should all the best let's start a reality TV

437
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
And I got them all to invest in and then I put some more money in it

438
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
Within a couple months I raised 7 + 50000 +

439
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
We lunch

440
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
What was called reality Center

441
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
So you raise money and then

442
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
And then what do you do start

443
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Like producing a reality show

444
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
No the whole idea was it we were

445
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Acquire the content

446
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Next to nothing

447
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
You know I to Teresa

448
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
And then we would act

449
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
Late do,

450
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
Mystery Dinner Theater where you had someone come on it was on the showtime

451
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
Talk you through quote app

452
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
That's a good idea

453
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Yeah so we had it was

454
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
But you know so we really don't have to spend money on

455
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
Hunting is more about trying to get

456
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Which ultimately was

457
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
The Achilles heel and wide

458
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Twerking

459
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Do we have to go to LA

460
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Comcast

461
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Time Warner

462
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
Charter needs big organizations take car cable networks

463
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
The host all the channels

464
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
And convince them that they should

465
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Give us a slot

466
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Of the 105

467
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
And ultimately we couldn't convince

468
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Of that

469
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
You know it's funny cuz I I sir you

470
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
Tell the story and I think of you as somebody who

471
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Has really

472
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
Try to make the world a better place and I don't know if it's

473
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
If your 24-hour reality channel would have made the world a better place. It wouldn't have been I'm so thankful that it didn't work

474
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,847
I would write 5 in a shoot myself if I was running light outside

475
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
I mean there's something

476
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Genius about and something

477
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
Really horrible

478
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,039
What happened with all the people who

479
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Including you put who put money into

480
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Unfortunately we all lost

481
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
It was really hard.

482
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Pretty depressed for a while

483
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
I've let go everyone

484
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
It was challenging

485
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
So when that

486
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
All kind of collapse

487
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
What did you

488
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
At the Disco

489
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,127
So I mean companies three that that now we are thinking the overarching theme of my aunt

490
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Rural Life

491
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
Which I'm really thankful for is been like there's been no

492
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Connection

493
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
From one business

494
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
To another

495
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Literally been me following

496
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,927
Kind of my Curiosities and the serendipitous

497
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Conversations

498
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Experiences I have

499
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
And so the next business

500
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Holy that way

501
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
I was actually at a barbecue

502
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
As we were

503
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Kind of closing down

504
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
The real Channel

505
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
And one of the

506
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
People that work for me they had a son that was

507
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
15 years old

508
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
When he was there

509
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
And I was asking him what he was doing that summer

510
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:02,015
You're making small talk and waiting for burger or something and he told me he was doing driver's ed

511
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
And I said all that

512
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
So exciting I mean learn to drive

513
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
And he responded like

514
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
Totally in uninspiring way I mean you just said like

515
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Yats

516
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
Okay you know I go this

517
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Please

518
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
The teacher boring

519
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
I pretty much sleeps

520
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
To the class

521
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,519
First off this is not good our future drivers in LA or sleeping

522
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Anchor their driver's ed class

523
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Method

524
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
Make Me Feel Good by getting on the highway in the second thing is like

525
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
I mean getting your license

526
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
Should be like this amazing experience for 15 year olds

527
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
And there's got to be a

528
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
A better way

529
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
To engage them

530
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
Yeah and I just thought guys like all these teenagers

531
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Just trying to be online more and more

532
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
You know maybe there's a way to

533
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Can it take this

534
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
Driver's ed instruction and learning

535
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Into

536
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
The technology

537
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Teenagers from bracing out though

538
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
So I had this idea just kind of started a new

539
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Type of driver's ed company

540
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
We would do all the instruction online

541
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
You have to pass things

542
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,271
In sequential manner so you can really make sure that they're learning and they're paying attention like

543
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
It couldn't just like

544
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Cram for the final test you would have to

545
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
You get the stages almost like a video game

546
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
And I recognized it

547
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
One of the ways to get them to pay attention and be more excited

548
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Did about

549
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
The actual learning to

550
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Drive

551
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Was

552
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
To have

553
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911

NPR

623
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
I got a ride

624
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
So it's 2006

625
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
And lakes driver's ed businesses

626
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Taking off

627
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Making good money

628
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Life

629
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
But he's feeling a little bored a little

630
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Restless

631
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
So he decided to take a break and

632
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Do something a little unusual

633
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
He thought

634
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,736
What do I learn to play polo in

635
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Argentina

636
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
And

637
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Who's actually

638
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
After about being down there for about 3 weeks

639
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,208
When I met serendipitously a few women that were

640
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
And Wine Bar

641
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,376
That were talking to me in English which is nice as most everyone is speaking Spanish and I didn't understand most of what they were saying

642
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
And when I

643
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
Asked about what they were doing

644
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
Explain they were doing something

645
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
Hey characterizes a shoe Drive

646
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
And what that meant was they were going around

647
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,200
Collecting slightly used shoes from wealthy families in Buenos Aires

648
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
How to take two children

649
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
Who did not have shoes and couldn't afford shoes that needed them to go to school

650
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
And I was just really taken by

651
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,976
By their passion for this project and the fact that

652
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
Kids just outside of Buenos Aires to dinner

653
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Shoes cuz

654
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
That was something new kind of new to me and

655
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
You know I asked enough questions to get interested

656
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
And they offered me to come with him

657
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
Help distribute the shoes and I said sure

658
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
They said

659
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Check out this

660
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,968
Yeah they were going like a week later and I was going to be down there still on

661
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
So yeah so what happened

662
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
The experience was

663
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
An amazing one of me I didn't have

664
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Really any experience

665
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
Point about volunteering or

666
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Being in a place of

667
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Poverty and

668
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
But I saw these kids really light up

669
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
When they got the

670
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,912
These shoes and they weren't even new shoes these were used shoes

671
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Biggest potato

672
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
The kids were acting like it was

673
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Christmas Day weather

674
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Parents are excited and

675
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Joy and if we put

676
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
She's on the kids who played with him to jump rope Loop

677
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Quit soccer we did all these things

678
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
And it was just a great day

679
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
And so I went back that evening and I was talking to my

680
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Paula teachers in Vallejo

681
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
About the experience

682
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
And

683
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,208
And telling him what a great day I had and how

684
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Nioh how satisfying

685
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Wasn't

686
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
How's it going on and on

687
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
You know I can hear gushing

688
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
With enthusiasm

689
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,960
And then he asked me a question that I really wasn't prepared for he said Blake is it this is

690
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
Amazing what you've done and I'm

691
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
I commend you and

692
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
Doing this in my country and

693
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
I know what area you were in today and at the very challenging area

694
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Families

695
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Is it but what happens when the kids

696
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
You grow out of the shoes

697
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
Is there when they wear out of

698
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
It's our only pair they're going to wear out of

699
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
And I said

700
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
I don't know

701
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
And his question kind of haunted

702
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,768
Give me to be honest cuz all of sudden I thought guy

703
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
We actually do something good or did we just

704
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,656
Further propagate a problem that they're going to have down the road

705
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
And I remember that night like

706
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
Actually having a little trouble sleeping and kind of wrestling with this

707
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
This question he asked

708
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
So

709
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
I woke up the next morning and when the things I've done since I was

710
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
Like 15 years old as I write in my

711
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
My journal on my server

712
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
And I found a cup of coffee and reading my journal and

713
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
Cat thinking about is questioning

714
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,136
It all seemed like cats this idea of like

715
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
Okay well if I really want to help you

716
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,720
These kids which I really did I really connected

717
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
This group

718
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
Maybe I go and get all my friends to donate shoes a couple times a year and we bring them down

719
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
I thought well

720
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Yeah that's

721
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,752
Once again dependent on other people's donations and what if they don't do it and

722
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
And it doesn't seem like a very sad

723
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Sustainable way

724
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
To give these key

725
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Kid shoes and then

726
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
That led to

727
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
You know what

728
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
What if there was a busy

729
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Set up a charity and donation

730
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
What if I actually started a

731
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
A shoe business

732
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
And every time I sold a pair of shoes

733
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
I would give a pair away

734
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
What

735
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
What kind of shoes did you have in mind

736
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
Volcano at the same time I've been Argentina for about a month and I've noticed that a lot of the polo players and evens for the girl

737
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Girlfriends were wearing

738
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
The shoes called the alpargata

739
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
And it was kind of like an espadrille type

740
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Canvas shoes that was

741
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
I'm very different

742
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Can anything I've ever seen in the US

743
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
And just like

744
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
Magic card game together

745
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
What if I sold these shoes

746
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
Is that everyone down here is wearing

747
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
The people who never seen them

748
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
And come back here and give away shoes to kids and eat them

749
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,720
What did you how did you even get started

750
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,816
So we just started meeting with people in town made these shoes

751
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Asking them like a can you change this

752
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
They all folks crazy because what they all

753
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
You know what the country is in Argentina with everyone appreciate that she was there really inexpensive and they work on disposable and they were

754
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
You know. Something that

755
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Put too much investment into

756
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
People can buy them

757
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
You never

758
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Month or two or couple months

759
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
I need a new pair

760
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
And so

761
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
They thought some of our changes was in

762
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Make ashy way too expensive

763
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
They didn't understand that

764
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
We had a market

765
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Hey cuz

766
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
If you were paying 40 bucks

767
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
Caravans if I can make something to eat

768
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
Have the same you know kind of longevity then

769
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
They're paid 40 bucks for this

770
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Small-time artisanal

771
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Shoemakers ovadia

772
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
We will make it in the garage is or making them in

773
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Indifferent yes small little Barns and factories

774
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
So we got

775
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
Some ideas in

776
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,112
They protect them really rapidly cuz they were small organization

777
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
And we made a couple hundred pairs of like prototypes

778
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
And

779
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
In the name Toms

780
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Was birth

781
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
There are created down there to be

782
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Because

783
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
When I totally hear what I want to do I said

784
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
I think if we sell a pair of shoes today

785
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Will give away a pair of shoes

786
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Tomorrow

787
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
And will come tomorrow shoes

788
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
And our slogan will be shoes for a better tomorrow is all around this word

789
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Tomorrow

790
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
And

791
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
When it came time to

792
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
Put a tag on the shoe

793
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,880
We couldn't fit the word tomorrow is on

794
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Attack

795
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Tigers with small in the heel

796
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
So we shortened the word tomorrow's to Thompson

797
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
And that's how the word Tom's game

798
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,936
Until you get back to the US How many pairs of shoes did

799
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
About 250

800
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
What's your idea

801
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Could you see if this would

802
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,408
Work like because you could have come back to the US and people would have said

803
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,760
Or you could have sold them all and then

804
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
And then what

805
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Yeah it was definitely

806
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
I try to stress this

807
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
List of people I mean

808
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Of all the businesses

809
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
Did I started this was the least

810
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Business of the business

811
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,816
Janet the irony of all of it was like okay there's 250 kids in

812
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Santa's Village

813
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
I want to come back by Christmas

814
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
And give them all a new pair of shoes

815
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
So I'm going to go sell these shoes and I'ma come back

816
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
And then we'll figure out

817
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Like it was not a business it was

818
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Clearly like

819
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
This is a way for me to

820
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
Kind of stay connected to this amazing feeling I had it helping these kids

821
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
And an excuse to come back Georgia

822
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Tina which I'd totally fall in love with

823
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,136
And and that was it and I still did the driver's ed business I'm still kind of

824
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm having normal life

825
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Is an entrepreneur

826
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,488
This is kind of be my side project in my kind of

827
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Own personal

828
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
You know

829
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
Fun philanthropic

830
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Experiment

831
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
And so

832
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
When you came back

833
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424

What you do

838
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
I mean first I say I kind of got

839
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Some friends and mice

840
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664

And they luckily they like them they thought they were cool and they were different than they liked

844
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344

Price isn't

848
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
37

849
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
And so

850
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
I sold a few pairs that way and then I got

851
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
The people local people in La that worked in

852
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
NPR that I

853
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424

Clearly that

862
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,832
Answer my first account was a store in La called American Rag

863
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
I went in there with a lily a backpack full of shoes

864
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,744
Some pictures of the kids that we had helped in Argentina

865
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
And

866
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,096

Well I kind of freaked out

905
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,664
I also did what I think let entrepreneurs doing a time of dire need a start

906
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
It's me ads

907
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Tips for interns

908
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
On Craigslist

909
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
So that good

910
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,088
And I got this like small army of interns

911
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
The help

912
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Basically be customer

913
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
Car service to email and call Aldi

914
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Did people let him know that

915
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
There is no chance

916
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,072
Said they're going to get their shoes in the four days or five days the website

917
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Promise there's going to be more like

918
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Couple months

919
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Longer

920
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Because I had to go back and make them in Argentina

921
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
You literally had to

922
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,640
Havana plane and go back like 3 days later after I get the intern set up with

923
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,992

927
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:35,488
Filipina Cyrus took a taxi to this guy's house one Torres who is making the shoes

928
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280

With the little Spanish I knew I said

933
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Something like that

00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Issues and

941
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
We got our own little kind of small little fact

I'm out of this little operation

00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304

947
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
So you have

948
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
2200 pairs of shoes

949
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
And

950
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Did you ship them back did you like

951
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032

968
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,088
I'm serious we are running shipping the stuff out of the apartment everyday and

969
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,184
And then because of that we getting more orders online and we started talking

970
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Doors

971
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
Damn you are like on a roll already at this

972
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Is playing right now

973
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
And then the next big break was

974
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
We got a call

975
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
From Vogue magazine and

976
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,568
And that funny thing about that was I had just seen the movie The Devil Wears Prada

977
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
Summer I see Meryl Streep video playing Anna Wintour

978
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
And I see how

979
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,296
Challenging she is Anne Hathaway's character and when I got a call from

980
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
From Vogue to come to New York to me

981
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,184
I was horrified I wanted you to come there to meet them

982
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,536
Well I'm the one interview me and they did read the LA Times article

983
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
So

984
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,656
C I went and interviewed me and then later they did a photoshoot in Venice and

985
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
Next thing you know we're in Vogue and when were in Vogue

986
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Just all kind of

987
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
What exploded

988
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,568
Everyone the crazy thing is it

989
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,152
People just assume like we were like a real company when we are in Vogue

990
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
And so

991
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,760
We are getting calls from my storage all the country even

992
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Celebrity star

993
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
That was also the benefit of thing of being in LA and that it was just

994
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,768
Such a radical idea like no fashion company or shoe company has ever like

995
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
Giving something away every time they sold it in

996
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
I think that naturally appeal to certain

997
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Celebrities in

998
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
And they also like

999
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
You're wearing things

1000
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Other people don't have in life

1001
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
It's new and so

1002
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
So we just started like without any work on her own we just started

1003
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:36,736
Sing celebrities wearing the shoes and they start being photographed by the paparazzi and then it starts showing up in

1004
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,552
Things like People magazine and US Weekly and

1005
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Okay

1006
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,928
The craziest moment for me was when I saw a stranger

1007
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Actually wearing

1008
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
That was about

1009
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,328
Three or four months later I was actually in New York

1010
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
Trying to sign up some new stores

1011
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
This is bright before Bo came out

1012
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,032
Discouraged I was going to that airport to fly back to LA

1013
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:06,432
And actually wasn't wearing my shoes I was wearing a pair of running shoes anyways I'm at American Airlines checking in

1014
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
The kiosk and the girl next to me

1015
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
She probably mid-thirties

1016
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
She's wearing red para tops

1017
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
At this point like the only if you ever seen the rain

1018
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Get my parents

1019
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Friends my interns

1020
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Made my neighbor

1021
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,816
You know and I was so excited

1022
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Like cures like

1023
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
Total random person wearing a pair of shoes

1024
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
So you had to talk

1025
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Yeah

1026
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
Ty says we're doing the checking as excuse me I said damn

1027
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
I couldn't help but notice these shoes you're wearing

1028
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
They're really cool what are they

1029
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
And she like

1030
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Ligament stress out there Toms Toms Shoes

1031
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,320
This is like the most amazing comp in the world I might not really tell me about it

1032
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Check when I bought this pair of shoes

1033
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,696
They gave a pair to a child in Argentina

1034
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
And I am right

1035
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,304
And so I said well actually

1036
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
You know

1037
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
MSU Blake II started Tom

1038
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
Dead Silence

1039
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
You know like like

1040
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
She just said

1041
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Can't believe it

1042
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
And then she listens

1043
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
Why did you cut your hair

1044
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,456
And that was our main question in the fighting was why should I cut my hair why she knew I live in about all this stuff was

1045
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Because of

1046
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
At this point now

1047
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,832
You know we're on Facebook and where

1048
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
You know we're promoting on YouTube and

1049
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
She had not

1050
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,976
Just a customer she'd gone online in like learn everything

1051
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
He could have got the business

1052
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
And it just really started to

1053
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Kind of like

1054
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
In my mind

1055
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
I'm up

1056
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
Entrepreneur and mathematical stamp

1057
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Point B a quote

1058
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Vic

1059
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
It's just

1060
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Everyone who bought

1061
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
Pair of TOMS new

1062
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Morris knew that

1063
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
When they were buying a pair

1064
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
You guys would do a parrot

1065
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
A child in need

1066
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
Yeah me and your early days I think that's

1067
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
The primary

1068
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
Driver of why people bought Toms

1069
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
The shoes were

1070
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Frankly not that good a quality

1071
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,488
They didn't last as long as we had hoped they would I mean

1072
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,304
Yeah they were different they were stylish Etc but

1073
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
That the giving was at

1074
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
The huge huge

1075
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Is driver in the early day

1076
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
I mean I'm like a turtle

1077
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Am I

1078
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
3 years behind everybody else

1079
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
And I think the first time I heard about Tom's was

1080
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
In 2009

1081
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
This commercial

1082
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
Yeah what was that about what happened

1083
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
So I

1084
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
It was doing a lot of media about Tom's

1085
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,808
And so I think I was doing a CNN interview

1086
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
And

1087
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
The woman asked me

1088
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:28,512
She said how in the world do you run your business cuz I just got back from Ethiopia on a giving trip

1089
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
And she's like

1090
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,376
Yuan Yuan Ethiopia last week you were in Uno Argentina 3 weeks

1091
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,680
Before that any of this fast-growing business

1092
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
Like how you running this company and

1093
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Being in all these places we are giving out

1094
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,848
Issues and I held up my Blackberry at the time

1095
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Which I had and it's a disc

1096
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
I said I can literally

1097
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Approve designs take orders

1098
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
You know

1099
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Do everything from this

1100
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
And I can do it for me.

1101
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,672
Someone who worked at Bebe d&o at age

1102
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488

And thankfully I did use it

1107

They called me out and they

1108
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
I said okay well we going to talk to you about an idea we have

1109
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Commercial

1110
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
My name is Blake and I'm the chief shoe Giver at Toms shoes they went with us on a real giving trip in Uruguay

1111
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
When you went and handed out

1112
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
Choose when we choose

1113
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
They filmed us in our office

1114
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,952
I need a network with great coverage because for every pair of shoes that we sell

1115
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
Everything was just

1116
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,816
Holy realtoy legit and they made it into

1117
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
A very different type of

1118
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Commercial for AT&T

1119
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
But it just hit a nerve with people

1120
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
That was a turning point

1121
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
What that made that turn Tom's from like

1122
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Kind of this

1123
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Fashion

1124
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
Nice thing to a major

1125
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
Yeah I mean that was a turnip

1126
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
What does now I mean your millions and millions

1127
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Of Americans Elite Four

1128
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,344
Sing our story multiple times throughout the week on different shows and commercials than

1129
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
And that was

1130
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Just driving the business

1131
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
What's in an incredible way

1132
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
And by this point had you

1133
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
I mean I'm assuming you you hired

1134
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
18 to help you

1135
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
Run this

1136
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Growing business

1137
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
That's right cuz you were probably doing

1138
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
Like what kind of Revenue are you doing

1139
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
Every art that point we are I mean we did the first

1140
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Steer

1141
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
And business

1142
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
I want to say we did

1143
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
About

1144
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
300000

1145
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,944
The second year we did about

1146
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
3 million

1147
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
And the third year we did

1148
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Like

1149
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
15 million

1150
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
In the fourth year we went to excel

1151
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
When we went from basically from zero

1152
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
2

1153
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
450 million dollars

1154
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
Sales on an annual basis

1155
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
In like

1156
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
7 years

1157
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
You know I think

1158
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
We can go faster

1159
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Just green shoe company in the world

1160
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Insane

1161
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Yeah it was insane

1162
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
What did you find to be

1163
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,431
The most hardest thing about growing so quickly

1164
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
You know

1165
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
But after that commercial Nephew just started like

1166
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Golang game bus

1167
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Imagine the shoes

1168
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
Making Usher and Ein even I mean even until just

1169
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
How to say recently is the last

1170
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
2 years

1171
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
Making the shoes has always been the hardest part

1172
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
Because none of us were Shoemaker

1173
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
None of us were

1174
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
You know production

1175
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Can people anyways all

1176
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
Just different people I met along the journey that

1177
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
You had a passion

1178
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
Jennifer you know

1179
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
For helping kids and doing something disruptive and having fun in life

1180
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
And so the discipline of being great making shoes is always

1181
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
And something that we've struggled with

1182
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,575
And we really just recently in the last couple years gotten better at

1183
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
I'm wondering about

1184
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,695
Something to happen around 2011/2012

1185
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
You decided to just take a step back from

1186
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
From from the whole companies

1187
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Drop off the map

1188
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
This is Hawaii

1189
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
Well

1190
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
The other business was

1191
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Was becoming

1192
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Pretty

1193
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Corporate

1194
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Pretty kind of bureaucratic we had

1195
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,407
You know what leadership team that we had built that was

1196
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,783
You know maybe not running it the same kind of way that we used to in same passion in

1197
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,111
I didn't feel connected to the mission of TOMS and

1198
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:12,767
That and I was questioning like is it something with the rest of my life or like my other entrepreneur gigs is it time to go and do something different and

1199
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,607
Until I just thought the best thing for me to do which I've always found is when I'm

1200
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Struggling in statistics

1201
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Getaway in

1202
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
Can be alone

1203
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Sometime in

1204
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
And I did that what did you do did you get you just like

1205
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Go take a hike

1206
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,199
Now I'm at the Austin Texas where I originally love often and I just got married and my wife and I

1207
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Side to move to Austin

1208
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Every year

1209
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:37,855
Melissa company became super corporate and you are kind of disillusioned

1210
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
What happened to make you want to

1211
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Return to it

1212
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,511
Ultimately I realized there was more to be done

1213
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
You know like we had bigger

1214
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
Ambitions than what we had accomplished before

1215
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Now I feel like

1216
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,215
We could use our model to help more people with more products

1217
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
I had enough new things

1218
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
The kind of get my energy

1219
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Again

1220
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,663
You know it was just time for me to come back and is really my wife actually she recognized that I was

1221
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Kind of getting into a depressed state and Austin

1222
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,831
And I just realized I was gone that I loved it like I missed it I miss the people I miss

1223
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903
I'm being in it missed the challenges yeah

1224
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
Pressing you refer to Tom's

1225
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
What is a movement

1226
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
Rather than a business obviously

1227
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
You know there's some people are cynical about that

1228
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
That's just Blake

1229
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,959
Use it you know yet he's just using that as a way to

1230
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
Generate more interest

1231
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,847
Is that like is that how you see it a movement rather than a business

1232
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
You know I think I think that

1233
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
The movement part

1234
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
I really felt that

1235
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Where are customers

1236
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
AR

1237
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Rain gauge

1238
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
In the

1239
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
The effect that they're having with

1240
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
And that

1241
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
Maybe buying a pair of TOMS has the

1242
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
The first step or maybe it's

1243
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
The 10th step

1244
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
And their desire to

1245
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
To be more conscious

1246
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Consumers in human

1247
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
And so

1248
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
To me that is more of a movement

1249
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
Have a way of thinking

1250
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
It is a business

1251
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Like you

1252
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
Menu you've read and

1253
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
I know about

1254
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Do you know

1255
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
Over the years people have said look you know

1256
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
This might sound like

1257
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Great business

1258
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Actually * is

1259
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Disrupting markets

1260
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Raisin and

1261
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
Traduction not helping alleviate

1262
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Poverty

1263
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
And you know

1264
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Directions

1265
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
Creating other problem

1266
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
I mean try some of those criticisms

1267
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
AR

1268
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
Aren't there some

1269
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Ameritas

1270
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Damn right

1271
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,775
Yes I mean the first in kind of most

1272
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Prevalent criticism

1273
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,383
Has been like okay if Tom's really want to make a difference in the

1274
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Communities

1275
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
They would not

1276
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,735
Just focus on a dude focus on job creation

1277
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:46,111
And that criticism was really difficult to hear it first because frankly I just didn't know how to

1278
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Address it like I agreed with it

1279
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,999
You know what yes and Theory would be amazing to create a bunch of jobs in Kenya

1280
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
But I mean

1281
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
How in the world am I going to figure that out

1282
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
I like everything else

1283
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,447
But ultimately back in mm

1284
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
I think it was

1285
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
R12x

1286
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
We made a pledge to

1287
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,895
Manufacture as many shoes as we could in the countries that we give in

1288
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,223
And today were manufacturing over 40%

1289
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
I've already giving shoes in country

1290
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Trees like

1291
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,855
Kenya Ethiopia India

1292
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,159
You lots of different places

1293
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
I'm we're also giving

1294
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
So was that was that a direct

1295
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,815
Response to your critics are sort of like saying you know what your right

1296
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
It was it wasn't it was a it was a humbling experience

1297
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:35,519
Experience in one where we had a Express and vulnerability and say okay we don't have to do this. Try it

1298
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
And we start small we scaled asthma

1299
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
Groudon and it's actually been

1300
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,687
You know now it's something that we pride ourselves in is part of our business

1301
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:50,367
Fitbit the idea of the buy one and then we'll give one to somebody need really you know you guys are crazy you are credited

1302
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
Really starting to smiley

1303
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,255
Probably weren't the first they were probably other companies out there doing this but

1304
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,863
You know you did this on a very big scale and since then a lots and lots and lots

1305
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Companies

1306
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,679
Have follow that model Warby Parker

1307
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
And it's been good for business

1308
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Sleeping really

1309
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Really good

1310
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
Yeah I mean I think of all the things we're most proud of

1311
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
Diatoms is like the Legacy that we

1312
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,503
You created in in this model has become

1313
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Not just

1314
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Irrelevant model of Toms but with lots

1315
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
The companies around the world and it's encouraged even companies

1316
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
To be on the one for model

1317
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
To incorporate giving more into their actual business

1318
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Business model not just

1319
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
A check that they write at the end of the year you know

1320
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
To a non-profit

1321
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
I think about like

1322
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
The Arc of your

1323
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Curry rice

1324
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
I mean

1325
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
The laundry business for

1326
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
College students and the

1327
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Outdoor advertising company in

1328
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,175
Reality TV channel Anthony

1329
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,711
TN driver's ed

1330
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
School

1331
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,783
I mean very different from what

1332
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
Did you get with X write like

1333
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Very very different

1334
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,183
Do you think that you could have done Tom's without

1335
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Without doing all those

1336
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Biggest companies

1337
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
I don't think

1338
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
Tom's would you wear this today if I hadn't had the

1339
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
Experiences

1340
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:11,263
The thinking behind Tom's was always there but it was always something that was more in an order of

1341
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Make money first

1342
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
Help others second

1343
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,663
Because that's how every other business person I've ever known

1344
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
No I never

1345
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
Headed rat about anyone that was

1346
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
Helping people as they were building the biz

1347
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,855
And I think that Tom's is

1348
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
Is like my soulmate Abyss

1349
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Slenderman is like

1350
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
I get to be

1351
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Be creative

1352
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Get to find meaning in that

1353
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
You know I I I

1354
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Recognize it

1355
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Amount of wealth

1356
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
But now my wife and I were responsible for was

1357
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,703
Far more than we would ever

1358
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Men think about

1359
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
Spending In Our Lifetime

1360
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
And so we made a real conscious

1361
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Decision to take half of it

1362
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,407
And in committed to investing in social entrepreneurs

1363
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,455
That's a big part of my life now is

1364
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
Actually investing in the Next Generation

1365
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
As a way to solve problems

1366
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
That that we are faced

1367
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
Denso

1368
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
That's been

1369
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
A huge blessing and all this is well-liked mycoskie founder of Toms

1370
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,935
Shoes by the way Tom's is giving away more than 70 million shoes in 70 countries around the world

1371
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Back in 2014 Blake

1372
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,055
Sold half the company to a private Equity Group

1373
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,639
Up until then Tom's had never had a single investor

1374
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Do people call you Tom

1375
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
All the time

1376
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:27,551
Would you ever say if you say yeah

1377
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
People say hey Tom at the airport I'd turn around because if it said hey Blake cuz I know that talking to himself

1393
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
2017 about

1394
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,919
Gamers gift is a nonprofit co-founded by Dylan Hill when he was a student

1395
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,319
At UC Davis so our biggest thing right now is bringing virtual reality the headsets to

1396
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Children's Hospital

1397
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Assisted living facilities

1398
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
And people with disabilities goes all the way back

1399
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,583
To the fifth grade when Dillon's best friend Chris

1400
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,679
Was diagnosed with cancer and had to spend months in the hospital

1401
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:53,567
I would visit him every single day and what I saw was my friend was no longer the kid that I knew

1402
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
And my solution was to bring the video games because I knew that those would make him smile Chris eventually did

1403
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,623
Get better and stay friends and that experience always stuck with me and I remember looking back on it at

1404
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,439
Well those video games really helped us

1405
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,975
Sunnyway fast forward

1406
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
To senior year in high school

1407
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,607
And Dylan is now doing volunteer work in his spare time

1408
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
But he's not all that happy with it

1409
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
I volunteered at a food shelter

1410
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,239
And instead of spending time with the homeless

1411
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
I was in the back

1412
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Packing bags

1413
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
And then obviously all these things they help

1414
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
But it would just wasn't rewarding

1415
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,967
Dylan kept thinking about the video games maybe

1416
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
There was some way he could use them to tell people

1417
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,135
Chris we're doing a little random Googling

1418
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,791
And Dylan said hey I wonder what it would take to start our own charity and we googled how to start a non-profit

1419
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Get to me song

1420
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
Wow this is simplified into 6

1421
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Steps

1422
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
First make an LLC

1423
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
And then get in touch with the franchise tax

1424
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Bored

1425
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
Actually some of the stuff Justin hot

1426
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Sounds so simple but

1427
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Eventually Dylan got his mom

1428
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,663
To guarantee a blanket

1429
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,503
For their nonprofit and they became a 501 c 3

1430
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,087
I think we probably Google every single line on the tax paperwork

1431
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
Because we had no idea what a lot of it meant but

1432
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
I mean we have the internet you know we can figure out anything

1433
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
Cancel after they got it sorted out Dylan and Chris started to raise money to buy video games and VR head

1434
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Headset

1435
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,191
First they sold baked goods door-to-door

1436
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:30,591
Finna get some donations through an online service they were starting to visit hospitals and other places in

1437
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,407
In California sharing VR and games with

1438
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
Children and adults

1439
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:39,039
So for example there was this man Dominic who's living with cerebral palsy

1440
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
And he's always wanted to drive a race

1441
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
He's only able to communicate by moving his head up or down but we can put a headset on him and we can pushes is real

1442
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,583
Wheelchair around his living room and we can emulate

1443
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
Him driving a Formula 1 race car

1444
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
Let's still in Hill

1445
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
Who co-founded Gamers gift

1446
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,543
Along with his friend Chris Betancourt

1447
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,591
A lot has happened

1448
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
First right

1449
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
That story

1450
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,735
Chris is Leukemia returned in October of 2017

1451
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
And his prognosis

1452
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Was not good

1453
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
Took Chris came up with a bucket list

1454
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,415
Things he wanted to do before he died

1455
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,463
And Dylan wanted to help

1456
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
On that list

1457
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Beat a world record

1458
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,351
Chris and Dylan wanted to register the most

1459
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Bone marrow donors in one day

1460
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
The world record was 2976 to social media

1461
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,663
And they got 3715 people to register

1462
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,039
And they got something else something they didn't really expect a match for Chris

1463
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:49,695
2 months later Chris had a bone marrow transplant and today he's cancer-free

1464
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,791
