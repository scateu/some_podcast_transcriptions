1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
So back in the 1980s

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:05,376
Rod canion left Texas Instruments with One Vision

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,192
To create a better portable computer

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
He had no idea he

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
28-pound invention

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,848
Would not only compete but also beat out

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
Computing Giant

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
IBM

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
We first ran this episode

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,248
May of 2017 and there is a lot

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Of great stuff in here

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Enjoy

13
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Well they take over and push everybody out

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
In February of 1984 IBM introduces their own portable into the

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
Our order stopped because before it actually was introduced they were showing it to

16
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
The dealers and customers in they just stopped arguing ours that was that was a very very life threat

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,784
We have this Factory running full speed and no place to go

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,184
From NPR how I built this

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists the stories behind the movement

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
They show a personal computer startup compact Sig on the biggest computer company in

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
The world and one

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
If you have a PC at home or at work and

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
Some software like

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Word or TurboTax

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,888
It doesn't really matter if you have a Dell or an HP or Toshiba because if it's a PC

26
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,984
It will run PC software and that makes perfect sense right

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,336
Believe it or not in the 1980s in the early days of personal computers

28
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
That is not how it works

29
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
If your computer was say in IBM

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,552
Well you needed software written for and IBM

31
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
And IBM was the biggest

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Player

33
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Star

34
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Some people thought that IBM would eventually Crush all the competition and become the only

35
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,656
PC maker

36
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Wasn't your typical Restless entrepreneurial guy infected he had a good and stable job at 10

37
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,408
Instruments as an electrical engineer and he was pretty happy there

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
One day in 1981 his managers assigned him to work on a new project and it was something

39
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
Believe would not work

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
And he started to get frustrated

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,536
Basically was being told to go spend the next two years of my life being my head against the wall

42
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
And end up in failure

43
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
So at the moment

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,008
Rod started to talk to to close colleagues at Texas Instruments Jim Harris and Bill mirto and

45
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
Basically said maybe we should leave

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
We met

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
And talked about how we're going to go start a company

48
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,504
And there a lot of startup companies in California in Silicon Valley

49
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,648
One of the first things we realize is she these guys are having fun they're making a ton of money in

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
They're not any smarter than we are they just

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
They're just out doing it themselves

52
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
There's also this awareness that something really big is going on in that personal computer Market when I be

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
Diameter the market in August of 1981

54
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
We realized that

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
That market

56
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
It was going to explode

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
And then what happened is fall comdex came along

58
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
We went out to the

59
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,064
Conference since all of the companies and all of the things going on it which is

60
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
That did it we went back to Houston and talked about

61
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
We're going to miss this if we don't get going so

62
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
Jim Harrison I turn in a resignation

63
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Right away

64
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Amaretto

65
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Waited because

66
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
His wife was about to deliver their first child

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
And you have family to write

68
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
How many kids did you have

69
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
3

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,896
What are you nervous at all about just quitting without any income coming in I mean

71
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Were you worried at all by doing that

72
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
You know I don't remember being worried about it

73
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,136
The three of us none of us had any money to invest so what we did was we saved up

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Money and the idea was

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
We'll give ourselves a runway length

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Civ 6 months

77
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
Come up with an idea and go get funding

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
And I think

79
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
This is an adventure

80
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Let's go see what we can do

81
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
So so what did the three of you serve land on the idea that

82
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Eventually turned into combat

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
Well the the idea came to me

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
Actually one morning

85
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
Strange how you remember those pivotal point in your life but

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
I was thinking about the idea for a portable computer there were

87
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
A number of them that existed at the time

88
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Probably

89
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Just guess

90
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
15 or 20

91
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Well most people

92
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Remember the Osborn

93
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
It was made out of

94
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Cheap molding and sort of

95
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Strung together

96
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
It had a 5 inch diameter screen

97
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
I had two floppies but you could have mediately see some ways to make it a lot better in a week we decided we could do a 9-inch

98
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Screen in about the same size box

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,647
Well that seems small turns out it's about the same size is

100
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
What the

101
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Original iPad screen is

102
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
And we could make it rugged so that when you carried it it was

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Not damaged

104
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
But

105
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
Not worth really spending the time on unless we could get some software that already existed

106
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Because

107
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
I had learned that the key software like spreadsheets and word processors in and others

108
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,087
Every different brand of computer had to have its own version of the popular software program

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
So I said well what if we could make

110
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
This great portable run software that already exists

111
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
I knew that the IBM PC

112
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
Was relatively unprotected it would be a

113
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
A challenge but it could be reverse-engineered

114
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Legally

115
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
And we could make our computer

116
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Run the same software

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
And that was the idea that the send a chill down my spine wow

118
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759
What's wrong with this idea there's there's got to be something wrong with it it's too good to be just hanging around here

119
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,855
At what point did you say okay we have an idea let's go look for money

120
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
So I called up Jim Harris and then later got bilmar to involved and we

121
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,327
Thought about it talked about it and decided you know that that would be a great product if we can do that

122
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,679
Let's put together the business plan and so that was the next thing we did I mean

123
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
It was very quick from the 9th of January

124
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,871
To when the idea came up to the 22nd of January when we met with the venture capital

125
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
We basically

126
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,039
Put together I am a very short for page business plan and prepare to meet and discuss it

127
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,111
And what did they say when they die

128
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Well

129
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,207
They were coming into town for another meeting and we

130
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
But this business plan in front of a man

131
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Begin to describe it

132
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
And

133
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Then they started

134
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,215
Talking to each other either one of them said yeah I had this idea you know like three months ago

135
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
And I said well

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
If you think it's such a good idea why aren't you more excited about it and I said well

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Look

138
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
We like the idea we like you guys

139
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
But we're new in this

140
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Industry

141
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,599
So what you need to do is we need to send you out to Silicon Valley and go meet with Kleiner Perkins

142
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Enough

143
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
They are the best then we will

144
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
So we

145
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
We basically flew out to

146
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
To Silicon Valley and we went in to meet with

147
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
With Jon Dore

148
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
And we spent a good morning probably 3 or 4 hours

149
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Being

150
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Question

151
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And

152
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Turn off

153
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
About a week later

154
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
We got a call that they were willing to invest and

155
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
So

156
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
It was a go

157
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,391
Okay so it's 1982 I guess and and you've gotten your investors and in what you do

158
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Get to work building a prototype

159
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Well the first thing we do is

160
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Begin hiring people

161
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
How's the three of us

162
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
We're sort of

163
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
The head of each area but we need

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Engineers mainly to go figure out how to reverse engineer in huh

165
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
Designer things how so we hired three engineers

166
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
And importantly they basically had to build something

167
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
Pretty similar to tune IBM PC

168
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,295
Except pretty similar didn't cut it and you had to be exactly the same in order to run the software

169
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
From an internal temp

170
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
And so they are

171
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
They came to Workforce right away

172
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
And again

173
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
First reverse engineering product

174
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
And then designing our own

175
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
But were you convinced that you guys were going to succeed

176
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
You know it never crossed my mind that we wouldn't

177
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
Succeed and as I look back now I think

178
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Well that was such a long shot

179
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
You know our expectations were very low

180
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,015
What is exceed mean if it didn't mean become the industry leader it didn't even mean become one of the leading couple

181
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
Is it may build a company that doesn't go out of business

182
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
That has a product

183
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
That salsa a real need

184
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
And

185
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
You don't lose money on

186
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
We felt like we know how to do that

187
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
How long does it take

188
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
For you from that point in

189
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
I guess the first or the other early part of

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Me too

191
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Until you had a working prototype

192
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
So we

193
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Start the company February 16th

194
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
And from March

195
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Until

196
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Early June

197
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
We had our first prototype ready

198
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
The deadline was determined by the national computer conference

199
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,487
What you just happened to be held in Houston that you're the only time I think it was over in Houston

200
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
To show to

201
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Potential dealers

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Digital computer store owners who would sell it

203
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Tube magazine

204
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Writers who would write about it when it came out

205
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
An app to get feedback

206
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,615
And others basically to find out what people thought about this product

207
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
So you come up with this prototype

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
And at that point

209
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Where are you even manufacturing these

210
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
These computers

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
We built

212
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Factory

213
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Inside a leased building

214
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
North Houston

215
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
We heard manufacturing people Lake

216
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,095
Put up reproduction Lionheart people trying them on how to build it and

217
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Began to build

218
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
The product

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
And we had a plan

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,751
That basically allowed us to build

221
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Probably I'm going to say 20 25000

222
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Computers

223
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
By the end of 83 we didn't begin actually turning out

224
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Finished units until January of 80

225
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,831
Just to be clear when you talk about a portable computer in 1980

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
3

227
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
You're talking about a

228
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
A machine that way

229
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
What's the way

230
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
28 lb

231
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
This is not even hand luggage on an airplane

232
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
Well we did use it as hand luggage but

233
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Skepticism about that

234
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,495
Nelly that you had to plug in Ethernet

235
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
People began to call them

236
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
Transportable computers which is more accurate

237
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
It was also very rugged

238
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
One of our key engineering talents

239
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
What's the building

240
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
So that it

241
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
When you dropped it

242
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Survive

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
And of course your portable would run any software

244
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
Written for deeply IBM

245
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
And another competition did that right

246
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
That's right

247
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
And basically

248
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
Laid in 82 as we had our first prototypes

249
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,471
Bill murto and then I joining because there were a lot of computer stores around the country

250
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
We would go out and make an appointment and go in and and show

251
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
The computer store on our product

252
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
And

253
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
Show them the computer they like the way it looked and when we

254
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
Show them how it works it was very nice

255
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Screen was nice

256
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
But when we told him okay just pick up any of the IBM

257
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Software

258
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
Off-the-shelf tennis shrink wrap box

259
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,839
And put it in the computer and see if it runs and when they did that and it ran

260
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Their eyes

261
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Lit up

262
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,727
They got excited I thought about it a minute and they wanted to order some right there

263
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Let me say something like okay I need five of these next week or I've got it I'll give you an order for 25 if you can ship them

264
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
In the next month

265
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
Bill and I got back to Houston and compare notes

266
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
It was like women every one of these theater said the same thing

267
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
What we just stumbled onto is this

268
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Pent-up demand

269
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
For portable version of the IBM PC

270
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
It seems solid but we've never thought of our product that way

271
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
This is a portable computer if it's a niche

272
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
And you have software because it runs all the IBM software

273
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
But if you just step back and turn that over and say

274
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Everybody out there has an IBM PC in their office

275
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,687
And what they need every one of them needs one or more of is

276
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
A portable version of it

277
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
And we happen to have that product

278
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
People were wanting to take

279
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
Leasing home for the weekend or even overnight 2

280
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
To finish their work they wanted to take them out to customers

281
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
The show them

282
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Their work and soul

283
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
It was a much bigger

284
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
Market than anybody anticipated wants

285
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
We had all the ingredients together

286
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Weren't weren't you worried in 1982 when you are going to dealers and showing them your product that

287
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
And saying hey you know this is basically

288
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
This could do everything and IBM could do

289
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Except

290
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
It's portable World War shoot you guys worried that IBM would come after you

291
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
No because we hadn't broken any laws

292
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
Yeah we did reverse-engineer the wrong following

293
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,535
Advice from top-notch intellectual property lawyer so we were very careful around that

294
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
The product was not

295
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,167
Protected by patents and any other way they unfollowed more or less

296
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
The General Industry Direction and so

297
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Building a computer that was

298
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
Similar or close to it was not a problem at all the fact that we

299
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Took the time to figure out exactly how there's made the software work

300
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
And made ours do the same thing it was not illegal

301
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,439
It sounds like you guys really launched this in a stealth way that IBM probably didn't even

302
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,535
Care about you thought you were just probably just above a flyspeck of a company

303
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,143
That was making this product and when you launched it in 1983

304
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
I don't even

305
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Even know who you were

306
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
Oh no no they had no idea and nor did they care I mean even after we began to the store to get some positive

307
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
Results and getting into stores remember we were portable they didn't have a portal so initially

308
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
Play it was very easy for them to ignore us because we were truly

309
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,255
Fly

310
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
In that first year 1983

311
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,959
How did the company do we sold 111 million dollars worth of Compaq computers

312
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Wow

313
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,151
Expanding like crazy at the beginning of that year you just had

314
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,479
A few hundred maybe like blasting a hundred people working there

315
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
We had about

316
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
About a hundred people at the end of the fur

317
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
It's about right and about 600 by the end of 83 so you can imagine

318
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
How much hiring we were doing

319
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
And expanding and

320
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
Now this was not a one thing at a time this is multitasking

321
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
Bringing on very competent people in every area so they could

322
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Here's what needs to be done and go get it

323
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
How how much were you selling that

324
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
First portable computer for

325
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
It was it listed for 2995 for a single floppy

326
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Unbelievable

327
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,087
And who your customers was it businesses was it individuals

328
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
It was mostly businesses

329
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
But

330
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
A surprising number of individuals

331
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Could see the value in it

332
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
And if their company wasn't buying it for them then they would do

333
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
They would buy it for themselves

334
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
Thousand bucks for this computer in tens of thousands

335
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
This point

336
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
IBM is starting to notice

337
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Oh absolutely

338
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Absolutely

339
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Hey

340
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
You know in February of 1984 IBM introduces their own portable into the market now

341
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,855
Our order stop because before it actually was introduced

342
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
They were showing it to dealers and customers head

343
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
They just stopped ordering hours

344
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,815
Market they take over and push everybody out

345
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
So we had his Factory running full speed

346
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
And no place to go

347
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
That was that was a

348
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Very

349
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Very life-threatening

350
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
So you guys are freaking out

351
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,175
We're freaking out the industry speaking out it's like they're ghost compact you know they're there

352
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
They had a good run but it's over when we come

353
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,487
I'm back at ride Canyon made sure that it wasn't yet over stay with this guy Raz

354
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
How I built this

355
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,631

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

386
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Gyros

387
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,271
Really good first year of sales for Rod Canyon and come back

388
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
But to put it in perspective

389
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Compact sold about

390
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
53000 computers

391
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
And that same year

392
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
IBM

393
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
They sold

394
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
750000

395
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Computers

396
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
And so in 1984 when IBM decided

397
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Compete with compact Head to Head

398
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
Everyone knew it was a major threat

399
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
So tried call together the management team for an emergency meeting

400
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,199
You know what do we think we ought to do well the manufacturing of people said

401
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
We got a lot of temporary people

402
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
We were hiring so fast they came on as Temporaries initially in

403
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,415
And we can lay all them off immediately and we can really cut back production

404
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Cut backer cost

405
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
And it was It was a

406
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
I have to say a very dire

407
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Down to the meeting everybody was like you know it's all over

408
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Took all that in and

409
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
Add it all up and I realized

410
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
You know if we're going to come out of this

411
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
With a happy ending

412
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
There's only one way that's going to occur and that is

413
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
Let's assume for a minute that IBM's product is not better than ours

414
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
That maybe it's a limited

415
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
Supply and the Dealer's once they see it

416
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Begin to order our product again

417
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
We need to have product available to fill those orders

418
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
So

419
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,095
Here's what we're going to do we're going to keep building these things were going to store them and wait for the artist to come

420
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
At the August never come

421
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
Yeah we're in deep trouble but you know what we're in deep trouble anyway if they order

422
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
That was the plan

423
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
I'm not sure everybody was

424
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
I'm bored with it but that's what we went off and did

425
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
Winner of storing these things in the in the trailers

426
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
Tractor trailers 18-wheelers back

427
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Yeah and parking them in our garage

428
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Parking lot

429
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
When that failed up

430
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Borrowed space and Friends parking lots around the the town and Buy Mid

431
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,119
February we had about 20 of these trailers full of computer sitting around Houston

432
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
So what happened how did you survive

433
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Well

434
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
What happened is IBM introduces the product

435
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
The kick the tires

436
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
It's announced that it is unlimited

437
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Supply for a while

438
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,479
It was not a better product when the bad product it just wasn't better

439
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
And so just as we had hoped almost the best possible situation is the orders came in and we had the computer stuff

440
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
It's like they had been holding them back and so not only were they arguing isn't normal right they were sending all the orders that they had been holding

441
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,423
Everything fell into place just at the right time and then we took advantage of

442
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
So what explains

443
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,799
What explains the fact that they didn't Crush you

444
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
I mean it it sounds to me like it was one of

445
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Two things it was either

446
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Total luck

447
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,271
Or it was that the IBM portable computer just wasn't that good or maybe

448
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Both

449
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Well anyway you look at it

450
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Good luck I mean

451
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
It was a lot of luck involved but what happened is

452
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
We have had a year

453
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
To build great relationships

454
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
With the dealers

455
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
The dealers actually liked having somebody

456
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Other than IBM

457
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Because I be almost the

458
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Get on the 500 pound gorilla

459
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Then I knew it

460
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
In any case

461
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,615
We continue to sell like crazy and outsold the IBM portable

462
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Throughout the year I think by the end of the year we were out selling it

463
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
7 or 8 to 1

464
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Edgar 84

465
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
By the end of 84

466
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
And

467
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,903
We tripled to 329 million in our second

468
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
So by your second year you

469
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Tripled

470
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Sales

471
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
What was the first time you remember

472
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,680
Compact becoming part of lyca of the mainstream conversation in america

473
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Well

474
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Depends on

475
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:36,640
How big do mainstream is I think by the end of 83 everybody in the industry knew about Compact and we'll sort of

476
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
Marveling at what was going on here

477
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
You know this idea that

478
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
People can use all the same for referrals

479
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,928
All the same things that were designed and built to run in the IBM PC with it with software or Hardware would work on our computer

480
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:54,048
IBM may be underestimated as they didn't really study what it made our products

481
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,400
Successful they could have easily put us out of business if they come out with a a real comprable product

482
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,472
Yeah and it wasn't once you guys show that you

483
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Could build an IBM clone

484
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,616
A lot of other companies realized it was possible to do the same thing right

485
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
That's right

486
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
And the fact that we took off and set sales records main everybody else

487
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Did including by the way the

488
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
The big guys h p t i

489
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Deck all

490
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
Violate followed suit but by then we had

491
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,744
Really establish ourselves in the market in

492
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
You know the thing that

493
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Tookus

494
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
From 600 million and 80

495
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,424
6 to 1.2 billion in sales in 87

496
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
We came out with our own desktop which was essentially three times faster than IBM's desktop for about the same price and

497
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Begin to establish

498
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Ourselves is not only the portable company

499
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
But also the high-performance company

500
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
IBM try to kill off all the Clones when when they released the PS2 in in 1887

501
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
Was designed so it could not be cloned right

502
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Yeah

503
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
That's right

504
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
That was an attempt

505
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,192
To take this thing that has gotten out of control mainly due to Compaq

506
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
And bring it back under IBM's control

507
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,640
So IBM comes out with their new architecture and claims that this is the way to go

508
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
That that all architecture has run its course

509
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,576
It's going to run out of gas very soon and so you don't want to follow it to the end you want to get on this new horse

510
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
And IBM has it

511
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
And so let's go

512
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
And

513
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
That's where IBM's

514
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Marketing

515
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Strategy got them in trouble

516
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Because

517
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
This thing not only didn't run all the software it didn't run any of the softer

518
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,800
IBM's new computer did not run IBM's own software

519
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
It didn't

520
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Now they came out with new IBM soft

521
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
So if you wanted to buy this new product

522
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Youku

523
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
Buy all new peripherals and all new software

524
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
And they would claim that it would outperform anything else in the market

525
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
So at the time the right and you're saying that

526
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,768
Emily companies many companies already had

527
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
PCS and software IBM was saying

528
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,704
Buy the Snoopy s2o and you're also going to have to invest in new software

529
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
You make it sound crazy I told them it was normal that's the way the industry had always worked and they they still hadn't bought into this industry

530
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Standard idea

531
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
People

532
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Believing that

533
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,016
An understanding that it was important to be able to run

534
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Your old software on a new computer

535
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
It never happened before

536
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Compact Pioneer MN

537
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
They wanted to get rid of it as quick as they could

538
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,560
Was there a moment where you were worried that that actually would succeed

539
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Oh yeah

540
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Never

541
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Question

542
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
They had a good chance

543
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
To succeed now what kept us going and what

544
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
I guess gave us

545
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,104
Confidence that we had a pretty good chance was

546
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
We outperformed to IBM's best products

547
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
Every step of the way

548
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,320
Until there was a significant part of the industry that looked at the IBM's claims

549
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Little magazines

550
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
Afraid to write

551
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Compaq outperformed cibm by

552
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
50 to 100%

553
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,376
In spite of it being a BM we were holding onto a pretty

554
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Solid position in the market

555
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Because

556
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
Ours was always higher-performing

557
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
It seems like

558
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
At any juncture

559
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
In your first several years

560
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,944
IBM have they just done

561
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
Something a little bit smarter strategically

562
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
Could have crushed you

563
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
There's no doubt IBM could have crushed us a number of different ways

564
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
And at that point in time

565
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
I can ride so it's it's

566
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:43,168
5 Years From the time you launched to to the time you're doing a billion dollars and Randy Wright

567
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
That's right

568
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,312
How to change your life your own personal life changes all of a sudden you like

569
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
I'm assuming you're you become, rich guy

570
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,272
Yeah it'll certainly compared to where I had been I was rich but then again we

571
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
We knew that that was a

572
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
A fragile part of it

573
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,440
I did get a divorce in 1980

574
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
7

575
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
I know it was

576
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Sad part of of what happens in the

577
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
The net Arabic

578
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
I'm sure it had something to do with it

579
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
The stress associated with

580
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
All the work

581
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
The time I spent at work

582
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
So in 1987

583
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Going through divorce

584
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
A simple divorce is hard

585
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
And then IBM comes out with his new computer designed to basically

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Put you guys out of business

587
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
How did you deal with it how did you cope with all that happening

588
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
You looking back on it I would say it's probably denial

589
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
Yeah it's pretty effective tools

590
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Not letting things

591
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
Impact you as much as they might in and sort of other situations is

592
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Something

593
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
You have to do there I mean

594
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
I felt like I was

595
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
Learning as I went and I was doing a good job

596
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
There was personal turmoil

597
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,944
If you want to throw up another layer on top of that

598
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
RadioShack tried to buy us in late 86 in early 87

599
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
So that was going on at

600
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
Same time all this was half

601
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
So you were just

602
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
Should your personal life you were just kind of

603
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
You compartmentalize that you were you just had to

604
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Put that in a box

605
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
Focus on the stuff

606
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
And not let that

607
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Depress you

608
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Yeah no

609
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,312
I've got three kids and they're getting to be

610
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Teenagers in

611
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,152
There's little league and there's all of that in and I'm

612
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,248
Trying very hard to get away at the right time you'll see a school play

613
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
That's where most of the stress came from trying to do it all

614
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,184
If you can just cut off part of it and say I'm not going to worry about that it would be one thing

615
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,024
But trying to do it all in and not drop any balls

616
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
That was pretty stressful

617
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Where you going home

618
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,984
Leo eating like takeout Chinese food I mean done with your day

619
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Crashing usually yell no I

620
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
See pictures now

621
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Of media

622
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,224
During a fast food minimum McDonald's bag or a Wendy's bag

623
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,552
How you just ate when you cut that was sort of secondary

624
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
Getting everybody

625
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
You taking care of getting the meetings done getting

626
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Decisions made

627
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
You can look at my role as making decisions

628
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah I was making all the decisions but all of the cute ones I had to be involved

629
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
And they're always a lot

630
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
I guess about

631
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
Sleep what ten years after you guys lunch compact

632
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
You drafted to the board of directors

633
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
Did they fire you

634
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Almost exactly 10 years later

635
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Why what was going on

636
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Well

637
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
There's several levels of

638
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,672
Looking at the Dynamics there that on the surface it's a matter of disagreement over how fast

639
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
2

640
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Move into the lower-cost arena

641
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Like-like lower-cost PCS

642
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Yes

643
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,912
The chairman of the company Ben Rosen

644
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
Thought we ought to move very quickly and so quickly that went back we got to go buy a product from

645
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
The Taiwanese or Japanese or

646
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Korean

647
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Supplier

648
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
And my argument was looked It's Not What It Seems

649
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
We can get the market as fast as

650
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Anybody

651
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
With our own design

652
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
And I think at the board meeting

653
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
The board decided to replace me with the number two guy with x

654
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Pfeiffer

655
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Patachou

656
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
How'd you get that news

657
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Well we had a board meeting were

658
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,192
Been proposed that idea and I left the room and they

659
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,032
Deliberated it for quite a while and then made the decision to make

660
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
The change

661
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,128
But it was clear that was the direction they were going on I knew that's what it

662
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
I was going to be

663
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
I was also somewhat burnout and I was

664
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Strange mindset

665
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
I kind of wanted to get out of that that pressure it was

666
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
It took me a while to really look back and understand that I was

667
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,048
A big part of the problem of why it ended up going down that path and I and I regret that

668
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,400
But it is what it happened and I guess under the stress I was under and kind of

669
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,472
Gotten into this Frame of Mind where I need to get away

670
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
The

671
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Disagreement over the low cost

672
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Speed to Market

673
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Was just the catalyst

674
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Allowed it to happen

675
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Almost

676
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Guided it to the point where I

677
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
It's going to be far

678
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
So when you were at me this is the company that you found it

679
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
That you built

680
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Yes

681
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
And then you were

682
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,560
Removed from that, I think a lot of people hearing that would say God that sounds like such an injustice

683
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
Cuz it's your idea

684
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,704
You created it it was your sweat and then it was taken away from you

685
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,032
Brazil from your perspective

686
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
That was fine you you weren't kind of

687
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
Your time

688
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
What's over there

689
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Helsby clear

690
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Where are you

691
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
Fortune 500

692
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Corporation

693
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
In a world leader in a big industry

694
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,696
And just because you started the company doesn't give you any right

695
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
To continue to run the company

696
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
Are the dates to be run by somebody that can make

697
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Good decisions and can manage

698
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
That complex in operation

699
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
Which I think I was doing

700
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
Okay or maybe even

701
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Very well up to that point

702
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
What time so that's

703
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
I don't see that as the reason

704
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
That I needed to leave I think it had more to do with

705
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
My friend of mine and sort of a burned-out

706
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Situation

707
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
You were in your mid-forties at that point

708
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Soap so pretty

709
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Pretty young guy

710
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Accomplished a lot

711
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,256
Did you walk out of the company with

712
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Fino financially secure for you

713
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
Set for life of that one

714
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
Yes absolutely

715
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
No course

716
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Continue my life

717
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,776
Actually the whole life became a much less stressful and

718
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,176
Then I got involved in investing in and some startups and early-stage companies and try to help them succeed

719
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Not all of them dead

720
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
But then

721
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
If I leave all to wear I really just like helping entrepreneur start their company in

722
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
Try to help them avoid a lot of mistakes

723
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Do companies make

724
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,816
Compaq it was such a Powerhouse in the 80s

725
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
Is a Fortune 500 company

726
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
Does billion dollars in Revenue within 5 years

727
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,800
And then you think about all of the companies that that it was associated with her that way

728
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Competed against

729
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Do you know

730
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
Apple IBM

731
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Dell

732
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Microsoft

733
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Texas

734
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,088
All of those companies still exist

735
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
And compact doesn't

736
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Existing Wireless

737
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Folded into HP in

738
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
That brand is no longer

739
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Here

740
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
In anyway is that a cautionary tale for some of these powerhouses we see today like Snapchat or Uber

741
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,752
Or Facebook I can't even imagine not existing

742
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,872
You know it really is that's certainly something I

743
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,712
Didn't Envision when I left I guess I just wasn't thinking that far down the road

744
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Yeah of course you never know the future

745
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,368
The decision to merge with HP was a financial decision

746
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:05,024
But the end result of the way it happened is it compact no longer exists and that is sad because

747
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
It's got such a great

748
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,168
History and played such a key role in actually forming the way the world works

749
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
And yet

750
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
Most people you run into on the street

751
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
I've never heard of

752
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Calpak

753
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Crazy annie's

754
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
It is crazy yes it's sad but

755
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
It's also life

756
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
If you know that's that's a

757
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
We started out to build a company that would last

758
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
And I think that's the case with ain't going to feel like

759
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
Dell or Microsoft

760
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Apple

761
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,512
The leaders of those companies maintain enough control

762
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
To make sure that

763
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
It never

764
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
Got into the hands of somebody that looked at it just

765
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
Purely from a financial standpoint

766
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
If I had been there

767
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
If I'd been leaving the company

768
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
We would never have sold

769
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
We would have

770
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Figured out a way to

771
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
To solve the problem

772
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,808
How much of your of your success at compact was because of

773
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,416
Just your hard work and and and smarts and the hard work of Jim and Bill or

774
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
And how much would a wizard

775
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Good luck

776
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
If you would ask me that in

777
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
The 80s

778
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Play the ladies

779
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
I would probably have said it was

780
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
90%

781
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Intelligence

782
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
And inside and

783
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Work

784
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
And 10% luck

785
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,248
But to tell you how perspective changes with time I would say today it was the other way around

786
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,088
We did a lot of good things we came up with a good idea

787
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,928
But if you look back at any of the things that could have gone wrong

788
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
And what if

789
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Either slows down or stopped us

790
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
I mean there's an endless list of those

791
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
So the fact that

792
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,472
Yeah okay we dealt with those issues as they came along but the fact that there was a successful path even available

793
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264
Is pretty

794
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,664
Pretty doggone lucky rad Canyon founded Compaq computers

795
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
With Phil mirto and Jim Harris in 1982

796
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:06,112
Brad still lives in Houston where he mainly invests in other people startups

797
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
The story of compact David and Goliath struggle against IBM was the subject of a very

798
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
Cool documentary

799
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192

813
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

814
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:16,000
Time now for how you built that and today we're updating a story we ran about a year ago my name is Dan

815
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Nicolazzi I live in Germantown Wisconsin and about 16 years ago in college

816
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,800
She love to knit scarves for her friends to the point where they start

817
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
Search Kpop Ranch out of a hat made it and I finished

818
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
I said I thought and it looked at it and there was a

819
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:44,160
Big weird hole in it and I thought I made a mistake I tossed It On The Ground really disappointed

820
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
Good thing that when she did that her dad happened to be in the room my dad selling there

821
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,192
Are you sad will put you through that

822
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Curly massive hair on top of Danica's head so just for fun she put her hair through the hole in the house

823
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
I don't know who said it but remember kind of a collaboratively the room looking

824
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
That looks good

825
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,624
So Danica started to wear the hat with her ponytail

826
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Bump sticking out of it wherever she went on campus are traveling around the country people would say the same

827
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Main thing

828
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,632
Where to get your hat I like your hat without realizing it

829
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,472
Danica had solved a problem for people with long hair because

830
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,568
If you got a ponytail it's uncomfortable to pull a knit hat over it

831
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
Anakin what kind of silly to you know this weird bulge on top of your head so after Danica got out of car

832
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,552
And after she got a full-time job in the chemical industry

833
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
She continued to knit hats with the Spurs

834
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
Strategically placed holes in them

835
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
And then she would sell them online

836
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Where I

837
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
Thought that it might

838
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Stay where I was keeping a job

839
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,448
Forever and ever and I was actually kind of thing going back and getting PhD in

840
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Chemistry

841
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,568
That's not what happened like I get to work and I think

842
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
I could maybe be making

843
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
Just about you know what I'm making here if I made more hat and right around this time

844
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,160
To notice there was competition other people were making hats for ponytails

845
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
Sochi innovated

846
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
She made multiple opening

847
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
To accommodate different hairdos

848
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
And she even figured out how to hide those openings so you could wear the hat like any other hat when he wanted to

849
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,056
And all the knitting took a lot of time so Danica started to

850
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,872
Get some help I start getting a lot of emails

851
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,224
Afro manufacturers in China what's on my website saying hey we can make these for you

852
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
All right I don't have a lot of other options here

853
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
I'm going to try that

854
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,464
So okay she found a few people in China who could have missed the hats they were actually a lot of things made

855
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
By people in their home

856
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:01,632
But they were all turned out to be different sizes and a little bit different shaped

857
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,960
And some of that was was just the nature of handmade but

858
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
They couldn't go on

859
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,848
Danica realized she couldn't grow her business by knitting the hats by hand

860
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,712
Asking a lot of different Engineers she found one guy in New Jersey

861
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,552
To design her a knitting machine that would put holes in the Hat

862
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
It can make

863
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
I had every 18 minutes

864
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,488
And I have to stop toilet about every 6 to 7 hours

865
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
And so I can get about

866
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
60

867
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Pat and a day

868
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Tax company is called

869
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
Peekaboo ponytail hats since we last spoke with her

870
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:47,456
Danica has been thinking about marketing peekaboo hats in countries like New Zealand in Australia where is winter

871
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
From June to August so she can keep selling her hats your round and she's working on 5 News
