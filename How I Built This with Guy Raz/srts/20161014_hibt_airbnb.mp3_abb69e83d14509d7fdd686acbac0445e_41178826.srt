Biggest hotel chain in the world

15
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,320
Pictures ago you been 5 years ago most of us would have thought the idea of

16
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,392
Renting out a room in our home to a complete

17
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Stranger

18
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,792
A little creepy even spending the night in someone else's home you never met with

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Probably seen weird

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
Especially on vacation or business trip

21
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
But now it's not just normal it's actually the preferred way to overnight from millions of people or

22
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
Around the world celebrities do it

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,176
A company that made all of this normal of course

24
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Is Airbnb

25
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
Guys who started it

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,856
Add no background in travel or Hospitality or even technology

27
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,464
Joe gebbia graduated from art school at the Rhode Island School of Design

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
Franceschi is co-founder was Jose College buddy they

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
Play pickup basketball together

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,912
And actually graduated in 2005 both

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Joe and Brian moved out west

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Brian went to LA

33
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Going to San Francisco

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
And in the first year Joe who was designing book covers at a Publishing House

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Worked

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,504
Really hard to convince Brian to move up to San Francisco to start a business

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
Is Joe tells a story after some prodding

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Brian agreed

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,744
Both of us simultaneously quit our jobs he left his I was at Chronicle Books full-time at that point

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
And I left

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
2

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
To dream of something with him

43
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
You guys were like in your

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,264
20s need a whole lot of money presumably

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,848
I get this point now we're just a couple of college grads you know eating Ramen

46
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
What is everybody Ramen Everybody Eats Ramen so cheap Ramen Ramen Ramen

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,368
Give rice rice cereal to Mexico

49
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
You're eating Ramen

50
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
And what you're just like spitballing ideas

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
We spitballing ideas that first week was so exciting the first week

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,144
He comes you're you're like my God yes I mean the first week felt like RISD again

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Place is full of ideas

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
And then

55
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Something ominous

56
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
A letter came in the mail

57
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
I open it up it's just me

58
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
Pulled out and its former landlord

59
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
To politely

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
States that are rent

61
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,392
Is now 25% higher than it was the month before weight in one month

62
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
By 25%

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
25%

64
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
And that's legal

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
It was not under my control

66
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Wake me up with Intuit

67
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
And so we would like

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Freaking out

69
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Of course I went random eye

70
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
My online banking and it was like oh my God oh my God can I make rent next month and Bryant the same thing we realize that we we almost

71
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
We aren't getting paychecks at this point yeah

72
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
So

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
This is the moment where

74
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Your back's against the wall

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
And I feel like

76
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Call the creative training at we'd received

77
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
Start a payoff if you start to think about okay well how come

78
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Designer way out of this

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
And that was when I

80
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Reflected on

81
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Previous experience I had

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
Back in Providence

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,935
The day before that I laughed I drove cross-country I sold off all my stuff

84
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
And when I was having that yard sale

85
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
This guy pulls up in a red Mazda Miata

86
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
I start looking my stuff

87
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
And I'm getting pretty annoyed cuz I'm ready to go home

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Bonanza buying a piece of art that I was selling so we got to talkin

89
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
And he tells me all about

90
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
How is about to go into the Peace Corps and driving cross-country

91
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,487
He doesn't know a soul in Providence so I can buy them out for a drink that night

92
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
And I make the mistake of asking him

93
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
So are you staying the night

94
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
And he makes it worse by saying

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
Actually I don't have a place man

96
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Like we've all been there right like my house this guy

97
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
So before I know what I'm saying I'm like

98
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
You can stay in an air bed in my living room

99
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
Goodnight is set him up in the living room

100
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
And I I go to bed I try to fall asleep

101
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
I'm staring at the ceiling thinking

102
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Oh my God

103
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,095
What have I done there's a complete stranger in my living room

104
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
What did he say

105
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
So I get up I tiptoed my door

106
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
And I go lock my bedroom door

107
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
The next morning we wake up

108
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,103
We get breakfast together turned out he was not psychotic

109
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
10 piece of artery but hangs in

110
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Classroom

111
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
He's a teacher now and he still

112
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Saint Joseph

113
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Don't touch

114
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,647
So this is a dude that entire would eventually become Airbnb so how did you

115
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
So you're in your apartment your rents going up 25%

116
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
And what do you

117
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Used Lexus rent a room

118
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Well I'm looking at my laptop

119
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
And there's a design conferences coming to San Francisco

120
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Industrial designers

121
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Conference

122
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,847
On the Converse website in Big Red Letters it said hotels

123
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Sold out

124
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
And

125
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Man what a bummer

126
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Designs want to come last minute and I can have a place to stay

127
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
And in that instant I woke up and I'm looking around the living room

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Can't wait

129
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
With so much extra space here

130
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
And I have earbuds in the closet and the idea of Hosting people on air beds

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
I'd rather we become natural to me

132
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
And

133
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
The thinking is

134
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
It'll be more than just

135
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
The place to sleep we can cook breakfast in the morning will pick him up in the

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Airport

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
I will give them a neighbor who died and a map to San Francisco

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
So did how did you get the word out that it has these designers noted

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
This is available

140
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,735
Well we can know we didn't want to use any the classified websites cuz there's going to be people in her home

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
So we made our own

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Raining in Adrian

143
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
What we did on your website

144
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Perhaps you design your own website

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Stead said what

146
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Well it said

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Who we were it said about that this concept of

148
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,071
Stay with us mobile provide these things for you

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
This website was just for the design

150
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
That's it

151
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
Recipe for 1 week at the website

152
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
It was a little recalled air bed and breakfast. Calm and

153
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Start get emails from around the world designers who needed a place to stay

154
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
From London from Brazil from Japan people actually started sending us their resumes

155
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
LinkedIn profiles to 2/4 one of these B's limited 3 air bed

156
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:37,983
For $80 a night you could stay in San Francisco with Brian and I

157
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Square

158
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
Yeah so is more Catherine and Michael were the first three guests and

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
You know

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
What happened next I don't think we could have predicted

161
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
They stayed with us and we got to show them

162
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
San Francisco they got to

163
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Get the feel like they

164
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
They belong there in the sense that they don't feel like Outsiders

165
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
You know what I mean like yeah

166
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
And you'll never forget

167
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
Saying goodbye in and watching the door

168
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Door click closed

169
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
And thinking with Brian

170
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
What if we made it possible for other people

171
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
Thought I'd share their experience in and

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Gas in their home and show off their City

173
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Yeah

174
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
At what point did you and Brian look at each other and go

175
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Okay man

176
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
I think this

177
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Start business

178
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Was it like right after that door closed

179
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,207
I wish I wish it was but I can say that that was the case

180
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Send that December we both went home

181
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
For holiday

182
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
End

183
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,679
A respected New Year's Eve parties everyone who asks so what are you doing in San Francisco

184
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Say what were entrepreneurs

185
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
What do you want for neutering

186
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
And we just really have very much

187
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,175
Other than to say well let me tell me this time we hosted these three guests on air beds in her apartment

188
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
And one of two things happen

189
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
People do said

190
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
Oh my God that's the coolest thing in the world

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Where can I do that

192
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
Or they said that is the most bizarre creepiest thing I've ever heard

193
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
And they left the conversation

194
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
And I think one of the things that I've learned is that great ideas

195
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
I think they usually start out

196
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,911
As polarizing are not kind of like it's kind of okay

197
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,055
They either really talk on somebody's emotions are an elite and desire that they have that's never been answered

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Before

199
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Were they really

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Heard them in some way

201
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
As long as there's people who really gravitate towards IDM

202
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
To me that's a signal that them you might be on Sunday

203
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
So

204
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
What you do but how would you guys do next

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Well

206
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
We knew that we needed a great technical expertise

207
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
And

208
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Funny thing

209
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
The roommate who moved out that Brian can move in

210
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Was a guy named Nate with Charizard

211
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Meet with an engineer

212
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Who found me on Craigslist

213
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
And as we lift together

214
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
There were some similarities in

215
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
How many tonight

216
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Worked

217
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
Which is that we come home from her day job

218
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
And in the evening

219
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
We would both

220
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Work maniacally on her own projects

221
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
And I look over my shoulder

222
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
I remember thinking to myself

223
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
This guy has to work ethic just like I do

224
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
If I ever need an engineer

225
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
I think I'm going to

226
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Call Nate

227
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
So here we are

228
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
January

229
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
2008

230
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
So I meet Nate for a drink I die

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Tell me about this this

232
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
Weekend experiment with these three guests

233
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
And

234
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
I need love the idea

235
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
He's like

236
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
We can use the internet tax you get people off the internet how cool is that

237
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
And he have these like this coating

238
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Experience

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Scyther yuan

240
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
No Brian

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
Use a computer science degree from Harvard yeah it sure did

242
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
So I guess at this point you have your

243
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Your team assembled

244
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Idea

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
If your website so when do you

246
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
What you really decide to launch it

247
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
We all agreed that we would watch the next version of her sight air bed and breakfast

248
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
At the next big

249
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Tech conference because

250
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Actually we thought the original opportunity was

251
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Housing for conferences

252
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
It's right so the next week when I was coming up

253
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
What's South by Southwest

254
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
And every year the same thing happens Hotel sell out months in advance people Scramble for housing

255
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
And it's also the the the place where

256
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Some of the attack grated launch

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
West Twitter launch their Foursquare and others

258
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Recycle this is perfect

259
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
We're just going to follow the rocket ship that the all that didn't

260
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
So at this point we have about three weeks to build before South by Southwest

261
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
I'm doing design its encoding

262
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,079
We're just on a piece together

263
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Point of no money at all

264
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Just doing this

265
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
So

266
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
We get it out just in time shipping

267
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
When you say your ship it what do you mean

268
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
We release the next version of a site

269
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
And we think this is this is the next greatest thing at this point there's not a single listing on right

270
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
But yet

271
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
We actually had six people

272
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Put up listings in Austin and we had

273
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Two people

274
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
What does sweating

275
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
One of them

276
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Luke Bryan

277
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,943
So it was not a smashing success at all this is where you guys like

278
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Sad are you laughing about it or

279
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
Now this is completely demoralized

280
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Yeah it was this idea that we were so excited about

281
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
And nobody

282
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Took us up on the idea

283
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
So we learned two things from Austin

284
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
The first was that

285
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Exchanging money in person

286
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
It's really awkward

287
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Especially inside of a home

288
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
So we thought we'll

289
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Why do we pass exchange cash in person

290
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
What if we just bring the transaction online what if we allowed people

291
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,807
To see monthly pay with a credit card same me you would for traditional combinations on the internet

292
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
But instead you get somebody tell me

293
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Right

294
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
And suddenly

295
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
We realize we had a business model

296
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
We said well maybe we'll just take a transaction fee

297
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
As we

298
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Flow the funds from guests

299
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
The Host

300
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
The second thing we learned is that there were people who did want to travel

301
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
Where they weren't after taking place their emailing us including our first three guess, Michael we must hate

302
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
I'm going to Vancouver next week

303
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
How do I stay in somebody's home I had such a good experience he got some like whoa

304
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Is there a conference going on

305
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
YouTube

306
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Why does it need to be Converse maybe this is just

307
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Trapezoid

308
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
So we went back to me and said

309
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
What's the what's the ad payments

310
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Let's make this a travel site

311
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
And they start to warm up the idea

312
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
But had some real

313
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
Questions about how to get to Marketplace like that started

314
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
So he started to build something

315
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Even more ambitious

316
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
Well actually he moved back to Boston

317
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
To be with his girlfriend

318
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Kind of the Bands falling apart a little bit

319
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
And that's only had an idea

320
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Which was

321
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,087
What if we re watch this new version of our service

322
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
And we do it

323
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
The crest

324
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Of a tidal wave

325
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Press

326
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Which in summer 2008

327
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Was Barack Obama

328
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
It specifically

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Obama speaking at the Democratic National Convention

330
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Denver Colorado

331
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Where

332
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
There was a housing crisis

333
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Because

334
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,639
100000 people are anticipated to see Obama speak

335
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Andover

336
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
Less than 30000 hotel rooms most of which were picked up by delegates

337
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
So this is a real problem in fact the mayor of Denver at one point thought about open up the city parks so people can camp out

338
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,071
What if we time the relaunch of a service to be the third launch

339
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,471
During the DNC we can ride the coattails of all the Obama press to bring what awareness to the

340
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Marketplace that's exactly what we did we hustled Seafood in Denver we met people on the ground we got local

341
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Press was turned into Regional press with turn the national press and eventually International press

342
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,087
Wow and so this is still weeks before the convention this is like July 2008

343
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
What happened

344
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Well

345
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
We did a live interview with CNN

346
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Formal living room

347
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
And we have about a hundred people

348
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
Actually book and pay with a credit card at your service

349
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Which this was like the first

350
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
Sign of overworking viable Marketplace

351
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,847
Even to the point where we were getting customer service calls

352
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
For the first time

353
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
And that just like was your cell phone

354
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Yeah

355
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
How did it go

356
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
Wait we ended up going from 0 to 800 home

357
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
It's a matter

358
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
4 weeks

359
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
So 800 homes

360
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Are on this site called

361
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Airbnb

362
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
That's right and I have to tell you

363
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
I thought that this was it like this was

364
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Our

365
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Rocketship to the Moon

366
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,079
You thought we made it we're here we got it right this if you build it they will come and look what happening and they came yeah

367
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
And then the convention ended

368
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
And

369
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
All those numbers came crashing right back down

370
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,343
So here we headed to Lana because at this point we'd also started talking to invest

371
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
With all this is a great time to talk to investors or numbers are up yet

372
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
Working with stories that we can share with that press

373
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
We get

374
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,095
Introduced to 20% Silicon Valley

375
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
None of them reply to her email

376
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Five of them units

377
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
Coffee

378
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
0

379
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Invested

380
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
In US

381
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Wow

382
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
It was completely demoralizing

383
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Like 2008 was the worst year of my life

384
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
Really oh my gosh yes because you put so much into this thing

385
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Write like

386
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
I don't have nothing else going on in my life except this

387
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
And to put it in front of very credible investors the guys are to pick the Googles and PayPal and YouTube's of the world

388
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
And since the focus Square in the eyes ago

389
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
It wasn't weird

390
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
I'm not invested in this

391
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
What do they say what what why

392
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
Well they didn't say this but here's the underlying reason

393
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
It's because we've all been taught since we were kids

394
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
That strangers evil Danger

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
No one in their right mind

396
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Investment service that was

397
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Based upon

398
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
This pitch that

399
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
What we want to build a website

400
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,135
People publicly post images of their most intimate spaces their bedrooms there bathrooms

401
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
The kinds of rooms that usually closed when people come over

402
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
And then

403
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Over the internet

404
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,095
You can invite complete strangers to sleep in their homes

405
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
It's going to be huge

406
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,959
So so this is like back to the conventions you're thinking

407
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,079
We got it we're going to get all this make all this money and I'll raise all this money in and all of a sudden you get back to Sanford

408
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
Just go and nobody wants to give you any money

409
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Exactly

410
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Nobody

411
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
How are you keeping up the business

412
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Going if you didn't have any

413
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
Any cash we did raise around financing we call it

414
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
The Visa round

415
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Which missions are you

416
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
If you max out your credit card

417
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,279
You know those binders reheat baseball cards

418
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah I had one of those except the one baseball cards and credit cards

419
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
We would go through Visa

420
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
After Visa

421
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Two MasterCards on final two Amex

422
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Just maxing out

423
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Credit cards

424
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
That's how we funded herself

425
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,735
I can tell you like there's not no worse feeling than getting a credit card statement that's only going up

426
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,575
With no hope of ever painted town named for this by the way

427
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
In the startup world

428
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,463
There's a name for this phase of a company where you have a product in the market but they don't fit yet

429
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,351
It's almost like two gears that don't touch this mysterious gap between these metal gears

430
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
That you can't figure out

431
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
How to close the gap

432
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
And because the trough of Sorrow

433
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
It's a long

434
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Period of time

435
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
You don't have product Market fit in

436
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,783
In the data and analytics it looks like the Midwest of analytics because it's perfectly flat

437
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
There's zero growth

438
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
And this is when people tend to quit this is when people tend to quit

439
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
Emily come back how to give you in as partners eventually climb their way out

440
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031

Just one more thing before we get back to the show

457
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
We've been

458
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,487
Incredibly inspired by the hundreds of stories

459
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
You sent us about the companies you are building I'm just read a few examples here we heard from Seth

460
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
He'll he's got a company that

461
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
Taking pre-orders for a product that grew out of a

462
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
Camping trip extra pieces

463
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,407
We grabbed are nylon hammocks strung them up on a little island in the middle of a lake

464
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,807
It's froze our butts up so he's now got a prototype for a product

465
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,951
It's an insulated hammock that he says solves cold butt syndrome which is a real thing look it up

466
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
We also heard from Leah fazzini she started semolina artisanal pasta 2 years ago in Los Angeles

467
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Business before and she's had some

468
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
Real hurdles like she says she engaged in some hand-to-hand combat with her pasta extruder and she lied

469
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,967
Bella is doing okay for organic pasta is already for sale online and in Holt

470
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
Food stores in Southern California we also heard from Larry Moss of Rochester New York you rights built my business

471
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
Out of thin air based on a product that typically lasts a week

472
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
Hillary is talking about balloons like the kind you make balloon animals out of except his balloon sculptures

00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008

476
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Dr. O r g that's billed with a d. Npr.org

477
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
It's how I built this from NPR

478
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Gyros

479
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
Its 2008

480
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
Jonas Partners have no investors

481
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
And a lot of credit card debt

482
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
And I'm trying to figure out

483
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
How to raise

484
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,384
It was at this point that Brian and I are in the kitchen late one night like 2 in the morning

485
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
And we're just trying to keep each other's spirits up

486
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
And

487
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,784
During the peak of Obama vs McCain

488
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Is like September

489
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,000
And we're working on this idea of being are bed and breakfast in providing maybe we give our hosts breakfast cereal to give their guests

490
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
Would it be funny if it was politically themed

491
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,912
Oh yeah we call it like a Obama O's the breakfast of change

492
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,008
Or maybe at McCain's Maverick in every bite

493
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
And we actually ended up making breakfast cereal

494
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Wait

495
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
You made breakfast cereal

496
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Like actual cereal to eat

497
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
That's a good question

498
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
Which is how do you make breakfast cereal and how do you do it with not zero budget but a negative urine a deficit by the way

499
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
So you know I pick up the phone I called Kellogg General Mills

500
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
And

501
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
Check onto the pitch and I got hello

502
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Hello

503
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
It hung up on me

504
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
And then it dawned on me will maybe we don't have to make cereal

505
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Maybe we can just

506
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Go to the grocery store

507
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Buy some cereal off the shelf

508
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Designer unboxing

509
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,272
Put the bag of cereal in her inbox you would up and and sell it that way

510
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,880
Just sell it on the street well maybe it'll make website

511
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:28,000
Instead of Airbnb or in addition do not assure

512
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Then the question was

513
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
How do you make the boxes

514
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
So I found an illustrator

515
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Did Art Direction put all the pieces together

516
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
I found a RISD alumni

517
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
In the East Bay here in San Francisco that

518
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Winning

519
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
And

520
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
You know I like I poured it all out to this guy sitting

521
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,480
Here's the idea of the concept of really excited. Here's the mock-ups and sketches

522
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
Alright here's what I'll do

523
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
I'll make 500 of each box

524
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
You guys don't have to pay me up front but pay me commission-based underwear sale

525
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
And it dawned on us that

526
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
With 500 of each box will that was a limited edition

527
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
That was a collector's item

528
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
We could number them

529
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
On the top of the box at 500 and suddenly

530
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,288
We decided we could sell a box of Obama bows and Cat McCain

531
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
$40 a box

532
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
She's just a crazy story I don't even I don't even have forgotten about Airbnb where where we going

533
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,880
What's going on with his interview

534
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
Look it's an entrepreneur Bender

535
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
So we make Obama's. Com

536
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,424
We get the boxes Sarah put a hundred boxes together we mail them out to all the press that we

537
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
The Weeknd

538
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Melty way

539
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Every morning show had a box of these

540
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,664
So we didn't get featured on all of these different shows CNN did a live interview with us about breakfast cereal

541
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
And we were the number-one politically themed video

542
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
Altenen.com for the entire day

543
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
And after that CNN interview

544
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
We ended up selling out of Obama bows

545
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
Which is incredible like where did you think you were going to go from there like almost didn't matter because

546
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
$40 box * 500 boxes

547
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
Yeah $20,000 in breakfast cereal

548
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,752
Yeah which was breakfast cereal. We just enough to pay off her credit cards

549
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
All right so you pay off your credit card bills

550
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
And then what you go back to air bed and breakfast well we got to this list for the Fateful dinner one night

551
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
With one of our mentors

552
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
It was Michael Seibel and Justin Kahn

553
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
And so I brought the dinner with them and

554
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
They've been helping us the last couple months and what kind of like

555
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
At the end of the rope and they can tell and they're like

556
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
You guys need some help

557
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
You should

558
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Participate

559
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
In this incubator program called y combinator

560
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,752
Threat dinner we woke up on our phones and the deadline was the night before

561
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
Like come on

562
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
The end up

563
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
Emailing the guy who runs in a guy named Paul Graham

564
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,016
They knew and they say you know a Paul there's these guys if you got this concept and and

565
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
It really benefit from being in your program

566
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Tickle to the application

567
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976

568
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Sabrina race helmets

569
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,864
We start to fill out the applications pretty intense yeah

570
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Aspen X2

571
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
We get this callback

572
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
Better application got accepted

573
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
So we got to the next round which is an interview

574
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Puritan advance

575
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,432
Do the grill each other with all these retail questions

576
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Cheap and expand internationally

577
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
You know what's the next big future going to build

578
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Excetera excetera

579
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,904
And so we going to the interview it's in the small tiny room

580
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
At the Y combinator office

581
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
And as for partners around the table

582
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Sit down

583
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Very first thing

584
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
A toboggan is mouth is

585
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
You mean people actually use this

586
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Miguel

587
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,472
Yeah that's weird

588
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
That's not a good start of any kind

589
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,640
It kind of went downhill from there

590
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
What another room

591
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
Nothing like this is our last chance effort and it didn't go so well

592
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
And that's when I remembered that I had brought a box of Obama's

593
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
To give to him as a gift

594
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Psycho Ronnie back in the room

595
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
I whip out the box I handsome guy Paul we got this for you

596
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Because

597
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
Oh where'd you buy this

598
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
I go well we made it

599
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Because what do you mean you made it

600
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,080
And I told my story in 60 seconds to go wait so you guys funded your company based on selling breakfast cereal

601
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Immediately turned around and put the box of cereal on the shelf behind the desk

602
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
On the ride home

603
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
We get a phone call

604
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Paul Graham

605
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
To inform us that he'd like to offer us

606
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
A spot

607
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
In the Y combinator program

608
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
And

609
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
I'll be waiter found out

610
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,792
That the reason we got in wasn't because of her idea

611
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
It was because

612
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,192
Through the breakfast cereal we can prove to him that we had hustle we had Grit

613
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,544
If we can figure out Hussle breakfast over for $40 a box

614
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,688
We can figure out how to make a website work so you get into y combinator

615
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
And

616
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
What what is a

617
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
Like what does it do for you guys what what happened there

618
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Y combinator was a game-changer for us

619
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
And I'll never forget the first office hours

620
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
That we had with Paul Graham

621
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Sit down with us

622
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
And he goes

623
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Where's your Market

624
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
And

625
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
We all get each other and were like

626
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
We don't really have a market

627
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
No one's really using the website

628
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
But we go you know

629
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
New York is showing some promise we have 30 hosts in New York

630
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
You're renting it there extra rooms out in their homes in

631
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Migas

632
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
Your customers are in New York City

633
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
But you're here in Mountain View

634
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
And yeah we're here for your program

635
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Everything goes

636
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
What are you still doing here

637
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,680
Go to New York City and points his finger at you he's got this thing where he looks at you

638
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Pointer finger

639
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
And it was in this moment

640
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Sitting in this room this tiny room

641
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,616
Wear something profound change for us

642
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Because up until this point

643
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,760
We had subscribed to the ethology of Silicon Valley

644
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,856
Which is that you have to solve things in a scalable way

645
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
Because what happens when one day

646
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
The rocket ship takes off

647
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
You already left behind because your code held you back

648
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
And so

649
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,888
We could try to solve her problems by a coating her way through it

650
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
End

651
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,264
If you remember that didn't get us anywhere cuz we are in the Midwest of Analytics

652
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
And so here comes Paul Graham

653
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Gave us permission

654
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
To do things that don't scale

655
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Such as

656
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,992
Fly across the country and meet the early doctors of your service

657
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,344
Yeah and it was in that moment that we felt so much more free

658
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
To think

659
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
Even more creatively about how we could get our service off

660
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
The ground if you could do things that don't have

661
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Have to scale

662
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
What else can we do

663
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
And

664
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
As we start going through the search

665
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
Results and looking at the house

666
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
Identify the pattern

667
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
And the pattern was this

668
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,824
People just generally didn't know how to take a good photo of your home

669
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,872
So the phone is really bad

670
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432
Sentence of the photos that you had on

671
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Decided that timer

672
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Crappy photos

673
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
Well you know people using their camera phones at the time was like flipped

674
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
Cameras on switch

675
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,464
They're taking pictures at night it just wasn't

676
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
Different merchandising their home and away.

677
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
You would want to stay there so therefore no one was looking them

678
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
And we thought you know

679
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,008
Mozart School took some photography classes in photography my whole life in fact

680
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
The Hobby

681
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
I'm going to bed if we just flew out there for a weekend

682
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
We could probably take some ice for photos

683
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
And we won't charge you for it will do for free

684
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
So that weekend we bought plane tickets Brian and I flew to New York

685
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
We've emailed her hosts all three of them

686
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
We rented a really nice camera

687
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,976
And went door-to-door throughout Manhattan Brooklyn and then other parts of New York

688
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
And it's funny cuz he had knocked on the door and then they open the door and introduce myself

689
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,168
As I am Joe I emailed you from Airbnb

690
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
An account like looking over my shoulder so yeah where's the professional

691
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,104
Photography promise I go that's me to my mom's going to take the photos for you yet

692
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
So you're the guy taking the photos

693
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,968
So yeah I'm taking photos and in what school is at

694
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
The photos are looking pretty good and getting the lighting right

695
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Composition in I'm kind of

696
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,928
I'm staging to place a little bit of skin fluffing the pillows and then make sure that the place doesn't look cluttered

697
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
And

698
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
I show the photos in the back

699
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
The camera said hey what do you think you know do you like these

700
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
And

701
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
These houses were like

702
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,472
Oh my God my apartment looks amazing I can't believe it

703
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Do you want to stay for some tea or coffee

704
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
And so I'd end up spending a few hours sometimes in their in their homes

705
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Just talking with them

706
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
And this is where

707
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,784
Instinctively we went into design research mode

708
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Which is

709
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
Going out and talking to the people you're designing for

710
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Such that you can understand

711
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
The world from their point of view

712
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
To inform your point of view

713
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Yeah and so I called this

714
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Enlightened empathy

715
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:10,496
Which is seen the world so closely in the shoes of the person that you're creating for

716
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
That you can see

717
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
The world that way they see it

718
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
I I bring those inside back and you combine it with your own

719
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Design point of view

720
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
To create something new

721
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
So here we are in the living room

722
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,928
Could you show me how how you check your calendar

723
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
Show me how you message with guest

724
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
And

725
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,792
In those moments

726
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
We saw how are perfectly designed interface

727
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,168
Completely and utterly failed

728
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,008
Well with what we thought took two or three clicks to get done

729
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
People were taking

730
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,872
1012 Quicks they were stumbling around getting the Lost

731
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,200
Within our own website and you guys did not know that up until that point

732
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
We had no idea

733
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,368
And so it wasn't until we actually sat down next to her early adopters some of her most passionate

734
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Early customers

735
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
And they reveal to us

736
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
The mysterious Gap

737
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
Cleaner product

738
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
In our Market

739
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,840
Was the inefficiencies

740
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
R user interface

741
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
What's interesting about this is that

742
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
You don't strike me as like an egomaniac or somebody who doesn't like that you sent me somebody really wants it and it's

743
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,920
Surprising that it took you guys so long to discover this

744
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
I know right

745
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
I know

746
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
But once we did it was

747
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
It was like

748
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Is like a jackpot yeah

749
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
So we came back with Oliver our discoveries

750
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Something interesting

751
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Are numbers

752
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
That second week

753
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Went from

754
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
$200 a week

755
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
And fees

756
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
Which is what we're making for 6 months

757
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,520
Right which is not sustainable 3guys cannot leave out that zeref yes go

758
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,360
Are numbers jump to $400

759
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,968
In one weekend we just from pictures and making a couple of

760
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Simple well

761
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,344
I worked at Nasa is there a bug in the system because that's just that's just crazy

762
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
How do we double in a week

763
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
And sure enough we're done more

764
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
Reservations with the house that we had met

765
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
Which was very interesting guy is that

766
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
We didn't notice at the time but because New York

767
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,704
It's such an international destination

768
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:22,080
We have guests coming from Berlin we guess coming from London from Sydney from Vancouver

769
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Kuba coming as guests

770
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
Experiencing this new service of staying in somebody's home

771
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
They go back to where they came from

772
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,320
And it's had this Epiphany moment Saha they go

773
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Wait I have an extra room

774
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,184
Why don't I rent that on the site and they would sign up

775
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
And they would sign up

776
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,792
At what point did you were you able to

777
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Actually

778
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Attract money from investor

779
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Was it around that time

780
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
It's precisely around this time

781
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
So

782
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
What I've learned is that when the gears start to click

783
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Investors can hear that

784
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,872
And they actually this time they came to us

785
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
And get offers coming in from

786
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
A variety of different groups

787
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,552
And the one that shocked us the most was Sequoia capital

788
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
Which was a print it is a preeminent

789
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Venture Capital firm

790
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
In Silicon Valley

791
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,488
That we thought well maybe one day

792
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,816
A year from now we'll go talk to them it's actually they were not going to her.

793
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,888
Yardworks talk to us

794
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,984
Closing a deal with them. We got our first round of financing which

795
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
It's a huge relief

796
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:29,408
We can paint runs comfortably and we can hire start tired team

797
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,248
Cornett at what point do you remember

798
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Sitting with

799
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
What's the name Brian

800
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
I think this is going to be really big

801
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Well one night

802
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
This isn't

803
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
2010

804
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
It was probably like 11:30 at night is really tired

805
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
Mathia this point we have an office

806
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,888
And I used to look at every listing that got added to Airbnb I

807
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
I would go straight at night and just click through

808
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Each of them

809
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
And I come across this one that says

810
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Fiji Islands

811
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
And I'm like

812
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
What's that

813
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
I click on it

814
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
And sure enough

815
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
Somebody out in the South Pacific

816
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Listed

817
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
A 5-acre private island

818
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Our site

819
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Complete with personal chef

820
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
Complete with

821
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
Water sports

822
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
And I'm looking to the photos of thing going

823
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Holy cow this is me

824
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Rentable

825
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,448
And it was in that moment realize that the power the spot forum

826
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
Is that we put it out there and

827
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
The creativity of the people who have

828
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
This could be the back to it

829
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Has gone beyond

830
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,784
Any of our expectations

831
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,440
So you guys have obviously grown much much bigger since then

832
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
A bigger than than most

833
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Are all hotel chains

834
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,608
And you have some similar challenges to two companies like uber

835
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,472
I'm with some City saying hey you know you guys should be regulated like hotels

836
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
So how do you

837
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
How do you respond to that

838
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
I think about that question

839
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,664
In the context of Innovations over the last hundred years

840
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
End

841
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,784
There are three examples that come to mind of new ideas the edge of the world

842
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
That had

843
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Pretty rough start

844
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
Butter now so commonplace in everyday that you'd laugh

845
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
You thought like

846
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
Allow like people are against that at one point

847
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
So ATM machines

848
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
At one point in

849
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
I think it's the 1970s

850
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Wer

851
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Had a lot of criticism

852
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,216
I think they're actually laws

853
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Being written against them

854
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
In certain States. The US

855
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
Cuz it's new and different way

856
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,664
Baking are you have to go inside and then and talk with her

857
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,528
Person behind the desk of you. Maybe up sell you one of the services you just went to

858
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
A computer in a wall in in

859
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Retrieved money for course

860
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Can I retrieve it at ATM machines

861
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
No

862
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,768
The VCR thing is another great example is first patented in

863
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Mid-twentieth century

864
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
But in order to become a product until

865
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
These babies early 80s

866
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,776
Because it was met with such resistance from incumbent industries that didn't want people to

867
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
Watch movies at home

868
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
The car is another example where

869
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
When the Model T came out in 1908

870
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
Representative new way to travel

871
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
But anyway to

872
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
The new form of transportation

873
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,648
And there are certain cities that were against the car

874
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
And they're actually

875
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Laws drafted to

876
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
2

877
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Outlaw cars

878
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,168
But you know after a year of trying a new more efficient way of transportation

879
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
Are the people demanded that they didn't go back to horse and buggy

880
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
And so the policymakers you know

881
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
How to

882
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Modify

883
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
The lost it to what people want

884
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Cancel

885
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
I think the world is ready for our invention

886
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,296
Given that has been over a hundred million people that have stayed in homes all over the world

887
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
End

888
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
The good news is that a city's come

889
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
To learn about what we do and what we offer

890
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
But they tend to want to work with us

891
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,536
Because they see that there's an economic economic impact then

892
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Allows

893
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
People in their cities

894
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Different neighborhoods

895
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
2

896
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
To benefit

897
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
When you

898
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
I think last year Airbnb was

899
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Value of

900
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
20 billion.

901
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Kelly Moore

902
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Today

903
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Is that

904
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Crazy to does that shock you when you think that

905
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,344
You just started this thing and it is an idea that really went nowhere for the first

906
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Couple years

907
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
In your apartment in San Francisco

908
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
And it's not worth

909
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Billions

910
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
B

911

912
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
I don't think about it too much

913
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
I mean yeah

914
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
The things can change if you look at the first.com

915
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Griffin Georgia

917
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
I was so enthralled by

918
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,224
Every day there was a new story of a new company that started in Silicon Valley or San Francisco

919
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
I planted a very deep sea

920
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064

927
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,496
It's because technology moves so quickly that if you're not thinking about what's next

928
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
