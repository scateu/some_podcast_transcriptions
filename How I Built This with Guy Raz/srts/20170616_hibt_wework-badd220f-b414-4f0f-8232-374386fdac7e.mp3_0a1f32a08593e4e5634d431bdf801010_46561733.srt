Why by searching Michigan pure Roberts

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
So they showed it to us

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,552
I'm like wow look for me as coming from a design background like this is sick this is as good as it gets

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392
And I'm and they're basically okay here's the building what would you do with it

And

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024

Floor plans really simple you like a quick like business model I stayed up all night

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,824
You did this in one night

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
Yeah basically because

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,968
We have been challenged was like what are you going to do and we have no credibility right so my thought was

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,856
If I do all this stuff and come back tomorrow it'll seem like we were planning it for a weeks in advance right

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
From NPR how I built this entrepreneurs idealist and the story

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288

What's a back in 1985

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
Someone picked you on an idea to build a chain of stores that

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Just sold copy

30
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
Or saying 2008

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080

Someone told you hey you know I want to open up a salon that only blow dries hair no cuts no color

35
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
I would totally jump aboard

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
But the reality is in the early days

37
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
Almost no one at Starbucks

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Airbnb or dry bar

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680

Last Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey

00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
A decade ago

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
When they started to pitch a landlord

43
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
On the concept of leasing out unused

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
Parts of their buildings for shared workspaces

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
But not just any work

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
A membership include good coffee

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392

Comfy chairs

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
And looks

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Most importantly

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
A built-in community

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
And today that idea they had

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Is called we work

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
It has buildings across

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
The US and in more than a dozen countries around the world

00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Purple long before that happen

59
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Long before the vision of a

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Communal workspace

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Even on Miguel McKelvey radar

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
He was actually living in communal life

63
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Miguel was raised in an all-women

64
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Collective

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
And Eugene Oregon

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,488
There were five women who are all really good friends you know best

67
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
For a long time.

68
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
Pretty much decided to have children without the father's

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Picture I'm just

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Because it was a time when they wanted to break

71
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Free from normal sort of

72
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
Arrangements and configurations

73
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,896
And they all depended on each other for everything sort of like they were we were a family

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
The five women and their children some meatballs

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Bus for girls

76
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
And then 10 years later

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
The basically those five women

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Word connect

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Go to the parents of any of them could

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Be in charge

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Exactly and we all had

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
You know all the holidays together from things

83
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Thanksgiving to you start

84
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Merry Christmas like that was our family like

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Everyone was

86
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Was pretty disconnected

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Did from you know their other

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Biolage

89
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
That was you know that's what I grew up with and I consider them like

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
My mom's my

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
My aunt you know whatever you want to call it in my brother

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Adjective

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Feel different when you were a kid or was

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Is it just like that's Eugene Oregon

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
It's kind of

96
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
5 hearing

97
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
I mean there was a hippie Vibe amongst the

98
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Smaller Community there and there was no kids with funny names you know like I remember a kid named wind

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Do you know in another

100
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Morning Star and evening star in

101
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
I'm so that made you feel not

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
2 weird

103
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,007
I think not until I was older and I realized

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Kind of had money

105
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
That it became an issue like

106
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Things that I

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
Didn't have any

108
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
After we always had

109
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Crappy cars that were always break

110
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Breaking down in light

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Billowing big

112
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
How to smoke

113
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
How to use more like the sort of

114
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Being poorer than the lake

115
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Being

116
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Weird from a family

117
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
You know sort of

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
But at the same time

119
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
I

120
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
I wouldn't say I wanted to get out

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
But I did from a very young age have

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
A dream of

123
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
So

124
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,775
For some reason from the time I was a kid when it would be like saying really

125
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Boring summer day

126
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
I would be like

127
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
You know your what do you want to do

128
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
What do you want to do I don't know what that I want to go to New York

129
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
And for some reason I started saying that when I was a kid and I think it like

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Became more and more of a

131
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
The thing the more I said it in the morning

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Became real and wasn't from like a I hate this place

133
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
I've got to get out of town was more just

134
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
For something big

135
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Wow

136
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
So you grew up in this environment

137
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
You are one boy among

138
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Lots of women

139
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Yeah he's always

140
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
All women pretty much basically

141
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Four Sisters Inn

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
And 5 mom

143
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Yeah

144
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,663
And I mean looking back on it was weird in the sense that like I didn't have

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Like I look at it now in terms of like say

146
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
My own Simon

147
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
The role that I

148
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
I play in his life

149
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
And I realized

150
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
At all

151
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
You know my mom

152
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
Did develops A Love For Sports overtime but when I was younger she had known

153
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Knowledge Ranch

154
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
And you love sports

155
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Yeah I mean from a young age

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
I did but I didn't have my

157
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Guidance

158
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
I'm in Wichita

159
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Why play basketball

160
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
But never I didn't play it seriously until I was really in

161
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
So you know I was like a kid

162
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Hanging out

163
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
With a ball but not like I didn't

164
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Scales and tails

165
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
And keep an eye exclamation

166
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
You are seeing Hawks mean

167
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Ciur

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
6 ft

169
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
Yeah I know

170
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
I can still dunk I'm proud of that I try to

171
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Couple of days ago that's a good

172
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,351
Costco.

173
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
He wasn't just any basketball player he was actually really good

174
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,007
Making the team at the University of Oregon

175
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
So he was good

176
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
He wasn't

177
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Diego

178
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
So he focused on his studies

179
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
I got a degree in

180
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,527
Hunter College Miguel spent a few years trying to build

181
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Startup in Japan

182
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
It was a company that helped connect

183
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
In the back of his mind

184
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
You still have the

185
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
Dream to live in New York

186
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
Maybe even work as an architect there

187
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Shogun 2004

188
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
He started applying for jobs

189
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
So first of all no one does something for everyone to learn

190
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,311
In my experience is that a New York no one's going to reply to you if your

191
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,431
Address on your resume is not a New York who cares like who wants a Deal With It Tina

192
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
So I learned at a friend who my friend's brother was living there and he was like you can use my address

193
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Change my address to his

194
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Address in Queens

195
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Immediately I got

196
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Want to suggest that one switch

197
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Slime

198
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
But I got to

199
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
I think three interviews

200
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
So I'ma

201
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
My flew out

202
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
And

203
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
I think it was a

204
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
A Wednesday

205
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
And

206
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Timeout with one firm

207
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
They were all

208
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Super like

209
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Shikari

210
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Xen like

211
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
They're all black

212
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Cool glasses

213
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Superslick office and all that noise like

214
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Dino ID

215
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Fit in there like

216
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Not for me

217
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
I mean the other one I went to was in dumbo in Brooklyn and it was

218
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Just two guys in

219
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Tiny little off

220
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,439
And they were in jeans and t-shirts and you know they had like

221
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Relaxed vibe

222
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
And you know I talked to him and basically this guy Jordan parnass who

223
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
Was the owner of the farm he was like

224
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,703
Okay great we like you we need you were really busy can you start tomorrow

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
And I'm like

226
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Cuz I said I lived in New York right now

227
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
So literally I've nothing with me I'm like

228
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Well

229
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,063
Can I have a week you know cuz I was trying to make up a lie on the Spotify why can't I start tomorrow and

230
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Renegotiating basically let me start Monday instead of

231
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
Thursday until I Beast I went back

232
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
Portland I literally packed up my entire apartment I called my mom and like Mom

233
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Take all my stuff

234
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
She packed it up and put it in her back

235
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,703
And I moved to New York with a duffel bag on Sunday night I remember I landed and

236
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
And

237
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Never look back

238
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
And you are young but you weren't like

239
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
Another word for like

240
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Somebody starting out from

241
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Scratch

242
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
And the job was $10 an hour

243
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,559
So I mean I was in was like I'd Money in the Bank

244
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
Certified for

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Professional architect

246
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
Well I wasn't a certified professional architect right I was a junior level draftsman

247
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:18,079
Like I was the lowest on the totem pole that's what they wanted they wanted a person they could pay little

248
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Who do odds and ends jobs

249
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Taking that risk it all

250
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
No because I think one it was

251
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
I get to move to New York

252
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Which was the big

253
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Your goal in that was

254
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Do you know getting my

255
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
The door but two

256
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Balada Luz

257
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
You know I mean I didn't

258
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
It's like I didn't have anything to my name

259
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
I didn't have any money I was

260
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
There's nowhere I could there's no way I was going down

261
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
The worst case scenario move back to my mom's house

262
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Eugene for a while

263
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
And what was a job like

264
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
So what happened there which was really cool is that

265
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
The Jordan parnassa grown up

266
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Help with dog training in Montreal

267
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
So Dove is American Apparel

268
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Founder

269
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
So originally when I first went there the project that they had was an American Apparel Store

270
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,279
And it was in lower Manhattan there was one that already done and then they're working on the set

271
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
You need to design a torta like

272
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
Yeah design it and managed the construction end and build-out

273
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:21,823
Yeah it was but also American Apparel this was their first retail right so they were a wholesale company and they were just

274
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Exploring could they do retail

275
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,223
And so it was great timing because one

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
Getting there at that time when American Apparel was just starting out was great but to my background being in business

277
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Actually was applicable to this new idea

278
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Retail rollout

279
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,351
And so what ended up happening was over the course of you starting out in more of project management role of

280
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Okay

281
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Now we have two American Apparel

282
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
American Apparel stores now we have three now we have four now we have five

283
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
It turned from that which was actually managing

284
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
A project

285
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
2 now we've got in the office we have 10

286
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Now we're doing

287
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,503
20 now we have 40 concurrent project how that was how fast

288
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
Explosive there growth what is firm in 2004 and like

289
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Just a few years

290
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
She's like 30 40 50

291
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
200 after 4 years or so

292
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
So mean

293
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
You got to this firm at just the right time

294
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Flight landed this really

295
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
DeLand

296
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Clearly that

297
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Change your life

298
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Yeah

299
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
I definitely had the attitude that

300
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
This feeling that

301
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,247
Every potential thing that's going to come up is something I'm going to use

302
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
And so

303
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
American Apparel

304
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,879
Projects were tough under like really tight time

305
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Timeframes and Doug was like

306
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Really

307
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Intense

308
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
And you know there was times I remember a day

309
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Black Friday is on

310
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Obviously the

311
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Friday after Thanksgiving and I remember him calling me and saying like

312
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,983
We have to have the store open there's a problem in Denver we're not open I'm going

313
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Kill you

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Something to that effect on you was like this is the most important this is the most important moment of your life right now

315
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
You have to get on a plane

316
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Right now to Denver and make sure the store opens

317
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,367
But it was like once you've been through that it's sort of like well what's going to come up that will be

318
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
He works what's more intense and

319
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Person scream at you at the top of their lungs in until

320
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
Respond to it in like a positive way and say I'm going to take this

321
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Experience and know that I

322
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Can learn from it

323
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Do something

324
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
So when you are

325
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Injectafer

326
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Did you

327
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Start my own firm

328
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Business cycle

329
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Keep doing this for a long time

330
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,575
So there was definitely an expiration for me in terms of

331
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
I think really

332
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
The learning curve when the learning curve expires

333
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
That's when I start looking

334
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
King brother think so

335
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
I think once we've done a whole bunch of American Apparel Project tonight

336
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Before I started thinking what what else am I going to do

337
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
And this is

338
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
Kind of starts the wework story is that

339
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Why was working for the firm at a co-worker

340
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Israeli guy named Gil

341
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
And I became friendly with Eminem

342
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
You know where

343
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah I Was An Architect working on American Apparel projects in

344
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
We became friendly and I remember you know he invited me over to his

345
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Apartment one weekend and

346
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
I went over there

347
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
And

348
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
As we're walking into the building

349
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
I think in walks this other

350
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
Dude and

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
We get introduced and

352
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
It's Adam

353
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
It's a hot summer day in the oven

354
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
We work

355
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Adam Newman and he's got his

356
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Shirt off I think which

357
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Just to walk into a New York

358
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,943
You know Condo building rental building elevator with no shirt is one kind of statement

359
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
And then to

360
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
I remember ads were like

361
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
You know going up in the elevator

362
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
Starting conversations with people who are on the elevator and then he's like

363
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Holding the door as the person get off and then continuing the

364
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,839
And I don't know Israelis at all so first of all I'm coming from Oregon I've never met an Israeli

365
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
Play before so I don't even know this sort of abrasiveness which I've come to love

366
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
But there's that and then there's Adam Hoosier

367
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Just has like a really

368
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
You know

369
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
Exuberant sort of personality

370
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
So he was girl's room

371
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
So what I didn't know that at the time though because I mean

372
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
I didn't understand like it wasn't like I'd been pretty introduced or knew the situation or what I was coming into but sort of on that elevator ride it was

373
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Explain to me along the way

374
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
So you and Adam

375
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,167
Yeah that sounds weird cuz it doesn't really make sense to me aside from the fact that we're both tall

376
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
We don't have that much in common I mean

377
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Totally different people

378
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
For whatever reason we just connected we just

379
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,383
There was something between us that just sort of made sense

380
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
I'm so he had a couple of startups

381
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
One of them both of them I think we're baby clothing

382
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Companies and

383
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
He had sort of an idea for

384
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
Innovating a baby clothing by putting on knee pads

385
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
In baby's pants

386
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Saint to protect

387
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
I'm with their called crawlers would she have a baby at

388
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
No no baby

389
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
I don't understand where the whole baby thing come from we have to

390
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Ask him to remember but

391
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
He was interested in succeeding in business

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
And he thought that was a good idea and until he was pursuing it

393
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
And that's actually

394
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,247
The way we became closer friends was he was looking for a new office for his baby clothing company

395
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
And he was looking at spaces in Manhattan and I was like look

396
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
You're going to get double the space

397
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
For half the price

398
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
In dumbo what you know in my building where I am

399
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
In Brooklyn so

400
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
I may convince them to him to move there

401
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:34,399
And so then he was just down the hall from me where I was working at that at the firm on the American Apparel

402
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Did you find

403
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Kind of charisma

404
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
An atom that you saw

405
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Yeah I think so I mean it's more like

406
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,407
Yeah it's a Christmas a good word for it it's also more of

407
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,527
A brashness which I think is cool but which I don't have like I can't you don't like to be

408
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Well I like to be next to the center of attention

409
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,207
That's the thing is that like I like the idea but I just don't want to be a cat

410
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
So I but I really enjoy the energy

411
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Leave that sort of

412
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Comes from

413
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Like I like that

414
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
I like seeing you

415
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
So so

416
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
What happened to he one day come up to and say

417
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
I have an idea and I want to do with you is a

418
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Seamless or is it a little more complicated

419
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
So it's hard to say exactly

420
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,247
That moment like it's hard to remember but but yeah something to the effect of we're talking about this building that were in

421
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
And we're looking at

422
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
The

423
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
Relationship between all of these tenants cool cup

424
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
And then the level of service that they're getting from the landlord

425
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
And he had

426
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Scenes are the business model before of like coffee

427
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
Which I wasn't familiar with but he was like

428
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
I think if we make

429
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,799
You know these office suites we can we can make money we can make more money than the landlord is currently charging

430
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
2

431
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Scream like a bunch of shared

432
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
Offices in cubicles invented

433
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
Exactly so I mean not nothing too complicated other than just like

434
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
Hey right now they lease you an empty space

435
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
With

436
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
You know 2000 square feet minimum

437
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
And you basically has a

438
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
The small business you have it in your own hands

439
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
To figure that out

440
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
Build it out you got to buy all your own Furniture you got to

441
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,495
Sublease space if you can't fill it all up like you're facing all those challenges

442
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,127
And you're paying a good price with the time was you have 20 bucks a square foot or whatever which he knows a good deal

443
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
But it was just a very low level

444
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Service since I think

445
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
He

446
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Brought to me that idea

447
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
And I was like

448
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
I'm sounds great

449
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
The challenge was that neither of us really had it

450
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Experience in real estate or anything

451
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
And so

452
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
He would go to the owners of this building C

453
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
68j

454
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
And say

455
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Hey

456
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
We see there

457
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
Floors that are available here will you least my dress

458
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,079
Well so they were like redeveloping the building over time they were kind of going floor-by-floor and trying to like

459
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,455
You know move people around 2 cuz they wanted to make my rent so they're kind of like improving cuz it was really crappy I mean I was like

460
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Apache

461
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
So they were trying to say they had enough

462
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Thought to say hey let's read about this weekend

463
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Charge my money

464
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:09,023
And so I'm he started going to him saying Lisa Soho floor and at the time and I remember a floor plate there but it might have been you. 10,000

465
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
1430

466
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Repeat and they're just like who are you

467
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
You're like the baby clothing guy who

468
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
We can't even pay your rent on time

469
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah

470
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,847
Why would we rent to you it makes no sense like you don't know anything about it like we're the experts we owned 100 buildings

471
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
And they just kept saying No but

472
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
Credit to Adam in this is part of his

473
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
You know

474
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Innate ability to like

475
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,903
Continue to press even when people say no he just kept going back and back and on those every week for probably

476
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
You sat down together to listen corporate you were just doing

477
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
You're saying he was trying to do this

478
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
Yeah we have no business plan we had nothing it was a very simple idea like

479
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
Hey could we break up

480
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Space inside

481
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
No real

482
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Plan it was just an

483
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Simplify

484
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
The owner of the building

485
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,503
So he's saying no no no no for weeks on end and then one day apparently and I wasn't there at the time but he says

486
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
We are not going to give you a floor in

487
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
But I have this other building across

488
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
I've been clearing out

489
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Come take a look

490
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Hey let's go look at

491
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
This building

492
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
And it's

493
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Beautiful

494
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
It's like perfect

495
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Latino Brooklyn

496
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Warehouse building

497
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Exposed brick

498
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Expose Timberglen

499
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
No beams and columns

500
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
Big Windows views of the water

501
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
You literally like

502
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
You know ideal

503
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
Building 4

504
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
The cool like you know startup Brook

505
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,455
SpongeBob and and they're basically okay here's the building what would you do with it

506
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
And

507
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
I'm like

508
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
What are we going to do

509
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Adam's like I don't know I'm like okay I'll figure it out

510
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Sobe Sky go home

511
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
And

512
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Start thinking of

513
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
A concept

514
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Of a name

515
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Come up with green desk

516
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Which is

517
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Oahu

518
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
The space oriented towards people who are environmentally responsible

519
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Possible

520
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
I buy the domain

521
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
You know I build a website

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
I design some floor plans really simple do you like

523
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Quick like business model

524
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Big Sky we remember when

525
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Kinkos in had business cards made passing Little

526
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Emotional fires

527
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Please put I stayed up all night

528
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
You did this in one night

529
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Yeah basically because

530
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
We have been challenged was like what you going to do and we have no credibility right so my thought was

531
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
If I do all this stuff and come back

532
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
Tomorrow it'll seem like we we we were planning it for a weeks in advance right

533
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Only show up the next day with this

534
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Whole thing and they're like

535
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Kind of Blown Away like

536
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Like whoa you actually

00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Have company

538
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479

539
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Of course Adam

We have not a moment to Adam and Miguel went from being

545
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
Guessing to building their first space

546
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Literally by hand

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm guy Roz so it's 2008

577
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
And I'm convinced of Brooklyn landlord to give them one floor in a building 2

578
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Start a company

579
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
And the idea is to create this

580
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Really cool looking

581
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Space where people can rent out opposite

582
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
In the company of this point is called Green.

583
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Even before they finished

584
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Preparing the space

585
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
They started advertising

586
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,528
I remember the day when we first did it we put masking tape down on the floor to sort of show the layout of the works

587
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,136
And on we posted ads on Craigslist and people started calling

588
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,488
You know my cell phone and I will meet them into him to the building with just masking tape on the floor

589
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
And people started signing up from just the masking to Laughlin

590
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
That just showed how different it was one cuz it was cool and we had a list of all the things we're going to offer you never going to give you coffee working

591
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Cool events this kind of stuff

592
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,384
And people needed it I do believe that you would get

593
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Permanent workspace

594
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
Be yours or

595
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,040
Yeah so the the thing that was happening back then was there was

596
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
Their existing chart of corporate office

597
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
And then there was co-working

598
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
What's the time

599
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Co-working is primarily tech-focused

600
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
It's a lot of like

601
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
You know engineers in a big open room

602
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
Headphones on a gherkin

603
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
And there was

604
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
Some of those wasn't like prevalent but you know there's some in Sanford

605
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Cisco if you in New York

606
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
And they were primarily like oriented towards a group of people who kind of all knew each other and then they're going to come together

607
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,200
Weather and then they all went to work together in the same room in the invite some other

608
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
Adam and I didn't come from that all we were in this

609
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Brooklyn environment we weren't from tattoo

610
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,416
And we were much more interested in this like diversity and all these

611
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
Cool different kinds of companies and what that energy is when they come together

612
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
That said

613
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
All those businesses are doing like

614
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,400
Real sales they're on the phone they're having meetings or talking to people

615
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
So this idea of like a big open room just didn't

616
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,312
Work for us it didn't make sense so I think when we first started it was more like

617
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
You're going to do small offices you could have like a small

618
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Yeah 5 foot by 7 foot one person

619
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
A two-person for a person

620
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Person a person office Inc

621
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
At the time maybe at 12 was

622
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
The largest Lee dead

623
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,160
And that was you know all glass partition so very open and Airy

624
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
And it was really like

625
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
You know hey

626
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Join

627
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:36,608
A group of people working together but you're still in your own private school cost to join

628
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
I think at the time we were probably starting at like

629
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
$300 for like the lowest end and you know went up to

630
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
50000 for a 4-person office at ballpark

631
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,224
Was it expensive when you look at the overall net cost but also not cheap it wasn't like hey this is rock bottom prices

632
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
2008 like

633
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Right before the financial

634
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah

635
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
You know that I think

636
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,696
Positive and negative in the sense that

637
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:07,840
One the world was changing very quickly and there was people who are thinking about things differently you know

638
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Perhaps like working at Lehman Brothers or whatever is not

639
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
You know the

640
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
The best thing for your life where is

641
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
You could have been before

642
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,824
You either have some numbers like that or like how I used to be

643
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
For this company and now I want to do it on my own

644
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
So how many people did you sign up for that first base

645
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
So I mean I think

646
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
Each floor in that building was

647
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,416
A little under maybe I was 70 people are so

648
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
So I think that building was about 350 members

649
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
You know it filled up very fast and then we

650
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Expanded Baptist

651
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
68j what's

652
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
Was the cool thing cuz we went back to the building they wouldn't let us have in the first place

653
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
And started building out more

654
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
You became the Arctic

655
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
Yet so Gill was also our partner at the time so there were three of us and we work together again you know

656
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
Worked on MM Architects help with that

657
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
And then I bet he was still working at American Apparel or with the firm that did that and then Adams still working for the baby clothing

658
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,464
Stylust beats to the operator so I did

659
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
All the stuff to get the business going

660
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
And I really was

661
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Immunotherapy

662
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,936
Whatever 18 hours a day putting the whole thing together and

663
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
I really running it

664
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
You know

665
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
As a very small business

666
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,616
So did you guys start to make money at this like

667
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Very quickly

668
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,528
Yeah so the challenge there was it was a good business definitely right off the bat and we were

669
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
Profitable

670
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
But the problem is is that

671
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Its capital in

672
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,952
So we did the first building under R 50/50

673
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
The agreement

674
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,816
And we started thinking big we're like this is amazing everyone loves it where

675
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
Grow

676
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
And we started looking at Manhattan looking at 10

677
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Cisco thinking of other locations

678
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
But they had a portfolio that they already own

679
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
The owners of the village

680
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,616
So is in their interest to use all the real estate in their own portfolio

681
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
So they're showing us our luck

682
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Gyms in Brooklyn

683
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
We're thinking about building a big brand and thinking this is like a worldwide phenomenon like we're going to change the world or doing something really cool

684
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
And they're thinking

685
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Let's fill up a large

686
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Existing buildings that have big

687
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
Then so as soon as we started talking about like

688
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Other bigger things

689
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,304
It just showed this is not a partnership

690
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Going to work long-term

691
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
So you left

692
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
So we sold

693
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
So he sold to them

694
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
They got a great business was there

695
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,544
They're still operating and we got some money to start over again so they own green.

696
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,896
Leon green. Stay still operated and it's a nice little business what did you guys walk away

697
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
I wish I remember the details but I knew he must have gotten like

698
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,808
Somewhere between half a million a million dollars each

699
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
I mean it was a good amount of money and I think it also presented

700
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
A challenge

701
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
In that

702
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
We had to ask ourselves like

703
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Do we

704
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,816
Take this money and put it in the bank

705
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Or do we view no sort of

706
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
Go forward and invested in the next thing and I think

707
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Bradamant II

708
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
Is clear like we're onto something big here and

709
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
But

710
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Roll with it and

711
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Keep going

712
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,432
Anything for Gilly was a little bit different like you saw this money and was like Hey I can move back to Israel and I

713
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
I've got a bunch of money in the bank and

714
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,576
Hey my life is good so no that was good for him in a good

715
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Result for Adam and I was enough to say okay let's switch

716
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,744
Focus completely to this business

717
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
India to create a new name and a new brand in August

718
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:24,960
So I think one of things that we learned that green dust it was super important was when they when it was really working what was cool was the

719
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
The connection between people

720
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
And

721
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
The things that you would hear

722
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,128
People say to each other in support of each other even though they're in

723
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Completely different Industries

724
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
Just eat a late at night there's

725
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,064
Across the hall people having these really cool conversations about life about business

726
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
And there's also happens of almost like accountability

727
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Cuz one of the things about

728
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,512
Being a small business especially on your own or if your owner of a small company it's like

729
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
No one's watching you to see if you show up in the more I tried

730
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
But one of the coolest things that happens is like

731
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:59,264
Tell people become accountable to each other even though they're not working for the same company so if you don't show up for a couple days

732
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
Someone actually asked you like hey where you been

733
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,640
So that's one of the cool things that happened to sort of like

734
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
Okay we're all working together even though we're separate

735
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
You know

736
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,528
Okay so obviously this point

737
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
You could not be greenedesk

738
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Marceau

739
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
How did you start to come up with a new name

740
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,488
So the problem that we had in trying to reinvent the business is like

741
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
What do you call that I know what is the name for

742
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
A community oriented business

743
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
You know without it sounding too like

744
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
Hippy dippy like how do you come up with something this

745
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
Suggest idea that we're all together in that we want to like

746
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,896
Be open and connected to each other but doesn't have these words in it that sort of sound

747
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
2

748
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Like over the top in terms of you know

749
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Let's all hold hands

750
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
So

751
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
We work

752
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,648
Yeah and I think it took a while to get there

753
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
What actually happened I think

754
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,280
Literally in the middle of the night Adams friend Andrew just

755
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Literally came out with it and he said

756
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
It's wework

757
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Kissui Levites we sleep it's

758
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
We eat at weed

759
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Like this

760
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Flowed with this hole

761
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Fing

762
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
And was a dialogue that

763
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Months old that just

764
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Happened in a moment for him

765
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
In the middle of night and soon as we heard it

766
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
That's it

767
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,760
So where was your first stop where did you go to find it and your first

768
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Place so we look

769
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
In Manhattan a lot

770
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
You did have a non-compete

771
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,256
With our green. Partner so we had a limited number of areas we could go so we're looking in San Francisco and also in

772
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Manhattan and

773
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,448
It was tough and we had a lot of conversations with people who are like again who are you you have no background in real estate

774
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,312
And also people looking for a big credit tenants I mean specially in that environment of of the

775
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
Financial crisis a lot of landlords have been burned even by

776
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
Credit tenant too you know broke their lease

777
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Went bankrupt or whatever

778
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,808
So very few people wanted to work with us

779
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
And we looked at it

780
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
I'm going to space is in

781
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Everyone just said

782
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Why you know who are you

783
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
And so really what happened to me

784
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
It was a friend of a friend of a friend

785
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
Knew somebody in and somehow

786
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
We connected

787
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
For this building I'm in SoHo

788
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
And

789
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
It was really a relationship sale

790
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
You know Adam again like

791
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Redis persistence

792
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,432
And he was willing to go over and over and over to the owner and just

793
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Convince him that

794
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
We were the right tenant for this building

795
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
And I'm in here

796
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
You know he he's good at making connections with people once that door is open like if he's a crack and he can get in there then he's never going to see

797
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Stop until how did you put the money

798
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
Did you guys have the money you have so we had the money from the green.

799
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,216
Celso which was enough for the security deposit and you know it again

800
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
So it's not like this landlord has a

801
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Carnival drops right here not like

802
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,128
Oh there's all kinds of companies clamoring to move in

803
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
Swing like a good place from a real estate

804
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Perspective will take your whole building

805
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
And there's not that many other tenants

806
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
Look like was it ready to just

807
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Rent out

808
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
The people or did you have to

809
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Get it in

810
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Like

811
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Not at all ready

812
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Full. It was actually

813
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
In terrible condition

814
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,656
So did it was it going to require to renovate that building

815
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,728
Probably in the order of a few million dollar

816
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Because

817
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
You had a vision of what you wanted

818
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
To be right like

819
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Imagining light

820
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
You know

821
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Hardwood floors

822
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
Distressed wood floors and

823
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
Beautiful

824
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Appliances and bright

825
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:28,160
Amelia so we were more conservative back then in terms of our investment you know

826
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
We did a lot of the work herself and mutilate the actual labor

827
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah there was a limit to how much they would build versus us until we had some responsibility one of our responsibilities was it

828
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
Wiring all the cabling

829
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,520
And so that we were out there getting bids for it wiring and remember we got

830
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,592
One for $100,000 and one for like eighty seven

831
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
I remember getting those last

832
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
I mean like

833
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
$100,000 is a pretty round number for

834
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
Wiring light

835
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
Shouldn't have like a more detailed calculation of how much that cost

836
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
So my little brother and I he's

837
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,696
The background in he was pretty mad and he's like kind of research

838
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Search scientist W in his brain

839
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
And he had moved out to help us it was me

840
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Tylenol

841
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
And I'm like hey why don't we look into how this actually works in the way his brain works has been to break it down into like the

842
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
The most micro Parts Peekskill

843
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
Every cable run how long is it

844
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
How many terminations you know how do you do termination

845
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Then I mean I remember he asked me to

846
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Going to cost us

847
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:28,576
$8,000 in materials and then you know whatever like 50 hours of Labor whatever the number was it was some

848
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Crazy small number relative

849
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
100

850
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
That's where they

851
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
It's not rocket science so we can do that are

852
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
So we just did it ourselves

853
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
You wire

854
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
The building yourselves

855
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,656
Yeah you would like laying the wire dog

856
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
And all of it so we had to get like a hammer drill and like Drilling

857
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
To The Brick to hold

858
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Like brackets to hold the wire we had to

859
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
I mean I was so much fun it was like

860
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
It was crazy but it was also like we're really

861
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
Fully engaged and we had to teach ourselves how to

862
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,760
That's an eye patch panels and program switches and

863
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
You know so you put in that whole infrastructure

864
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,392
I remember one of the things we had to do was actually

865
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
This thing called soda blasting which is

866
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
If you want that cool like exposed brick has been painted you have to blast the the Sandusky thing called so

867
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
Blasting where you use baking soda to do that

868
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
And we have to buy

869
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,080
Baking soda by like the 50 lb bag and you need bags and bags and bag of the sermon we would like rent Zipcars

870
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,664
Drive out to the place New Jersey load up the car would like to

871
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
A baking soda and we put so much in there that it would be like riding on the wheels on the tire so we be like driving back from New Jersey to the tunneling you because

872
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
As the tide like

873
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Running on the back of the

874
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
The wheel well

875
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
But that was what we were doing was like every step was like we're going to and we rented the equipment that soda blasting equipment just to like do it

876
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
Air compressor

877
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
On the streets of Manhattan just sitting out there like

878
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
This is like the compressor is running out there in like

879
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
There's all this baking soda billowing out of the windows up

880
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Upstairs it was awesome

881
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
You sign the lease to when you

882
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
Open the first floor how long was it

883
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,552
A few months or 3 months probably a maybe a little less with pretty quick

884
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
To take me into that first

885
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Floor that you

886
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
You open.

887
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah so when you walk in you basically have you know an old wood floor which we refinished and had a lot of that cool character hundred

888
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
3 year old work wood floor you have

889
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Exposed brick

890
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Soda blasting

891
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Disorder bring back to that

892
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,752
Rustic sort of vibe we had iron columns that were cool in High character

893
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,568
And then what we sort of inserted into that was sort of a Sharp

894
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,128
Modern Uno glass and aluminum cyst

895
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
So you have this

896
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
Play Between the old and the new

897
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:36,064
And another thing was like from the very beginning I didn't want to have an office Evite at all

898
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
Again this seems not like a big deal now but back then we did

899
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Batman 2010

900
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,280
How quickly things change I mean back then we did all

901
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
Incandescent lighting

902
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,960
Workspace at the time it just didn't use that you had like a cool Brooklyn restaurant in Old auto garage

903
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
You had you know other people say doing boot

904
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,848
Boutique hotels with that buy but in workspace no one did that at all

905
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
So it's totally unique there was nothing like it

906
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
How many

907
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
People joined up

908
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
By the day you open

909
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
I think when we

910
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
First open the first

911
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,600
Floor we are probably in the 70 to 80% range

912
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,184
And then within the first couple of months the first two floors were were pretty much

913
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
So so once this building

914
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Like most people started

915
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
To join up in this

916
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Takeoff

917
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
Was Eydie immediately to go out

918
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
And get investors and

919
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Like scale is

920
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Huge

921
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Okay so

922
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
Part of the story which we didn't talk about is

923
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Before we even built the first.

924
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Are we actually

925
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,688
Had an encounter with a potential investor who

926
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
In a room for one of these potential realest

927
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
CDL so we are pitching a building we really want to get this

928
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Cool building downtown Canal Street

929
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,512
And the owner of it was like you know I'm not sure if I'll give you the building but I got this friend who might be interested

930
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,328
He's going to come over so this guy shows up to the meeting

931
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,192
Sit down doesn't really speak to us from shake hands with these are like an Orthodox Jewish guys

932
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,544
Knowing the black suit and stuff so to me still has an Oregonian a little bit

933
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
Like I don't really know the world

934
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Too well but Adam felt really comfortable with it by then

935
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
But he ends up calling I think the

936
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
That later that day or the next day after the meeting and saying hate

937
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:16,672
I don't think we're going to get that building but I want to partner with you guys and we're like well we don't really need

938
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,744
Partner we got money we're building our own thing here

939
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,768
Is it yeah but I

940
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
What will it take whatever it takes I want to

941
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
How to be a partner

942
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
And so you know we were like

943
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
Why not let's throw out a number

944
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
And

945
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
We'll make it outrageous

946
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:38,176
Is no chance I'll say yes but if he does then he were fighting like we did pretty well and we had no building we had no

947
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
No signed lease

948
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,016
Even and we propose the 45 million dollar valuation

949
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
And

950
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
That's pretty high for

951
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Sephora business that

952
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Is unproven in

953
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
And until you said yes

954
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
I said Okay I want to be a third partner

955
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Antelope

956
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
I'm coming to that

957
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
Which I think at the time was a little bit

958
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:04,800
Scary but at the same time it's like wow that's a real empowerment to say okay now we're going to have all this cash all this cash

959
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Cute dress

960
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,456
So you didn't give us the cash but he committed to it he gave us some of the cash

961
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,808
A little bit to start and then a little bit more overtime and that's actually

962
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
A really great story in the sense that

963
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
He empowered us to think really big because we

964
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
We started out with this

965
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
About this

966
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,560
Valuation netsertive validated

967
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,864
Our picture of the future which was really big

968
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,704
So it was great and we're still good friends with him and everything is awesome but

969
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
That was the first step in the first money that we took his investment

970
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,848
And then of course overtime you got more more investment

971
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
Expanded you build more and more of these faces

972
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
Yeah and I think what we did

973
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Was

974
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
We built fast

975
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
We built inexpensively

976
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
I mean turned around deals really quick

977
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
And we were successful

978
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
You know we built up credibility because each location that we did

979
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
Worked and we did what we said we're going to do

980
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
You know we weren't like saying

981
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
A tech startup where it's like oh there's some

982
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
You know hockey

983
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Ustick

984
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Growth and all the sudden we're going to have

985
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
Millions of users or whatever

986
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
But we were really clear that we're going to

987
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
You know continue to grow

988
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,712
And the vibe in the building's was unique and it was super cool and when people came in they could tell it was something different

989
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
Just on walking in the door would be like

990
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Wow this is something I have

991
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Seen before

992
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
And that validation of both

993
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,184
You know the business is successful it really work

994
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Birthstone chart

995
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
Fundamentals of the business are really good

996
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
And then we're like

997
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,168
You know we're cool guys and we have a good story and we're here at the right time and you know those things all added up

998
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
Yeah you know me

999
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
I wonder

1000
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
You must look at

1001
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Uber ride

1002
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Somebody's

1003
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Big Tech

1004
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
Andy is coming that we think of it

1005
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Giants Ridge

1006
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,248
And you don't we have people in the show people who started companies

1007
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Don't exist

1008
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
White like her

1009
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
And that was a fastest company in history to read

1010
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
A billion dollars in Revenue

1011
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
It doesn't exist

1012
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Right

1013
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Reminiscing about

1014
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Your company

1015
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Now

1016
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
It's valued

1017
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
1817

1018
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Counting dollars

1019
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
It seems like you could be there forever but

1020
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
I mean do you ever think that

1021
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
You know all this good

1022
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Collapse one day

1023
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
You know it's a

1024
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
Great question

1025
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
One of things that we're holding onto

1026
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Bratayley

1027
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,248
Is the feeling that we're still figuring it out

1028
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
That nothing we've done so far is

1029
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
The right answer

1030
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
You still feel like a startup

1031
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
100%

1032
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,744
Value it said about the value is irrelevant right to the business Prof

1033
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,352
Like who cares how much money are worth when you're facing a business problem that is always

1034
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
News about being in that

1035
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Your primary interest is in

1036
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Solving it

1037
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
In a better way so our primary

1038
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Reason for existing

1039
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
Just trying to help other people

1040
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,872
So our problem is like if they change WeChat

1041
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
And it's sort of symbiotic in that

1042
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,736
That way right and that's why I think we don't really have a Finish Line

1043
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
It's not like Hey we're going to figure out some model

1044
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,136
And then we roll it out across the globe it doesn't work that way for us at also

1045
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
That challenge will never stop

1046
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,280
Will have the learning curve forever which is what makes it awesome and Adam and I like we when we talked about this

1047
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,864
Is 100 Year a challenge and it's not like he were building companies

1048
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
We can sell it and move on

1049
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:15,008
We're doing this cuz we think this is the most interesting and biggest challenge we can work on it until it's just

1050
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Keep on it forever

1051
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
When you did your last round

1052
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Financing

1053
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
The company was valued

1054
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
16

1055
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
Billion dollar company that you started

1056
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
In mm

1057
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
10

1058
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Which

1059
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Is

1060
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,280
Do you ever did you ever give her stop and think

1061
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Not

1062
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
That's a good question I don't

1063
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
It's interesting to think about the times at which

1064
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
I hate you

1065
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
And

1066
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:52,128
I would say I'll remember calling my friends when we were first reaching

1067
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
A billion dollars

1068
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
I can remember dinner with one of my best friend

1069
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
When we were at 130

1070
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,831
And he was like oh my God 130 like

1071
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
Are you going to sell in retired and I was like

1072
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,743
What like why would I do that like I'm just busy so much fun you know no chance

1073
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,559
We got you a billion I remember feeling

1074
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,655
Pretty bashful about even saying the words like I remember almost feeling like

1075
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
Like wow I don't want to send this in a text message

1076
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,543
This is going to sound so Preposterous like I want to call and only say it verbally

1077
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
But then you know once

1078
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,943
You cross that threshold it sort of like the other ones going from there and

1079
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
First of all I wouldn't complain about the fact that

1080
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Get to live in Manhattan

1081
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
I'm going to live in nice Apartments

1082
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
And I'm living

1083
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
You know I moved to an apartment with an awesome

1084
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
View and not so

1085
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
Childhood dream to Lexi the New York City skyline

1086
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,767
I reach those threshold where I live agree

1087
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
That's awesome

1088
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
But beyond that I don't have like some big ambition for money

1089
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
It's not really interesting to me it's more

1090
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,983
Again like to be on a path where I feel like I get to

1091
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Continue to engage in

1092
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Something that's what

1093
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
It's really you think about like

1094
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
These

1095
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Huge boom

1096
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Gold

1097
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
Or oil

1098
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Ortak

1099
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,039
And the company's really

1100
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
We're sustainable the company that made money

1101
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,951
The most money off of these industries were they born to service them right like Levi's jeans

1102
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Surface the Gold Rush end

1103
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Is company to service the oil

1104
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
Riggs or you know

1105
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
The become visible the platform

1106
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,471
You guys are kind of doing the same thing I mean there's Aztec boom

1107
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
N&a

1108
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Boom of

1109
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Amazon

1110
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Supernatural spirit

1111
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
And you

1112
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,895
Kind of said what what services

1113
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Let's provide the service

1114
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,575
Yeah that's a great way of looking at it I don't think I've heard it stated that way but I think it's really true and it's not

1115
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,975
Just those things which any Tech boom is important but it's also a shift in what people are looking for in their life and what

1116
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
Their expectations are from work because

1117
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
There's a

1118
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,423
Major shift happening in terms of young people thinking about going to work everyday

1119
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
And what do they want back from that

1120
00:43:53,983 --> 00:44:00,127
People don't want to punch the clock anymore and then have their life start when they leave the office they want their life to be

1121
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,175
Be integrated they want to feel like there

1122
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,735
There's value in what they do everyday

1123
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:11,135
And that's part of the environment that we create you know you can get that so you working a Google Facebook whatever super cool office you know me

1124
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
Maybe you feel this by

1125
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,303
But when you're a small company or so you're working for a bank or one of these places that isn't inherently as cool

1126
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
You may not get that

1127
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
Azizi and what we're offering is something we're

1128
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,959
You're an independent worker or you're a small company of two people

1129
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,799
Where you're like a division from a pharmaceutical company or a bank

1130
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:34,943
We're giving you that name for a cool environment where like it doesn't feel like you're going to work everyday it feels like you're going to

1131
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
You know a cool spot to like meet people and connect and collaborate right and that's I think the trend that we're working on

1132
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,463
Lesser specifically attack or less so than any other business permits more like a mindset shift

1133
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Yeah

1134
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
It is very interesting seeing you

1135
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Talk about this

1136
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
With confidence in a

Barry

1138
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Shut up

1139
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
Queer

1140
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
Way and you

1141
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,311
Animals to seeing you as this kid in this community

1142
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
In Oregon

1143
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
And I'm trying to square that Circle

1144
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
It's it's just

1145
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
It seems so important

1146
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
Plausible

1147
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Sat

1148
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
You know

1149
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
Here you are, real estate deals are price

1150
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
4 sqft and

1151
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
All this

1152
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,927
And I'm not that is a bad

1153
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Right it's just

1154
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
Brightening do you ever

1155
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
I think that's

1156
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
Implausible

1157
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
No

1158
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Primarily because

1159
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
I've been doing all the hard work for the last

1160
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
I mean literally

1161
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
From 1990

1162
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Sex or whenever it was

1163
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
95 when I started architecture

1164
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,711
The score and I committed to the work

1165
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Like

1166
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,575
I work non-stop since then and I don't mean like literally

1167
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
I mean a lot of it was ours

1168
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
But I mean it more like commitment

1169
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
Like I've been committed to the work

1170
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,047
An interested in engaged with the work since that Non-Stop

1171
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,143
And I think that's part of the thing is that I found something that I love

1172
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
To do and I

1173
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
Felt what it feels like to love what you do

1174
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,055
And I've never been willing to give that up

1175
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
And I've been on that track ever since
