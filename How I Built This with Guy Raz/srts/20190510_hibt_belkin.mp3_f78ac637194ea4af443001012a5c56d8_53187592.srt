And out

31
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
To see you informal

32
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
There were days when I thought nothing could stop us that

33
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
This is going to work and that this is going to be the most brilliant thing ever and there were other days that were

34
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Really really dark and I just would hold my head and my hands

35
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,280
And say wow this is never going to work

36
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
From NPR how I built this

37
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealist stories behind the movements they built

38
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Alex Kidd in California watch the PC Revolution unfold in front of them

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
Is Fortune with computer table

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
So what's your regular list

41
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
You know

42
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
How much I love

43
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
The gold rush

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
Because there's a simple Elegance to it

45
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
All those people going to mine for gold

46
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
Heated tents

47
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Pickaxes

48
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Shoveled

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Take me to the food supply

50
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Transportation

51
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
Entire industries were built around the rush

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
And people who had nothing to do with gold

53
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Made a lot of money

54
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
Which can sometimes be

55
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
The smartest way to think about a business

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Especially

57
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Chet Pipkin

58
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
Yes

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
You've never heard of Chet Pipkin

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
He doesn't do a whole lot of interviews

61
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Generally keeps a low profile

62
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,848
But there is a good chance you've heard of it

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
The company

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
NPR computer or

65
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Smartphone

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
You very likely use a Belkin product

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Because Belkin makes

68
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Accessories

69
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Naturetek devices work

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Things like tables

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Surge protectors

72
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Keyboard

73
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Networking device

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
It's a company that was built around the PC boom

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
And then later

76
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
The smart phone bill

77
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Now if you think a lodging business

78
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Is a marathon

79
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
Where the starting line is the idea

80
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Finish Line

81
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Is a successful company

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
I think we can all agree that everyone starts that race in the same position

83
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Name some of the founders we've talked to hit clearly you start out with certain advantages maybe they've got money in the

84
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Bancorp they know people who have lots of money because they went to a top business school or they just start with

85
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
Valuable experience in a certain industry

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
But in his case

87
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
Chet launch Falcon he was just 21 years old

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
He didn't have any money

89
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,224
Kid dropped out of college and he certainly didn't have a clear idea of how business even worked

90
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
But he did have one really important advantage

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
A good childhood in a stable family life

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,488
His parents were both blue collar workers who moved to Hawthorne California

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Farms in the Midwest

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
The second world war brought them both west

95
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,240
My mom doing work in support of the war effort my dad

96
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Also

97
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
And that eventually he was drafted

98
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
Into the Army Air corps

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
And they both settled in Southern California

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
After that

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Will you parents

102
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Educated Beyond

103
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,136
Very little formal education so I think my dad made it

104
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
A little bit past the eighth grade

105
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
And the same was true

106
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
For my mom

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
I think partially because my mom didn't have the benefit of a lot of formal education it was really key to her

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
She was definitely a lifelong learner

109
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
She's the best speller

110
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
That I've ever met in my whole life

111
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,479
How she got there with head limited education I don't know

112
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
My dad was a machinist

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
He worked on a lot of defense and Aerospace work

114
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,279
What he could create out of metal with the his hands was

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Really inspiring

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Yeah they both had bearberry

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Little formal logic

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Besides having a great family

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
The other day

120
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
That hat was

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
The time

122
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
The place you grew up

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,223
Time because he finished high school in the late 1970s

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
On personal computers

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Just starting to become a saint

126
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And the place

127
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Because Hawthorne was a hub

128
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Aerospace and defense contractor

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Anyway After High School

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Chad Stark

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Classes at you

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
UCLA

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Still living with us

134
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
And working out

135
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Few different jobs for money

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
But he didn't even make it through a year of

137
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
College because instead

138
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
He was spending all this time just

139
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Hang out all these different

140
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Computer shops close to his house

141
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,087
A lot of these Engineers had set up these shops they were

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Hobby shops or small

143
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Mom and Pop

144
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Style stores

145
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Selling

146
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
These are early models of

147
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
PCS and printers and modems

148
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
And yeah

149
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
More of them did not wear

150
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Hawthorne Boulevard

151
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,383
So it was a very rich place to I be able to go from shop to shop and just kind of walk in

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,991
Ask a bunch of questions observe and them that's precisely what I did

153
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,831
But were you into computers was that I mean were you like

154
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Trying to program computers and take them apart

155
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Or was it something different

156
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Most definitely

157
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Interested in how things work

158
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
So part of it is I did

159
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
As a kid was I took things apart just

160
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
The kind of see how they worked in

161
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Every so often I was able to

162
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
To unsuccessfully put them back together

163
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
And I had a lot of ideas about

164
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
How to make

165
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Who sings better

166
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
I imagine

167
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Creating a different kind of

168
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Shower head

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
That would maintain a constant

170
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Temperature

171
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
I thought about putting a little

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Metal strips in the road to a be able to

173
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,975
To allow cars to cannot drive themselves down the road and

174
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Different kinds of things

175
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Turn into anything about

176
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Computers per se

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
That

178
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
It look

179
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Like it was going to be

180
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
This next

181
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Huge

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Generation

183
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Transformational change

184
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Ferrum how people might live

185
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
And I wanted to learn as much as I could

186
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
So you

187
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
You are

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
A student

189
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
UCLA

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Hanging out around these like

191
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Early p

192
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
PC

193
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Suzy ass

194
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Shops

195
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
Did you eventually be like try to get a job at one of these places

196
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,911
So there was a bunch of things going on for me all at once I was

197
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Working at the YMCA as a day camp counselor

198
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
Most of these kids were kids that it had negative

199
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Encounters with

200
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Society or

201
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
People of the law or something

202
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
I was also working for an electronic

203
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Components

204
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Manufacturer

205
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Remember I was

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
Counting some of these things and ask them when I go what do they do

207
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
When the person says

208
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Doesn't matter what they do for you just count them

209
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:07,679
And the heck I just sort of smiled and got a catalog and figured out what it is day I did do it

210
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Yeah

211
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,615
I was going to class I should have been doing my homework and I was learning as much as I could about pcso

212
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
So instead of spending time on my studies and my homework

213
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
I finally just said

214
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Why don't I just

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
Give it a go and then it's either going to work

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
Or I'll get it out of my system and then I will take it from there but

217
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
This is just something that I had to go do

218
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,143
And what what what was it I mean what was I mean did you have an idea what that thing was going to be or you just start

219
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
I'm going to do something in computers

220
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
Yashow the early thought was

221
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
Understand this and it's going to be inevitable

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,247
That they're going to be gaps they're two they're going to be things that people want

223
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
To do that the other people are not thinking about

224
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,207
I didn't know exactly what that was but I knew the kinds of things that I was looking for

225
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
And then as I began to hang out in the stores

226
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
Most of the folks seem to enjoy having me around

227
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
I just watched

228
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
And

229
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
What are the things that

230
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Was impossible situation to miss almost from day one was these folks

231
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Goodbye

232
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
This PC and a printer

233
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
And then that they would say

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
How do I make this work

235
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
Well you just plug it in okay well can I have the thing to plug it in with

236
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
And because these computers were being made by all these different manufacturers they had different

237
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
Connectors on them and the printers had different connectors on them

238
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,103
And it's not like the way that it works today that there's a relatively small number of them

239
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
Interfaces to a good things to a work together it was almost unlimited

240
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
In that day and age

241
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
It was an absolute nightmare for folks who were just trying to get the stuff to work for them

242
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Early days of the railroad like they had

243
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,535
Different gauges on the rail line so like what's the other one

244
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
It wouldn't connect cuz they were different sizes that's exactly right and there was no reason for things to

245
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
I work across these platforms

246
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
Until there I was and yeah

247
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
Remind me of trying to sync my Google Calendar with my Outlook

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Calendar

249
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Impossible

250
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
In some ways things have really evolved into gotten better and in other ways when exactly the same

251
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Spot aren't we

252
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Take me into one of these

253
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
PC shop

254
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
In 19

255
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Anyone

256
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
R82

257
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
What does it look like inside look like

258
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Shelves

259
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Stocktwits

260
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
All kinds of different accessories

261
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
Different kinds of computers or was it more like a

262
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
Like a Soviet supermarket in 1985

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
So they all look very similar

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
The

265
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
Proprietor was almost always doing it on a

266
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Part-time basis

267
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
That would be people walking in saying

268
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Hey I've heard

269
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
That I can do word

270
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Processing

271
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
That I do not need to use my typewriter

272
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Anymore

273
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Can you help me

274
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
With that

275
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
So

276
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
This was unbelievably

277
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Explosive

278
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
It was so exciting it was so much fun

279
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Transformational change

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Of course it was changing so so quickly

281
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
So walking into these places and

282
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,391
Talking to folks was one of the primary ways that people were able to learn and

283
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
2

284
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
To be aware of things

285
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Are you say you are

286
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
This young guy and you're watching

287
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Explosion

288
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
All these different small companies

289
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Try to get into this

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
PC thing

291
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Is a clearly see where this is heading

292
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Word processing in

293
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
Spreadsheet stuff now but it's going to be something much much bigger

294
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
What I wonder is

295
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Why is that point in juicing

296
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
I want to be a PC maker I want to get into the PC thing is for making personal computers did you even

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
Think about that it definitely crossed my mind

298
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
But it was pretty quickly dismissed

299
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
The amount of capital that it would have taken

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
To do that and have any meaningful way would have been more than I could have imagined being able to kind of musty

301
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,127
And the Dew and secondly

302
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
There seems to be a lot of people going after that

303
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Space

304
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
And the void I saw

305
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,903
Looked even more compelling and more exciting to a May than making the other Hardware

306
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
Connect with the boy that you said was

307
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Peebles

308
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Yeah I mean there is no

309
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
No missing it

310
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,679
That wow the big void here

311
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Is

312
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Providing

313
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
This elegant

314
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Tool to folks to make the stuff

315
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
Work together the way that it should be able to

316
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
So the path we took

317
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Overwhelmingly on

318
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
It sounds like

319
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
You saw the PC Revolution happening

320
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
That was the Gold Rush

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
That was where all the

322
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
People rushing into and your thinking

323
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
I'm going to sell pickaxes and shovels

324
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
Yeah I think that's a really good way to phrase it

325
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,263
What time we hadn't have the capital to do the stake in the in the mine itself

326
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
But there were definitely things that people needed that was

327
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Fix it for us

328
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
I'm trying to figure this out

329
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
You're like

330
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
20/20

331
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
You realize that

332
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Connectors

333
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Cables that was not

334
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Opportunity

335
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
I like where do you get the wires where do you get the

336
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
The plastic

337
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
To cover the cables where to get there

338
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Pin connector thingies

339
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
So I've been taking the stuff

340
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
Apart and putting it back together

341
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
I've been wiring up things on my own kind of like

342
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Cannibalizing

343
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
Some of the things for other things

344
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
So I had hands on

345
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Experience from tinkering and

346
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
And building

347
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
And yeah just kind of dive in and

348
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Do it so

349
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,647
I went often and bought some cable and bought the wires and bought the connectors and

350
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
And then I started putting them all together

351
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
I think you are still living with you

352
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Parrots

353
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
That is right and I am

354
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,911
I've been in the same house my entire life

355
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
So this first started to happen

356
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
On my parents dining room tables where I was building the stuff at

357
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Night

358
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,431
And after a couple of day does Maya mom goes

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Chat I love you very very much

360
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
You're going to get the stuff

361
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Office

362
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
It's our first big move was from there to the

363
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Garage

364
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
And

365
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
We were there until we moved again so

366
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
And you say we

367
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
Was it was her we or was it just you

368
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,751
Yeah it was just me

369
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
It's just really hard for me to use and I or and me

370
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Infant picture this

371
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
You had like a

372
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,759
Soldering iron and you know what's that metal that you used

373
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,111
Why can't I used to do as a kid solder

374
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
The very first things that I made I use my dad's tools

375
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
And then he was very

376
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
Curious she was very supportive

377
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
He was never in my hair but it wasn't far away and Abby would watch

378
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Xiaomi work

379
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,615
And then he would actually machine other little tools and things saying

380
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Hey do you want to give this

381
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,967
A try I think that this might be

382
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Helpful

383
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,831
He didn't understand anything about the electronics

384
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
But boy that guy was really good at making stuff

385
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
What's that expensive your bunch of wires cables and and then

386
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
Different connectors and then just soldering them together

387
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,727
Did they look like a Homespun like Frankenstein

388
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Wires did they actually look

389
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,919
Professional probate the factory the first stuff we are made was really bad

390
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
So it was really Frank

391
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Anstine stop

392
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
And it function

393
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
Computer shops where you been

394
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,695
Can I hang it out and then do the owners probably use you say Hey I'm

395
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,279
Make me cables do you want to sell them to your customers like

396
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Was that your pet

397
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
And that is exactly right

398
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
I said hey I can build these for you would you like for me to and

399
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
Do that and the answer was almost always yes

400
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
And then the next

401
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
Question from them would be how much do you want for them

402
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
And I

403
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Don't know what do you usually pay

404
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
And then in those early days

405
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
The cost that I was

406
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Paying for the component

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Wasn't competitive

408
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Some of the times I was buying it a place like a

409
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
RadioShack or an electronic store or something

410
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
But my labor was

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
You know

412
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Free

413
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,703
And there was no doubt in my mind that I didn't have to worry about that

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
I just start to make it work and just get a little bit of scale

415
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
And that I'd figure out

416
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
How to get

417
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
The cost right

418
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Alright so you

419
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Started to make

420
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
These cables Frankenstein

421
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Just like what

422
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
82

423
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Around then

424
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
And did you think

425
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
This is it this is my business this is what I'm going to do I'm going to incorporate a business

426
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Make a go of it

427
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Yes I first started getting going

428
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
If I would have been around 1980s

429
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Sure or so

430
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
And then in October of 1982 it was either go back to school

431
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,615
I get another job or dive into Belkin

432
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
A full-time basis and I chose the latter

433
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Alright your name is

434
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Chet Pipkin

435
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
And the company is called Belk

436
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
What's

437
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
The story

438
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Yes I didn't want to use Pipkin because

439
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
I didn't want people to see that the ham shut

440
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
Pipkin of the name of the company is Pipkin. Just

441
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
Same to us Mall

442
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,495
And again at this time end in my life there's alot going on

443
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
And a friend of mine

444
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
He and I were going to start a different business

445
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
That's not Belkin but them something else

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
And because he and I were I going to do that

447
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
I had bought letterhead and business card

448
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Words that it said

449
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Belkin

450
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
The his last name began with b e l

451
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
And so then when we went to begin Belkin I called him up he was doing other stuff then

452
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
I said hey do you care if I

453
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
Use the letterhead and business cards that them say valken and he said no go right ahead

454
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Yeah that's how we going to start

455
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,711
And was it still just you and I 1982

456
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,063
Yeah so I drafted my brother who was working for me for

457
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Free

458
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
My dad was helping out like making the tools and being able to make things easier

459
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
My friends would just kind of come by to see me cuz I didn't have a lot of time for printing

460
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
Social time then

461
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
So they would come hang out with me

462
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Make things with me while they were there and then they would leave they would go off and do

463
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Other things so

464
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,551
And then hired the first person on a full-time basis

465
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
And then hired the second hired the Third

466
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,767
We all worked around this big table I had built it was a 4 by 8 piece of

467
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Plywood

468
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,143
That I put a piece of laminate on the table and make tables

469
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Direct

470
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,751
Yeah that I would I would go out and sell it so that I got

471
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Our own separate phone line that we put up in the garage

472
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,551
Still in the garage we had cables long links of cable literally going up

473
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
Up and down the sidewalk neighbors would come out and say what are you guys doing we would explain it in the truck

474
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
Trucker cap or something and then

475
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
As more and more was taking place there you know bigger and bigger trucks where I come in the house delivering goods and

476
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,567
There is simply just too much going on for the garage to hold us

477
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,431
So then we moved our first building over the holiday

478
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
1982

479
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
We've always called her official start date January one of

480
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
1983 baidu

481
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
The actual work started

482
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
A couple years prior

483
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
How did you how are you

484
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Growing

485
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
You started out by just selling it

486
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
The shops on Hawthorne

487
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Boulevard

488
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Were you driving

489
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
All over LA and going to

490
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
Shops or we're different shops finding out

491
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
What about the cave

492
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Grapevine

493
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,383
Yeah in the earliest days it it was all out

494
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,039
And almost immediately our constraint was a more ability to make the stuff

495
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Quickly enough

496
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
So we actually did have any trouble

497
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Getting orders

498
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
We had trouble keeping up

499
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
And then as we increased our

500
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
Capacity

501
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Then I would had a couple more

502
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Places

503
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,984
And then I think we ran our first ad and computer dealer magazine

504
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
And we got an order

505
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
For a hundred pieces

506
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
There's one of our bigger

507
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Biggest hoarders ever

508
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,968
For cables that went for the parallel port from an IBM PC 2A

509
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Turn Epson

510
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Printer

511
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,136
And about a hundred of these things it was the student store

512
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
From Carnegie Mellon University

513
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Oh wow

514
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
Why wouldn't a

515
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
A computer company

516
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Like IBM

517
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Apple at the time

518
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Have just made their own

519
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Tables

520
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Connect to their own products or

521
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Another product

522
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
And just said

523
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
You can't

524
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Make these we are going to patent this

525
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Technology and nobody else could do this

526
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
Yes I think that there are a lot of reasons that it didn't

527
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,064
When was IBM had their hands full just making enough

528
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
PCS

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
I bet it feels like

530
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,952
It was probably years there were just not enough of them getting built

531
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
And

532
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
They

533
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
Have no idea

534
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
What printer

535
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
Any given small business or consumer

536
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Was going to choose

537
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
And

538
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,824
Most of those printers had different connectors on them so they wouldn't even know

539
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,664
Which one thing to make there really wouldn't be such a thing

540
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
So I think

541
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
A little bit too small

542
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,576
And too much work for them and for us

543
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
Perfect size and just the right amount of work

544
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,488
Year one official year was 1980

545
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
3

546
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
You hit $180,000 in sales

547
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
That year

548
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Who suggested like

549
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
Four or five people making

550
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Everytable

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah let me think about the number of people

552
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,104
At the end of 1983 we probably

553
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:17,504
We must have been a like in the 25 ranger Power something yeah

554
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
Shut in 1983

555
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
That's right you were 23 years old

556
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
You got 25 employees

557
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
180000 in sales

558
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
You are running a business

559
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,864
I mean you know what to pay people

560
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
Know how to manage people out of do the accounting like did you eat what were you overwhelmed with all those things

561
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,384
Yeah so that's a really good question I remember saying to my dad

562
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
SS was just getting up at the house I go that I don't know anything about accounting

563
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know anything about like

564
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Being able to run a

565
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
Run a business I got off licenses all that stuff exactly and he looked at me

566
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
Me straight in the eye

567
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
They said

568
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,240
You don't worry about that one bit you're going to figure all that stuff out

569
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
You just stay focused on creating things that people want and if you get that part right

570
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
The rest of it's all going to work

571
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
But there's a

572
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Funny

573
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
Funny things

574
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Along the way from me not knowing

575
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
And then there were MoMA

576
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
When when things happen

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
There's a bunch of those so

578
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
October of 82 I was actually 21 I was almost 22 years old so I was 21 when I

579
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
I embarked

580
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
So I knew very very little

581
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
When we moved in for that building

582
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
I didn't realize we had to turn the electricity on

583
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Nonso it's a mad power

584
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
But then the guy came to turn the power off.

585
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Because it was from the

586
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
China

587
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Apps

588
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
We are literally in there working this

589
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Sky shows up

590
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
From Southern California Edison

591
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,280
He walks to the back of the building in and he turned our power off

592
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Right

593
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
And

594
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
So

595
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,912
I look out the back door and I go are you going to turn the power

596
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Back

597
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:17,056
Hey basically says hey you an idiot you have to call in and actually establish

598
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Service

599
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,200
And then somebody came from the city and said hey you have a business

600
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
License

601
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
How do you spell what is that how do you get one

602
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
And

603
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
So you know there must have been

604
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
50 of these moment

605
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Where I just did not

606
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
No

607
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
And

608
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:42,400
Somebody eventually ask Torquay Mom calling and then you know we just took care of it then but

609
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
United know how to do the book

610
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
Yeah where you like collecting

611
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
You don't billing people in in

612
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
Accounts receivable and payable

613
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
Pictures of papers all over the place

614
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Shuffle

615
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
Yeah so you know we created a

616
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
Purchase order form to kind of buy things off of but it didn't have a purchase order numbers we just went like 1 2 3

617
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Free piano

618
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
Really really crude stop

619
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,608
We don't have a lot of money always the cash flow was very very tight so if it was a bill offended

620
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,400
Stuck it in a desk drawer

621
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
And just said

622
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
You know I'll deal with it later

623
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
My girlfriend at the time she's now my wife Jan

624
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
Worked in a family business in Northern California

625
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,296
And she knew how to do all this stuff and so then she would come down for the weekend

626
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,392
He would dig out all of these old bills and get them taken care of and

627
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
Kind of show me how to do the books and

628
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,280
It took a little while for me to get that damn concept but

629
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
She was a really really big help

630
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
So she actually saved your butt and your early days

631
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
She did

632
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,032
Yeah and then after we got married she came to work at Falcon

633
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
And

634
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,920
I remember I got a call from a guy he worked it up

635
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,248
Place called Computer Stop one of our bigger accounts

636
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
He said

637
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
Hey this new collections person um have is an absolute and I won't use the word but it

638
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
It was not a very

639
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,328
Polite word and I said oh you you've met my wife Jan

640
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,984
Yeah so everything everything worked much much better

641
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
And she was

642
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
Unbelievably brilliant and awesome

643
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
So the quality went up

644
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
The production efficiency went up

645
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,016
Our receivables went down

646
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
I was not always really Pleasant to work

647
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Well she was very patient with me though

648
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
But I mean

649
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,976
Did you feel any stress about all of those

650
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Those things I mean

651
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm coming in the mail in the letters from the IRS or whatever might be did did ever

652
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Stress you out

653
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
It was a nightmare there were days

654
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
When I thought nothing could stop

655
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Bus that

656
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
After this is going to work and that this is going to be the most brilliant thing ever

657
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
And there were other days that were really

658
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Really dark

659
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
And

660
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:11,136
I just would hold my head and my hands and and say wow this is never

661
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
We had a customer file for

662
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Chapter 11

663
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,888
And we didn't have the money to cover the money that we weren't going to get from them

664
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
And

665
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,520
I went to a my dad to I borrow money and my mom and dad didn't have a lot of

666
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,872
And he took a loan out on the house.

667
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664

669
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
Beginning days and yeah

670
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
How much money do they take out

671
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
I think I first got

672
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,904
7000 and then I think it was 20 some odd thousand

673
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
Yeah that was a lot of money for them and I remember my mom

674
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,400
Looking really really scared and saying you know what if you don't pay me back

675
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,824

50 employees

746
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,808
And they were still making all of their own products but realized

747
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,672
They wanted to scale-up they would have to start doing things a little differently

748
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
There was a moment

749
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
I think around 1985

750
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:06,912
When the person who was working in reception came and said there's somebody here to see you

751
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
And

752
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
The person

753
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Was coming to see us

754
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Manufacturing

755
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,336
Company in Taiwan

756
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
And it was the first product

757
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
We saw

758
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
That was being built

759
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
In Asia

760
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
And

761
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
It looked pretty good

762
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Football

763
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,160
It was a parallel printer cable

764
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,488
To go from the IBM PC to a parallel printer

765
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
And I asked him

766
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
What it would cost to buy

767
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
And the price he quoted

768
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Was less expensive

769
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Then what

770
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
Cost us two

771
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
Bill.

772
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
Same item ourselves

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
So that moment was a pretty scary movie

774
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Scary because

775
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Precious

776
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Exactly right

777
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,344
And it appeared to me just instantly in that moment

778
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,696
That we were going to have to start thinking more globally about how we would

779
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Manufacture things

780
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
And

781
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
I didn't know if I had

782
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Permission to do that

783
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
It's hard growing up in this household

784
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,752
That them had appreciated things being made in the US

785
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
That's why I went to see my dad

786
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
I brought this

787
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
Cable

788
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
Just sort of explain to him what we just talked about

789
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
And I just got it paused

790
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
They said

791
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah you need to explore it and if it makes sense

792
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
You've got to do it

793
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Why why did you think you needed his

794
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Commissioned it sounds like

795
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,768
What was it that you needed his sort of approval that you were

796
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Going to make it outside the US

797
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
Permission of me with your company

798
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Yeah

799
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Yasso

800
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:48,288
It would be an emotional or spiritual permission that

801
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
I wasn't violating

802
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Anything that

803
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
My mom or he had stood for and then it was just going to be okay with them and stand up

804
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,576
Approval to say it's okay I did

805
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
I did

806
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
I certainly wanted it was certainly easier with

807
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Remember this is as a kid it's hard to believe now but like

808
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
Made in Taiwan

809
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Mandisa mean it was cheap

810
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,704
Taiwan Japan Korea very very high quality

811
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,264
And of course it's happening with China and

812
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Not another country

813
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,848
Asia

814
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
Like did you fly to Taiwan and find a factory worker

815
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:33,088
Yes I think the phenomenon you speak of happened you know very very rapidly I'm at least from you

816
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Grass perspective I mean all that

817
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,952
Is part of what we were living in real a Time

818
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
And yeah

819
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
I did exactly what it is you said I just

820
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Hopped on a plane so

821
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
I went to three places

822
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
2 Explorer

823
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,008
What might be taking place in the developing world

824
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
So I went to Taiwan

825
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
I went to China

826
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
And I went to India

827
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
And would

828
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
Set alarm so we were still manufacturing most of our things in the US it was very

829
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
Critical to us that we

830
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,512
Maintain all of our Innovation or invention our design so

831
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
So the bulk of what it is we do is still done in the us but we began to

832
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
2

833
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,032
Learn about extending some of our Global Manufacturing

834
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
In China

835
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
And yeah I

836
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
I literally physically

837
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
Help to set up some of our initial manufacturing lines

838
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
So what does that mean

839
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
For I mean

840
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Did that

841
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Decision

842
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Result

843
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Explosive growth

844
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
For Belkin

845
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,048
It put us in a really enviable place

846
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
By that

847
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Point

848
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,776
We were still doing the bulk of the manufacturing in the US and that gave us very rapid Turner

849
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Around

850
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
But now we could also do high volume

851
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
A Tesla cost

852
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
Anyone else was doing

853
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
Anywhere

854
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
So

855
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Because we

856
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
We were a little bit early there was

857
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
An advantage that

858
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,880
That everybody else

859
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,720
Didn't have and those were very very good craft beers for us

860
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
So

861
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
By 1990

862
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
Yumove Falcon headquarters

863
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
To Compton

864
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
California this is

865
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
Sr the lack of height of the gang wars

866
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
Compton was

867
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Popularized

868
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Hip Hop

869
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
Unwrapping

870
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
A year later you've got

871
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
The LA riot

872
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
In South Central mainly in South Central LA

873
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
Tell me why you had decided in 91

874
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
To move

875
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Bedquarters

876
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Yeah there were a few motivating factor

877
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
When was we were moving to

878
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
Bigger and bigger buildings

879
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,912
And there simply weren't that many of them available

880
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,240
To real estate was less expensive

881
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
I had

882
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Spent

883
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,896
And continue to spend a lot of time doing community

884
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Service work

885
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,992
And that was mostly with youth and it was mostly

886
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
With at-risk youth

887
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Chinese very

888
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Comfortable in these communities

889
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
In addition to being comfortable

890
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
Felt a reward

891
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,560
From being able to invest in these areas

892
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
And that worked out very well

893
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
When you have the

894
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Peebles

895
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
End

896
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
The anger

897
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Connected to the verdict of a Rodney

898
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Hanging

899
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Results of Lotto

900
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Fingering

901
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
ABC violence

902
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
What do you remember

903
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
About that time were you

904
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,832
Real work that day were you in Compton

905
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
Yeah I have so many memories of that day

906
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
I remember

907
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
As the civil unrest

908
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,816
Started to accelerate

909
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
I was at work

910
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
And on the drive home

911
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
From the freeway we could see

912
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,312
They are fires across south of LA

913
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
And then the next day

914
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
There was a little bit of

915
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
Thought and discussion about

916
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,320
Whether or not we should be open and to go to work and and we chose to be open

917
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
We're in very close contact with

918
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Little Compton police

919
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
Department saying hey we think it's important for us to be here and

920
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
Adjust remote

921
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Normalcy

922
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
And we'd call in to the police department every hour and now we can start to see fires out the back door of

923
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Falcon

924
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
And

925
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,128
First the feedback was hey it's all fine you don't have anything to worry about

926
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
Hey it's getting pretty active around here

927
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,296
Hey you guys should think about what you're doing to the left

928
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Call we made

929
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
I think the quote

930
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
From the

931
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
Compton police official picked up the phone was

932
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
Get the hell out of Dodge

933
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
And I think that was Private 2 in the afternoon or something like that so we worked with all of our people and

934
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Safest ways to get home

935
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
And that night I'm at home I'm watching the news and more and more buildings are burning and if

936
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
I feel this overwhelming desire to go to work

937
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
The things are okay

938
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
My wife

939
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,576
Convince me that that was probably not a smart thing to I do

940
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
So yeah

941
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
You know it was really scary time I

942
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
Had a lot of mixed emotions I can

943
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Really feel

944
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
For people that

945
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,656
Felt that they were being marginalized and didn't feel

946
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
A part of the system and not being

947
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Heard

948
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
And

949
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,848
The very next day or the day after that

950
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
What time is it

951
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,944
What are the branches of the LA YMCA in

952
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Very active

953
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Wesley Theory why

954
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,808
Volunteer staff

955
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
Person in a board member and

956
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,464
Right in the heart of that community at Weingartz

957
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,048
That we just immediately started leaning and and

958
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,656
Reinvesting in and doing everything we could to

959
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
Start building bridges again

960
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Did you ever

961
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Have any

962
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Invincible

963
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
To come to work with

964
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
With your dog in because

965
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
You know because Contin

966
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
Canada reputation is as

967
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Tough place

968
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
It's a dangerous place

969
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,136
So I was always super comfortable there

970
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
Anybody that was working there I think was

971
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
Comfortable there

972
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
2

973
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,608
I start to get an increasing amount of feedback from the organization that

974
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
When we are

975
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,704
Recruiting people some of the people of got

976
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Simon concerned about

977
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Well they be able to get

978
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
To and from work

979
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,128
Safely and are the amenities around there

980
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,200
I'm safe and my early attitude was

981
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
You know

982
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
All of this work

983
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
The more that were

984
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
Completely integrated in every way that

985
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
Requiem can imagine the better off all of us are I'm going to be

986
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
We did eventually choose

987
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Remove

988
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
We're in a very established Tech hub

989
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
At the Western end of town of LA mayor at the

990
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,448
Time there also was a part of getting us the movie witch

991
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
Just trying to get us in into la

992
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
But the

993
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
There's a big big

994
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Pisa made that

995
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Message being there

996
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
I think he has moved out of Compton in 2000

997
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
For quite a while

998
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
We were

999
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
So just respect

1000
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Then a bit

1001
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
Ever think that

1002
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
First-time Belkin took outside financing

1003
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
2002

1004
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,256
Up until that point

1005
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
It was entirely self financed

1006
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
But started it in the garage and

1007
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
You know you never took any money

1008
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Except for the loan from your mom and dad when Williams

1009
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Thunder

1010
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
Why did you take

1011
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
Outside financing

1012
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
At that point.

1013
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
When did you need it to grow into scale

1014
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
Yeah so we were beginning to see around that time that while

1015
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
At that time

1016
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,343
We were extremely well capitalized.

1017
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,391
Balance sheet was great

1018
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
We could start to see a time in the future

1019
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
To get to a bigger scale

1020
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
That

1021
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
We would absolutely need outside capital

1022
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
So we made a conscious choice

1023
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
On that day because we didn't need it

1024
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
But we figured that the day would come that we

1025
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
What needed

1026
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Man died that that would be a great time to Kanab

1027
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,431
Kind of start to learn

1028
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
At this point like by the time we hit the turn of the Millennium Falcon

1029
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
You know you guys start

1030
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,647
Of course you moved out of just cables you move into

1031
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,231
Huge product line of mouses keyboard laptop

1032
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Case of surge protector

1033
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,375
Power supplies all kinds of USB products going over your website today

1034
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Tons and tons and tons

1035
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
How how are you able to

1036
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,311
How to stay ahead of

1037
00:42:54,335 --> 00:43:00,479
Editor's because I can go on Amazon today and buy the same table made by Amazon

1038
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,319
100 different companies are offering very similar cables

1039
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
How are you guys able to stay ahead of

1040
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Those

1041
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
Competitors

1042
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
Yasso

1043
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
We're really fortunate in that

1044
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
Our reason for being

1045
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
Just as we were first

1046
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,703
Imagining what this organization and this brand could be

1047
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,823
Is almost exactly the same as our reason for being now

1048
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
So it's doing the

1049
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Hard

1050
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Complicated

1051
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
Innovation and Engineering work

1052
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
That allows these

1053
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:37,087
Interfaces to a work together with

1054
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
One another

1055
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,695
For thirty some odd years

1056
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
More often than not

1057
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
We've been able to do that

1058
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,887
In a little bit better or more elegant way than other folks

1059
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
And

1060
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
As long as we're able

1061
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
To keep doing it

1062
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
We're going to do okay

1063
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:02,431
But we are only as good as as how well we are doing things this morning so

1064
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
There's a lot of positive

1065
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Apresurado

1066
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,319
Because the moment we are not best as is the day that the

1067
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
We will be at greater risk

1068
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:15,487
So I guess in the past year in 2018

1069
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Dell Consulting

1070
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Subsidiary

1071
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
The fox tan

1072
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
Play called a fight

1073
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
4

1074
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
Reportedly more than 800 million dollar

1075
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,543
I think you were the primary owner and

1076
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Shareholder of Belkin

1077
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Was a part of your reluctant

1078
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
Do that because

1079
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
I have to assume that

1080
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,551
That would mean the end of your time at Belk and which was your in

1081
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
Higher identity

1082
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Why would you have a role in a cup

1083
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Play today

1084
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Yap so

1085
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
I'm still

1086
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Running Belkin

1087
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
And the folks said fit you've been kind and gracious enough to allow me

1088
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,471
A2im have an expanded role inside of f i d

1089
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:02,079
Combination of v and Belkin has created a company doing

1090
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
4 + 1/2

1091
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Billion dollars

1092
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
Revenue a year

1093
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
So

1094
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
This is nothing about

1095
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
Ending any kind of

1096
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,807
Chapter but rather

1097
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
Azzam Oliver chapters has been

1098
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,487
What are the actions we take what do we do to put us in the best possible place

1099
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
To do our best work going forward

1100
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
That is what this is all about this is

1101
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
This is an enabler

1102
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
Conversation I had with

1103
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Haim Saban

1104
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
A couple

1105
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Beers ago and I asked him about

1106
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
Well then I said was it important

1107
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
To you

1108
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Early on

1109
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
To become

1110
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Wealthy and his answer was interesting

1111
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
Was but not because of the

1112
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Actual money but

1113
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
The money was a marker

1114
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Success form

1115
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Make so I wanted to make more

1116
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
Because to me that was a marker

1117
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Very poor

1118
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
What was earning money

1119
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
A lot of money

1120
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Important

1121
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,239
Do you is a marker in that way especially given how you grew up

1122
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,079
Yeah I I can really relate to that

1123
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
So definitely an important thing that

1124
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,943
That what it is we're doing matters

1125
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,343
But another measurement of success has how many people want this and

1126
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
And so yeah Financial results out of an organization is is one way to sort of measure what

1127
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Whether or not you're being successful

1128
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
I think also for me as a kid

1129
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
I doubt this experience with my parents that I

1130
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:39,103
Wasn't sure if they had a lot kind of set aside to give them a little bit of wiggle room when

1131
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,455
And things got a little leaner so I think I did set out to make sure that

1132
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
That was less likely to be the case for me but

1133
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
That particular issue probably got solved

1134
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
A little while ago

1135
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Your mom and dad

1136
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Lived

1137
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
I no longer live

1138
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Both of them

1139
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
They did live long enough to see

1140
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
You

1141
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
Successful very successful in fact

1142
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Obviously you paid their loan back

1143
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
What do they make of it

1144
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,151
Did they ever talk to you about it reflect on it with you

1145
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,991
They really felt I think a lot of

1146
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Ownership

1147
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
Because they were able to park

1148
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,647
Participate in various ways in those early days my mom is making

1149
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
You know breakfast lunch or dinner for everybody that was

1150
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,559
Working there they lent money to the business

1151
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
My dad helped

1152
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,423
To build so much of the tooling am hung out there

1153
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
And so yeah I think that they fell

1154
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
A lot of pride

1155
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
But they off

1156
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
They are always worried

1157
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
So I would hear feedback

1158
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
From my friends

1159
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
And people that worked at belcan

1160
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,111
We're both my mom and my dad would pull people often

1161
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
I didn't say

1162
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Hey

1163
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Is Chet doing okay

1164
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,303
And it said yeah yeah I think he's doing okay

1165
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,143
So they felt a lot of pride a lot of reward but

1166
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,703
But I think they I'm always worried and

1167
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,031
And maybe that's just a little bit of what Mom and Dad to do

1168
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
How much of your

1169
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
Success to you tribute to lock

1170
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
And how much do tribute to

1171
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
Your intelligence and skill and

1172
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
I attributed to

1173
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
Mostly other people

1174
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
There's nothing

1175
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
That I could have accomplished

1176
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:35,071
With them out a bunch of other people making great things happen if it wasn't for my teachers

1177
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Wouldn't be here

1178
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
If it wasn't for my mom and dad

1179
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:44,543
I wouldn't be here my brother I don't think I'd be here a thousand people

Making things happen every day and you know more than anything else it's because of of the work

1182
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
Other people that I have been able to do what little that I've done

That's Champion founder of Falcon the official name of the company is Belkin International

1184
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
Incorporated that also sells networking products under the Linksys brand Witchduck in the choir.

1185
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
Play we didn't get into this during our interview but the first really successful product red hat

1186
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,343
1983 was a connector called the Belkin Hamlet he was protecting the Apple II

1187
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
To see computer to different types of printers and the name Hamlet

1188
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:42,143

Hey thanks for sticking around

1202
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,967
How you built that

1203
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,527
And this is a story about something we

1204
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,575
Almost never think about

1205
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
Until It Breaks

1206
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:40,767
The common everyday zipper the moment of oh my God my backpack just split open

1207
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
Turn on me and I'm on a trip and Central America play McCabe and he's kind of an expert

1208
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
Broken zippers because he's got hundreds of stories I have a musician that was getting ready for show and his

1209
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
Zippered blown-out on his pants you known he was

1210
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:03,295
I mean who wants to go play a show in front of thousands of people with your pants unzipped

1211
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,599
Window zippers break

1212
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
Throw the item away in the trash

1213
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,511
Even if it's your favorite pair of jeans or the backpack that's been everywhere with you

1214
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,095
But this is not the way clay was raised

1215
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,447
When was a kid in McCall Idaho his dad had a repair shopping

1216
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
He would fix everything

1217
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
Everyday there is somebody could come into the shop

1218
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
And have a broken zipper

1219
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:32,223
Keep fix it in about 5 minutes and actually Clay's dad built us

1220
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Give me the

1221
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Kit for people

1222
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,879
So they could repair their zippers at home so it's just kind of a fool

1223
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
Do-it-yourself kit that had

1224
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,743
Handful of different Sliders in them

1225
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
Which is it that's the little metal piece that you grab onto a slider is the thing that can break or fall off a zipper

1226
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,263
It was like a little bag that had a bunch of different types of the slider

1227
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,895
And it also have these little Stapley things for attaching the slider back to the zipper teeth

1228
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,223
Anyway all this is happening back in the early 1990s

1229
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,623
Clay's dad put the repair kits on a very basic website and started to sell them in a few chain stores

1230
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
So that was kind of like

1231
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Supporting our whole family

1232
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,303
Pretty pretty much you noses it was a meager living but it was enough to get a spy

1233
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,095
Things got harder after

1234
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
Clay's dad died

1235
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,959
Is mom took over the business but she had a hard time keeping it up

1236
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
Show about 5 years ago

1237
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Why you decided to take it over

1238
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
Cuz it didn't feel finish to me

1239
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,711
You know it felt like there was a lot more potential and what he had started then what was

1240
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
Currently there

1241
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,295
But in order to tap into that potential

1242
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,623
Play decided the whole look and feel of the business

1243
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
Had to change

1244
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,439
The old website was like

1245
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,767
It was straight out of the 90s

1246
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
You know it's almost got this

1247
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,119
Important words like so retro is cool again

1248
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,703
A complete rebranding of his dad zipper rescue

1249
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:01,823
Updated the website design logo and then he started to

1250
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
Gladden shake the trees a little you know things started happening immediately it was like okay I landed us a new account here

1251
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
Aaron started to Cana

1252
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,623
Get a handle on what was going on with Amazon and how you know how it all worked

1253
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,439
Actually once you get the kid on Amazon

1254
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
Clay had to deal with a wave of knock-offs

1255
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,047
Says one thing he offers

1256
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
The other guys don't

1257
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:27,423
Customer service in fact he takes a lot of the calls himself

1258
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495
And helping other people repair their own zippers

1259
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
It's become one of his favorite parts of the job

1260
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,895
It becomes so meaningful when you're helping somebody fix something that's just

1261
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,943
Literally Irreplaceable

1262
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,343
You know it kind of gets me through my days like if I'm having a hard day and I get that called some cute old lady

1263
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,207
He knows how to Southern lady be like you walk on water who is so happy

3 Mile Clee it's pretty happy that the money side of the business is looking good to you.

1266
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:03,007
Getting to the point where like a six-figure profit margin is like insight

1267
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,823
