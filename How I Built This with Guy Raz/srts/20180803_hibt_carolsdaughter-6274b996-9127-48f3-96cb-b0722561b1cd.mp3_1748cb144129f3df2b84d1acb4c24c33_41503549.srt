Isn't she was almost

13
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,040
Blindsided by her own idea I mean

14
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,344
When she first started making skin care products

15
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
She was putting them in the

16
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
Baby food jars and just selling them to friends at church

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
She did not

18
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Think about

19
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,304
Turning it into a huge business

It started out as a pet

74
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Because Lisa already

75
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Pretty cool

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,112
In the 1980s

77
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Cosby Show

Which

79
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Time of course

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Wasn't get tarnished

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Because of Bill Cosby

82
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
It was the hottest

83
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
TV show

84
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
In America

85
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,472
I thought that I had found the career that I was going to do for the rest of my life because

86
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
It was amazing

87
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,128
Experience it was particularly incredible being you know what

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
An African American woman

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
And

90
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
What that show

91
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Meant to me and my family

92
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
To see

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
African American

94
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Did in

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
You know such a

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Positive light so it was something that

97
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
For me to be standing in the Huxtable kitchen

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,656
The morning of my first table read as I'm listening to

99
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Do the cast read the script

100
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Why I could have just

101
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
Float it off I mean

102
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Presumably

103
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
You know

104
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
I guess looking for the outside one would think

105
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
This is going to be a career

106
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
Like this is what you're going to do with your life but that is not what

107
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,368
No it's not I could have gone on to Venice script supervisor

108
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
Production coordinator associate producer

109
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Perhaps on the on the

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Operational side of things

111
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
And if that is what I thought

112
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
I was going to be happy

113
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
I was

114
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Ecstatic is Wonder

115
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
And I think

116
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Because I was

117
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
Very happy

118
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
At what I was doing with work

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
When I had my downtime

120
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
I'm and I was not at work

121
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
I didn't have that desperate feeling that you

122
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
You feel

123
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
When you're like oh God I'm finally not at work and I just want to relax

124
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
I just want to veg out you know

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
So I've became creative when I was at home

126
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
How did the idea to

127
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Start making beauty products

128
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Even occur to you

129
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Well what

130
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Initially happy

131
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
Happened was I'm a huge Prince fan and have been for many years

132
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,407
And I read an article about him and in that article

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,783
They talked about how he always smells very good and the reason for it was

134
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
He kept

135
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
An assortment of fragrances on his bureau

136
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,463
And it was also rumored that he put

137
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
Chanel Number 5 in his boots

138
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
So that whenever he took off his boots

139
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,959
He didn't have to worry about his feet not smelling good wow I could I could see

140
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Princeton

141
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
So

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,127
I just love this idea of this blending of fragrances

143
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
In creating these unique fat but you weren't thinking about the

144
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
Business no not at all

145
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Like just to do for me

146
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
And that's what I began to

147
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
To do I learned that the way that your fragrance last

148
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
On your body

149
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Is you layer it

150
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
So you wash with it you

151
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Moisturize with it then you Spritz it on

152
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
So then I said well I don't I don't have moisturizers that

153
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
It smell like this where am I going to get that

154
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
And

155
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
At first I started

156
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
Using lotions that I could get at the drugstore and I would put

157
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
Fragrances into them

158
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
And and blended it it didn't work

159
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
That that was a

160
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
You know balanced from a chemistry

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
Prospective so things would just separate and be kind of messy

162
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
And that led me into

163
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Looking into

164
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Possibly making my own

165
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
And one day I walked

166
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Consider this like

167
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
New Age kind of

168
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Bookstore

169
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
And there was a book

170
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
Are essential oils and the Art of perfumery

171
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
And in that book

172
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
War basic

173
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Recipes

174
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
PS4

175
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
I massage oil or cream or balm

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
So then I thought this

177
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
This is great I can make my own lotion

178
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
And

179
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,135
You know the recipes were very like barebones than

180
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
You know they use things like paraffin and lanolin which I wasn't too

181
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Crazy about you saying I

182
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
I wanted to use

183
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
Beeswax in I wanted to find

184
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Cocoa butter

185
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,751
I used the the skeleton of the recipe with in the book

186
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
And then I just started adding

187
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,431
My own combinations and tweak it you know if something came out runny or too thick or

188
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Too oily or too stiff

189
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
So you are like a

190
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
Literally melting down cocoa butter on your stovetop and I'm like

191
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
Mixing oils together and then

192
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Sing what came out

193
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Yes

194
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,631
That's how you make body butter right you start to melt a bunch of stuff and mix it together

195
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Yeah I mean

196
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
Today you couldn't get old going

197
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
YouTube DIY videos and and get a good head start but

198
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
He just kind of had to figure it out

199
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,967
This was this was like what that the late 80s or the early 90s

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
That was the late 80s

201
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
I began selling

202
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
Because I had actually gotten something

203
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
That

204
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
You don't look

205
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Good and work

206
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,303
And my mother encouraged me to sell at a church flea market

207
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
In May of 93 when she was she was saying

208
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Lisa this stuff is pretty good like your

209
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
You should sell this people might buy it

210
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
That that is

211
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,871
Pretty much verbatim witch

212
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271
There you go I did not say I said really mommy do you think people would pay for this

213
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
And she said yes she said your Butters are good that you know my skin looks great and she was using it on my little brother

214
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Sisters and

215
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
You know she said I think you should try and I remember saying to my mom I said Mom what am I going to put them in because

216
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Cuz I just would give it to friends and family so I put it in tupperware Rubbermaid you don't

217
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Think about a jar

218
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
And she said well we could use recycled baby

219
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Food jars

220
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,735
I'm cuz my mom had adopted my baby sister Torah

221
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
Very recently so she had lots of baby

222
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
Baby food jars well and we you know boil them on the stove like how used to sanitize bottles

223
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Back in the day

224
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
I put the cream in the baby food jars and made my labels by hand and I took them out to that flea

225
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Market and I sold out

226
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Wow what did you what did you call them

227
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
I called the company Carol's daughter I did have

228
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
A name

229
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
And

230
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
I called it Carol's Daughter

231
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Because that's literally who I was

232
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Is my mom with Carol and I were

233
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Was her daughter

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,903
And the products that I sold I called them fragrant moisture butter

235
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
At the time

236
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,535
So you show me the screen Market by the way you are still a writer's assistant on The Cosby Show

237
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Dislike your weekend

238
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Side Hustle

239
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
No by 93

240
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Cosby had ended

241
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
And I

242
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
I thought I was a freelance

243
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Person

244
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
But it was summer

245
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
Television typically in New York

246
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Was very slow

247
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
In the summer months

248
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
Because you your season would end in May

249
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
And your new season wouldn't begin until

250
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
I'm so unless you were working on a pilot

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
You were probably off

252
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
During the summer

253
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
And that first summer

254
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Of

255
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
Starting at that Flea Market at the end of May

256
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
I spent most of that summer

257
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Making money

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
Selling at different craft fairs and Expos

259
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Some things like that

260
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
And I went back

261
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
To work that

262
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
What did you

263
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
How much money did you have to put into

264
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Like watch this

265
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
That very first

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
Flea market honestly was an investment of $100

267
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,599
Between you know whatever the table rental was in

268
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
The ingredients that I had

269
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,719
The purchase to fill the baby food jars that I had and

270
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Maybe some flowers yunnan

271
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
How to decorate my table

272
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
And what I did

273
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
I just

274
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Khepri invest

275
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Because I didn't

276
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Have

277
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,799
Money that I could say oh well I'm just going to go pull 10000 out of my savings

278
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
To start this business

279
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
So it was something that started in a very small way of very organic way

280
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
And I didn't

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Do anything that I couldn't afford to do

282
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
So if someone told me about an expo

283
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
In Georgia

284
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
That's fantastic and the fee to get in it's only $5,000

285
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
I wasn't going there

286
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
But a table

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
You know in Park Slope for 35 bucks okay

288
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
What who is who who are you

289
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
Customers in that first summer

290
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
They were mostly African-American women that you know where in the different neighborhoods that I was in

291
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
And I did have some customers who weren't African-American but for the most part that's who would come to my table

292
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
I was not deliberately

293
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
Who sang this is for African-American women I was deliberately saying this is for dry skin and subsequently

294
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
When you have more melanin in your skin

295
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
That dry skin will show

296
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
You look dull you look it up

297
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
As people say

298
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Ashy

299
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
And you cannot get away from that

300
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
That's how I probably at that time

301
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Ended up

302
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
With that audience

303
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Of people

304
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Who were more Brown

305
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Because they found something

306
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
That took away that Ash

307
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
So if you if you

308
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
If you are African American women in the early 1990s

309
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
Essentially there was very few options it is really

310
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Few companies that were serving

311
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Arawaks

312
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Yes

313
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Very few

314
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
There was definitely

315
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
A community that needed to be served

316
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Who was not nest

317
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Sara Lee being

318
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
King served

319
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
It was it was not something

320
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
That you could walk into a drugstore and

321
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
And say oh look at that

322
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Is fantastic great

323
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
It wasn't there

324
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
It is now but it wasn't then

325
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
So that summer of 93 when you were like selling

326
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
Body butter in baby jars

327
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
Church flea markets

328
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Did you think of this as you know azure

329
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Your future

330
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,239
Just thinking this is a fun little side project hang out with people I know and

331
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
I'm having fun

332
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
At first

333
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
I thought about it as

334
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
And then

335
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Of that summer

336
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
I was watching an episode of the Oprah win

337
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,807
Official and she was talking to

338
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Two people who had started businesses

339
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
With little or no money

340
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
One person said well

341
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
You have to know that you're passionate

342
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
About what you do you

343
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
You can't start a business just because

344
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
You want to make

345
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
A bunch of money

346
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,495
Because it's going to take too long for you to make any money and if you're not passionate about it you will quit

347
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Before you make any money

348
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
And I remember thinking

349
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,663
I'm really passionate about this stuff like I I like

350
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
I like doing this

351
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
And then somebody else said

352
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
She would Define passion as

353
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
If someone woke you up out of your bed in the middle of the night

354
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Would you go and do this thing

355
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
And I honestly could answer yes to that question and I'm someone who is very fond of sleeping and

356
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
My love

357
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
A good you know lately we've been kind of thing and I realized yeah I would get up out of bed to do this because I really

358
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
You do enjoy it

359
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
And

360
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
I remember sitting on the edge of my bed and saying wait a minute

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Maybe this is

362
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
This could be a business

363
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
And

364
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
That day was the day that I realized

365
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
This just

366
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Doesn't have

367
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
To be a hobby this can be more

368
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,559
All right so that first summer ends and you go back to a job and

369
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
And what happens to to the business to Carol's Daughter

370
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
It continues to grow

371
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
People

372
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Call

373
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
And say Hey you know that I bought a jar cream from you

374
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
You know what such a

375
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Can such street

376
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
State Fair

377
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
And I'm running out how can I get some more and I would look at

378
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,855
Get my schedule and you know if I knew I was going to be

379
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Be home on a

380
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Saturday as well

381
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
If you want to come by my apartment on Saturday I'll be

382
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,559
Be home I'm working the rest of the week but I'll be home on Saturday what time would you like

383
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
To come by

384
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
And that was

385
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
The beginning

386
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Of people coming and shopping

387
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
In my

388
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Apartment

389
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
And and that

390
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Continue to grow

391
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
To the point where sometimes I would

392
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
I would come home

393
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Tenacity Massachusetts

394
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
Someone didn't know that it wasn't an actual store

395
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
You know they heard about it from a

396
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
My friend and you don't answer

397
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
At home

398
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
So at this point

399
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,023
How did you get the word out about Carol's Daughter be

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Because initially you are

401
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Flea markets in MA

402
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Rights for talking but how did you

403
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Get more people to know about it

404
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,799
You know my my husband calls this the sister girl net worth

405
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,639
It was literally one woman telling another woman

406
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
And somebody

407
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Always brought a friend

408
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
With them

409
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
And if you brought a friend

410
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Do you know get a free gift

411
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Doritos

412
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Tell something off

413
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
It was all of that grass

414
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Type of stuff

415
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
And

416
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
If I was out

417
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,279
Selling somewhere and someone asked me

418
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
About something

419
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
If I didn't know how to make it I figured out how to make

420
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
So I learned how to make bath salts I learned how to make

421
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Body scrubs

422
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Different types of moisturizer

423
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
There is I figured out how to make shampoo how to make

424
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Conditioner

425
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
And it was it was just experimenting the way

426
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
You would experiment cooking

427
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
And what did you decide to

428
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Leave TV and just

429
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Do this full-time

430
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
I left television in 1996

431
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,023
Because my son forest was due to be born April 5th

432
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Of that year

433
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
And

434
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
I realize that

435
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
If I continue to work

436
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
I would

437
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Basically just give my paycheck to a baby

438
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah so it just

439
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Logically made sense

440
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
To let the job go

441
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
And see if

442
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
In being at home full-time while taking care of a baby

443
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
Could the business grow enough

444
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
We also at the same

445
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Time

446
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
We were able to

447
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
To change

448
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
How and where we live

449
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
So my aunt and uncle were

450
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Selling their home

451
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
They were selling it to someone else

452
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
And

453
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
I think there was

454
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Three tries

455
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
Ice at the closing and it just didn't happen

456
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
And I finally worked up the nerve

457
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
To ask

458
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Is there any way that we can

459
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Could purchase your home

460
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
And we did it and

461
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
So forest with

462
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Osborne

463
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
March 18th of 96

464
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,951
And May 22nd of 96 we moved into

465
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
The home that we live in today

466
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
And it enabled us to

467
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
You don't have the space that we needed with a baby but also have

468
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Space for the business to grow

469
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
And that was

470
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
That was a big Turning Point

471
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
You know it was

472
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Huge difference

473
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
So many people coming in on Saturdays to shop

474
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
You know there was a time where you would be like oh hi Diane hi Susie hi Charles

475
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
And that was like I don't know any of

476
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
I never met you

477
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
The voice mailbox would fill up every hour and a half

478
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
My husband and I would you no wait

479
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,191
When did you last check the photo I checked it at 2:30 oh my God it's five

480
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
You don't let me get me a pen and paper

481
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
And if you just

482
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
You just look at it and you and you can't

483
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
You can't believe it Lisa Price

485

How I mention from Oprah

486
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
Crashed her company's website

518

Gyros

519
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
Definitely should have started to focus on Carol's Daughter

520
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Full-time

521
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Things started to take off

522
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Pretty fast

523
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,711
What was the turning point when did you when did something happen

524
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Where you sat

525
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
This is like

526
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Bedtime

527
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Well because I've been in business

528
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
For 24 years

529
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
And because

530
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Turning Point

531
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
And

532
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Success

533
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
And

534
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
You know those aha moments

535
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Are very

536
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Relative

537
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Fluid there's been

538
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Several of those

539
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
So you know there was there was

540
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,335
The moment when my second son Ennis was born

541
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
I was in the hospital

542
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,015
I'm after having given birth and my husband walks into the hospital with

543
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Essence magazine

544
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
And I was in the November issue

545
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
And I actually had a half-page article with a picture

546
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
And my name

547
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Which was a really big deal

548
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
How did they know about it

549
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
There there were Beauty editors that lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood where I live

550
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
So

551
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,335
They were always in search of something different

552
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,663
And then because I work in television production

553
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
For so long and then my husband

554
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Continue to in

555
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
And still does

556
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
I would have access to

557
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
2 makeup artist

558
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
And hair stylist

559
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
And

560
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
If they

561
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
You know went on another production

562
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,560
They could reach out to me and I let you know I could send it to them

563
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
I remember hearing that

564
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,448
Edie Falco love demoisturizer of mine because

565
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
A makeup artist that I worked with on his show

566
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Shared it with

567
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Get out and I was like

568
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Jackie Chan

569
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,736
I've never met Edie Falco to this day but she she loved one of my moisture

570
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Wow so so bye

571
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,368
1999 you guys were able to open up like an actual ShopRite

572
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Yes

573
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,696
The first store that was not in my house

574
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,256
Brick-and-mortar retail space

575
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
They said had windows and a door

576
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
And

577
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
The landlord

578
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
Wanted the space to be something

579
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Elf

580
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
And I sent him a gift basket

581
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
For his wife

582
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Ana Package

583
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
With a letter about the bread

584
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
To convince him

585
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
That

586
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
My shop would be great

587
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
And that location

588
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
And because

589
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Of my letter

590
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,648
He decided that he was going to give me a shot and he wanted to meet with me to go over

591
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
What's terms

592
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,024
So I'm sitting in this meeting feeling so Victorious I've convinced this guy that

593
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
You know my business is what he wants

594
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Put in here

595
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
He's so he said so

596
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
The terms of pretty basic I'm going to need

597
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
4 month deposit on the rent

598
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,872
And Baba and he's like talking other things and I'm quickly adding in my head

599
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
And I'm like that's 14

600
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Okay that's 14000

601
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
It's $14,000

602
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Yeah

603
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
I have no clue

604
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,184
Where are we going to get $14,000

605
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
And dumb

606
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
It worked out

607
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,144
We had some small account set up for our sons for their college

608
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,264
And we took it you know my my boys were very very young

609
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
You know we took

610
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,664
It up between their two accounts aye I don't know something like $3,500

611
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Out of the bank

612
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
And then one of my aunts

613
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Loaned me

614
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,624
Little bit more like another four or five thousand dollars

615
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,720
Yeah it worked out it was it was a little little dicey at first

616
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
But it worked out and I paid my aunt back

617
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
Before Christmas

618
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Best of that year it's so incredible to hear how $3,500

619
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
Excruciating excruciating my money when

620
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Of course

621
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
In a within a decade you were going to be doing it

622
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
A hundred million stars

623
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
In in sales but at that time it was scary must have felt really scary

624
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
It was it definitely was

625
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
They think that that made it

626
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
Palatable was

627
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
I knew I couldn't stay in the house

628
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
Like you know you're at your

629
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Bursting at

630
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
It seems and you

631
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
You can't accommodate

632
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,168
People and your neighbors are starting to look at you like what's going on in there this oldies

633
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
People that come in and out everyday

634
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
I mean we were actually watched at one point

635
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
For suspicious activity

636
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,224
Because did you know I was just ringing the bell and going inside and it come out

637
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
With bags like what's going on in there

638
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
And and and

639
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
We found out later when

640
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
You know the police off

641
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Officer came to shop

642
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,768
And she cheetah she was like I just want to let you know cuz you probably didn't know this

643
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
SEL

644
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
Somebody made a phone call and someone was nervous and they

645
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
You don't realize that everything was okay

646
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,240
And there was nothing untoward going on but yeah yeah

647
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
You just get to a point where

648
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
You have to

649
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
To grow up in and you have to take that leap of faith in

650
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
I didn't want to live in

651
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
Well what if I had gotten the store

652
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
What if I had

653
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
What if you digest

654
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
And I would rather have had

655
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
At the store

656
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Fail

657
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,720
Then to have wondered what

658
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
What did your mom think about

659
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
That store that first dortmund

660
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Her name was was in the Marquee

661
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
What you think what you walked in there

662
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,592
She she she loved it but it but I will I will tell you the moment that she was like

663
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Really excited about

664
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
The business being

665
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Carol's Daughter

666
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
I got to do the Oprah Winfrey show

667
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
In 2002

668
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
And so she got to

669
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
See that

670
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
You know to see her daughter

671
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
On Oprah

672
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
And

673
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
All of her friends got

674
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
To see that

675
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
And

676
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,912
The place where she went where she would get her blood work done on a regular basis with

677
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
This Medical Center in Brooklyn called The Hip Center

678
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
At what was she what she say

679
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Yes

680
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,336
With an illness called polymyositis

681
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,456
So when she came to get her blood work done after that Oprah Winfrey show

682
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
Ole Miss Carol was so happy to see you here come right in. The so-and-so is waiting for you

683
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
And then I'm going to take you down to the lab as soon as you're done

684
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
She said she was in and out of there so fast

685
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
She told me she's

686
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376

Keep going on television I could get you

688
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
How did how did Oprah find out about you

689
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
Through the magazines and and the attention you were getting there

690
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,384
Getting me on to the show came through

691
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Douceurs

692
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
And the producers of

693
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
The show heard about me from another producer

694
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Who was interviewing for a job

695
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
She went to Chicago to interview for

696
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Position

697
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
They talked about what they were working on

698
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
One and one of the shows was

699
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
A show about women who it started business

Lisa Price

703
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
And they reached out

704
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,080
They liked what they heard they interviewed me like

705
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
6 *

706
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
A week later I was in Chicago taping

00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Michelle

708
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,736
And I was sitting in the audience

709
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
And

710
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,624
She looked at the screen and she sees the name of the store and she said

711
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Carol's Daughter

712
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,000
Counter I know Carol's Daughter your camels I know,

00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
And I'm sitting here like oh my God Oprah Winfrey knows man I'm going to die

714
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
How did that affect business

715
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
When it when it was on Oprah

716
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,336
It affected it in an amazing way

717
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
We

718
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Pad

719
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Our website

720
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Go from having

721
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
37

722
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
People in it

723
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
And within four minutes

724
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
A segment the audience

725
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
In the website went from

726
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
You know whatever it was 30 something people to 17000

727
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Wow

728
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
The website actually

729
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Crashed

730
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,912
I mean it was remarkable it was just remarkable

731
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
Not anything

732
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Crazy like not what not what p

733
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
People think

734
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
That you know

735
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,432
One day you're on the show and all of a sudden you're a millionaire and money is just falling out of your hands

736
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Not that but definitely ask

737
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Significant

738
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Lift and shift

739
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
In

740
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Who knew about us

741
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
But it was something that was manager

742
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
We didn't implode under

743
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Did the pressure

744
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Basically

745
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
From the moment you open their first store for the next

746
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Decade you guys were dressed

747
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Thomas massive

748
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Grocery

749
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
That you were just like

750
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,824
Growing and growing and growing every year and opening more stores right

751
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,432
Well we didn't open additional stores for a very long time

752
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
I'm I'm I mean I I

753
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
I wouldn't describe it as a massive growth

754
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Factory

755
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
There was growth each year

756
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
But I wouldn't describe it as

757
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
As master

758
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,488
I didn't open up another store until 2000

759
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
5

760
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,096
And in 2004 I took on a business

761
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
His partner

762
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
And then in 2005

763
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Took on invest

764
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
And you guys had some

765
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Some big deal invest

766
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Jay-Z was an investor right

767
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,616
Yes Jay-Z Will Smith

768
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
Jada Pinkett Smith

769
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
And the investment

770
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Help desk

771
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
2

772
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
Open up the additional store

773
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
I'm but also helped us

774
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
To get into

775
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Two places

776
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
Like Sephora at the

777
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Time

778
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,232
And then subsequently Macy's

779
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,816
It helped to build a better infrastructure

780
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,632
You know that there's there's definite

781
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Excitement

782
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,520
You know pride and everything

783
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,616
Sing when you're when you're small and your grass roots and your building

784
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
But they're there comes a point

785
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,528
You know when you start doing a million a million and a half two million two and a half million in

786
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
Sale where

787
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
You can't wing it

788
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
You know like things have to be

789
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Cure

790
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,024
And and that's when investment was definitely needed

791
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Because

792
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
There there was some winning

793
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,680
That was going on and you can only do that for but so long

794
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
At a certain point I mean you guys were

795
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm your revenues were

796
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
You know

797
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
In the tens of millions of dollars when you saw

798
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Those numbers at the end of the year

799
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Was that Strange Fruit

800
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Did you could you have imagined

801
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
That happening I I can definitely

802
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
He say for certain

803
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,904
That I never imagined that happen

804
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
And even to

805
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
This day

806
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
I still

807
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Am amazed by it

808
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
It's still surreal

809
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,936
And that's not something that ever goes

810
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Away

811
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
And I don't mind

812
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,592
That I feel that way because I I think it keeps me grounded

813
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
And it keeps me focused on the work that I do

814
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
Because that never change

815
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Regardless of

816
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
You know

817
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
40 mm in

818
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Sales in a year

819
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Or

820
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
28 million in sales

821
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Elf in a year

822
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
I'm still doing this

823
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Same work

824
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,352
Your mom Carol passed away

825
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
More than a decade ago

826
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
But when she was alive

827
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
What sort of role did she play in

828
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Because I mean she

829
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Did actually get to witness

830
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
She she did she

831
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
She did get to see

832
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
A lot what Mommy

833
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Always

834
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,064
Did for me was she always focused

835
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
On the

836
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Positive

837
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
So if I was calling her

838
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
And saying to her

839
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
You know Mom I don't know how I'm going to get the

840
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
These orders filled by

841
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Christmas

842
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,168
They all have to ship by this date there's just so much I just

843
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Is can't figure out

844
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
How to get it all done

845
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
And she would say

846
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,080
Well actually that's the easy part

847
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
And I said what do you mean

848
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,968
The easy part I just said I don't know how to do it like it's it's really hard

849
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
And she said but what if

850
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
If you didn't have the orders

851
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,136
That seems to me like it would be the harder part

852
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Define make

853
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,256
People be interested and make people purchase she says you have the orders

854
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
You have their credit card number

855
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
As soon as you get the stuff made you'll get the money

856
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
So the money is just sitting there waiting for you

857
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
You so dad seems like it's

858
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Easy she said I think we just need to clear our heads

859
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Figure out

860
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
How to get it all done

861
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
And then she would say something like go make yourself a couple

862
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Petit I'm going to make myself a cup of

863
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Booty call me back I'm going to figure this out

864
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
And I would be like

865
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Is she crazy

866
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
I would go make

867
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
My cup of tea

868
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
And come back to

869
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,232
To the phone and we would talk and I'd sit there with pen and paper

870
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
And we would figure out

871
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
A plan

872
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
And

873
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
I never let that go

874
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,496
I know that in 2014 you sold the company to L'Oreal

875
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Was that

876
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Was that

877
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
Difficult for you to

878
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
Sell this thing that you

879
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Built out of

880
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
Apartment in Brooklyn or

881
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
How did it feel like a weight was lifted up

882
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Beholders I mean that

883
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
United

884
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,976
One of the biggest cosmetic companies in the world buying your company it was not a difficult thing for

885
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
For me to do

886
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,352
At at all except for the fact that the

887
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
Process to get there is death

888
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
So it wasn't

889
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Oh my God I have

890
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Sell my baby

891
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
I can't I can't I can't

892
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
That

893
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Emotion had already happened

894
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Because

895
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
In mm

896
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,784
Seven Carol's daughter took on Equity partners with Pegasus Capital Advisors

897
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
So once you take on an equity

898
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
My partner

899
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Your goal is to

900
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Celtics

901
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,536
Strategic partner and everyone exits Happy Tails

902
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
I'm so

903
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
Having someone like L'Oreal

904
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Acquire the brand

905
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
With something that I knew would happen

906
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
I always had

907
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
L'Oreal at

908
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
The top of my list and it did work out

909
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
And I was

910
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Thrilled

911
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
And proud and

912
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,552
Because for me it was the culmination

913
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Of all of that work that I had

914
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
I do to fix the mistakes that I made

915
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
In my comfort

916
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,488
Not trusting my gut often enough

917
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Not

918
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Valuing

919
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
What I brought

920
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,656
Table and not valuing myself

921
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
As of business

922
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,264
This person and as a smart woman and I had to

923
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Find my voice

924
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Again

925
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
And

926
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
So I got it back

927
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
I felt strong I felt

928
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Power

929
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,528
And I stood with everyone else shoulder to shoulder

930
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
And guided Carol's daughter to that place

931
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,624
For us to have that app

932
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Position so

933
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
I was very very high

934
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
When when L'Oreal bought

935
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Company some of your car

936
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
Customers were disappointed

937
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Because

938
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
He knows pretty I mean you know they felt that well this was

939
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,472
Company owned by African American woman

940
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Now it's somebody that's big

941
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
Multinational

942
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
How did you as you respond to that one when when you heard that

943
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
It didn't take me by surprise that there were

944
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
With some backlash

945
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
I think the only thing that took

946
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
Took me by surprise was that some of the backlash

947
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Was very

948
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Personal

949
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
And very

950
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Acquainted and

951
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Very cruel

952
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
And just speaking about me in

953
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
In ways that I was

954
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
Like how do you say this about somebody that you've never met

955
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
More wow

956
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
That was

957
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Surprising

958
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
But

959
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
What I realized

960
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Was

961
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
People didn't know

962
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
My story

963
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
I realize that as

964
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,712
A group of people within this world African-American people

965
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Historically

966
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
We have left

967
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Experience with generational wealth

968
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
Stream ABC

969
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Successful in certain areas we may have

970
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Become

971
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Rich recently

972
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
But we don't really know what generational wealth

973
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Is

974
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
And we haven't

975
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Come up in families

976
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,960
That have owned and passed down busy

977
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,800
So they were just things that people didn't know

978
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
And they wrote a narrative for me

979
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
On what they felt was appropriate and what they felt

980
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
Was something to be proud of and I didn't follow the script

981
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
And and I apologize for how they felt

982
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
And

983
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,672
And that I didn't follow the script that they wrote

984
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
For me but I used the Opera

985
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
Opportunity and still use it

986
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
To educate asbestos

987
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Is possible

988
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Cuz it's going to take us

989
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,424
Time to build that generational wealth

990
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
And then perhaps

991
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Be in the place

992
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
Will we have the luxury of

993
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Not having to

994
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah because we were able to build it on our own or we were able to build it

995
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
With Mom and Dad

996
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,552
Help and we can stay privately owned but it's going to take time to get there

997
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,856
But it it was

998
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
It was difficult

999
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,256
Sometimes it still is difficult because people still will bring it up and it's it's almost as if

1000
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
I've been asked

1001
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
To apologize

1002
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
For one of the greatest

1003
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Accomplishments of my life

1004
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,472
And something that I'm very very proud of a little girl in

1005
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
From Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn

1006
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,080
You get pretty well yeah pretty well

1007
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
I did I definitely did

1008
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Better

1009
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
Then I would have had Ike

1010
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,064
Continue to have a career in television and film production

1011
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
And there's a

1012
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,000
There's a a very deep respect

1013
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,840
That one ends up having four

1014
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,936
Where they are where they come from and what they have

1015
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
When you go through something like that

1016
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,872
Emma and I just I just have a very very profound respect

1017
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
For what I've done

1018
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,200
And I won't be that person who

1019
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
Runs off and buys plane

1020
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:45,600
Cars and things like that because I have too much respect for how hard it was

1021
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
Together

1022
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,232
There

1023
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,560
Lisa Price founder of Carol's Daughter

1024
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Even though L'Oreal pot

1025
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
The company Lisa is still the public face

1026
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Carol's Daughter

1027
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
And despite becoming financially

1028
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
Secure for life

1029
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Lisa still lives in that

1030
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Same house

1031
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
In Brooklyn

1032
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
She and her husband bought

1033
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,968

1047
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

1048
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
Time now for how you built that and today we're not be the story we ran just over a year ago from Hayden emmolo

1049
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,024
She lives in Jackson Wyoming with her husband Jesse and

1050
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
They're two dots

1051
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
The Husky is yazz named after the baseball player and the German Shepherd is Tuckerman

1052
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
And all four of them spend a lot of time outside its Jackson Wyoming so skiing fly fishing

1053
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
Trail running hiking

1054
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
The dogs love it the humans love it

1055
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
Except for a small problem Tuckerman I noticed a cloudiness in it

1056
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
Signs when he was pretty young like only two years old

1057
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
And then we noticed Yeah Yeah Yeahs

1058
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:33,120
Was getting pretty visible sunburn after we spend long days on the water

1059
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
The sun is really bright

1060
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
And that's what happens a lot of dogs

1061
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Carsense

1062
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
Today after overexposure their eyes swell up

1063
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Dark Cloud over

1064
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,152
And some dogs can even lose their vision

1065
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
Soap to find a solution

1066
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Eden's husband Jesse started

1067
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Digging through their old ski equipment

1068
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
So he just started

1069
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
Chopping up goggles and came up with these

1070
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,232
Retrofitted goggles for the dogs which

1071
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,536
Please thank you

1072
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
Plastic visor that got from

1073
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
The Dollar Store take

1074
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
3 olds

1075
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,472
Ski goggles I'll put together with a jumble of straps and hair ties

1076
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,360
I think I probably laughed out loud when we first put them on it's like this is this is ridiculous but

1077
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
I guess you know I'd better a silly looking dogs in a blind dog

1078
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Waylon Jessi

1079
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
She kept refining

1080
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Until

1081
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
People started to ask

1082
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Hey where can I get those for my dog

1083
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:29,184
But they weren't sure there was an actual market for dog goggles

1084
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
So

1085
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
They decided to ask an expert

1086
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Their vet

1087
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
So he put the Prototype down and looked across

1088
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Table Odyssey said well

1089
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
You're probably going to need some capital

1090
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
And I looked inside

1091
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah yeah I think we will

1092
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
And he's like well

1093
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
I think that's our next conversation

1094
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,384
2 Gap their vet actually gave them some money

1095
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,736
Enough money for Aiden and Jessie to find a manufacturer in China

1096
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
And then launched their very first line

1097
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,600
The lenses range from neon pink

1098
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
2

1099
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
Neon green a lot of people love the the crazy lenses just because they make your dog look like some sort of

1100
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
Superhero robot

1101
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
They make him look pretty badass

1102
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,216
Let me talk to Aiden at year ago they had sold $10,000 since them

1103
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,056
They've nearly doubled that they've also released for new models

1104
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,128
Goggles so they can fit a wide range of dog sizes

1105
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
And

1106
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,992
She and her husband have quit their day jobs to work full-time on the company

1107
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,064
Empty love to tell people that yeah

1108
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,856
Funny I was just that recently died

1109
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,976
College reunions and you know everyone's going around. I haven't seen you Drake new what do you do what are you doing

And people say what

Really I make dog god

1113
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,984
That's Aiden emmolo of Jackson Wyoming xi'an Jesse call their company
