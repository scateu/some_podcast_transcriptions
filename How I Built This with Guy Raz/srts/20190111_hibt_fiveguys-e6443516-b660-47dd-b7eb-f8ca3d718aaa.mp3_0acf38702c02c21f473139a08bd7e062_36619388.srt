00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
He thought

00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520

Jerry Murrell is 73 years old

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
And a long journey to get to where he is today

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
He was born in a small mining town in northern Michigan

56
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
His dad wasn't around that

57
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Cheapest a

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,672
An adventure he wasn't very family-oriented

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
He was a stunt pilot that's probably why my mama have got a divorce family really

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
Catholic school kid

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
Where was

62
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,872
To say are you going to end up selling hamburger something so

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:02,528
Didn't work heart did get through school and eventually

64
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
University of Michigan

65
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,672
I got scared there I said my God how my going to make it in this world with all the smart people around

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,792
I think that was more intimidated after I got out of college then than ever

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
So after college Cherry moved back to his hometown and he married his high school girlfriend

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
I got a job selling life insurance and they had three sons but the marriage didn't last

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,944
Ended up leaving and taking the kids to Florida and for Jerry

70
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
That was a low Point kind of floated around for awhile lived in different cities it wasn't sure what

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Used to do with his life

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,256
But he was sure of one thing

73
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,352
You wanted your kids to live with you how are you do that

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Why didn't know yet

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,824
Around the mid-1970s Jerry was offered at consulting job in the DC area so

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
He took it

77
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
And he moved to Alexandria Virginia

78
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
And that's where you met his second wife

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Cheney

80
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
An effort situation stabilized

81
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
His kids did actually come to live with him

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
And it was also around that time when Jerry decided to

83
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Become a financial planner

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
I was

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Shocked at how much money that was in the

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
DC area size I'm going to go back there

87
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
Financial planning business

88
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
And I got my degree from Mom

89
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Bryn Mawr

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
And I started

91
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Town Financial products

92
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
The people in the DC area

93
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
And then

94
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
That's what I did

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
To the boys move in with you

96
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
All of a sudden you got five people per household of 5 people

97
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
And that was basically what you did you Weaver financial planner

98
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,951
As a financial planner I tried a few businesses I started Oil Business

99
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Some texts

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
I did a couple of dumb things

101
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
I tried to start a water bill

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,167
List of all things I thought were selling bottled water back on within a good idea

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
And everybody laughed at

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
An hour timer

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Is in the early 80s

106
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Clayton Middle 70s

107
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
The worst one was loyal because I started a company then went down to text

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Found out that

109
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,039
They were waiting for me because I was from the East and they're going to take all my money

110
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,647
Heading with my my my wife and I went into the real estate business and leave

111
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
We were experts at

112
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Buying real high

113
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
And then went to a crashing

114
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Got to get rid of it

115
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Okay so if I get this right

116
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
And you were doing financial planning

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Is your mean

118
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Job

119
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
You had like all these business ideas that you would try it on the side

120
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
And basically never no more

121
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Cracked

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
I really didn't know what I

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm just lucky I'm just lucky that

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
But I got the hamburger

125
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
What's a Genesis

126
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,631
You want to hear the short side of the Long Island where I grew up

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Name push em up Tony

128
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Push em up Tony

129
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Had a little tiny hamburger place

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
With a picnic table in it

131
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
And he had a grill

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
And you didn't sell anything except hamburgers

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
Wishing happy

134
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Anna

135
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
Cuz people used to come from all over town to get hamburger

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
And then when I move to Washington

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
Yes couldn't Ocean City Maryland

138
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
Where to place the numbers on Boardwalk fries there's a place are called Thrashers

139
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
20 places on Boardwalk fries

140
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,199
But only one place had a long line and a fracture

141
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,903
So me and the kids got indoor mine like hamburgers fries

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Cheapest simple might work

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
And that's where the idea came from

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
So what did you do did you

145
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
I mean did you go to your wife and say let's try burger joint

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Yes what you say

147
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
Docker same thing the banks

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
Set at the time you guys on your mind

149
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
But we are

150
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
We did a little different

151
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
We said let's not put a lot of money into

152
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Unless

153
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Final

154
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Place where the rent is real low

155
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Out of the way

156
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Where nobody can see it

157
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Play so why would you want to do it that way

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
And we said well

159
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
If we can put it where

160
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
It's hard to find

161
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
But if we can get people coming there

162
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Then we know we got something

163
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
And this was in in 1986

164
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Yes

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
Where was the first location

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Columbia Pike and Glebe Road

167
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
In Arlington Virginia

168
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
And it was like a little place in

169
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
Rent was cheap invoice

170
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
To put up to our first only put $35,000

171
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
And what did that cover

172
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Everything

173
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
The

174
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
The ranch

175
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Equipment equipment

176
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,511
We found junk equipment rebuilt it ourselves

177
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
It was

178
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Stand up only

179
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
And

180
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Chad

181
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Matt were still in high school

182
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,519
Jack chambless I think I'll be 13 or something

183
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Anna

184
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
I said I got some money saved up

185
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Recology

186
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
You want to go to college

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
And now

188
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
They pretty much said

189
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
God would rather do something else

190
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Wake up go back for a second

191
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
You set your kids down

192
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,695
And if you had your kids college fund and you said to them

193
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
Hey look I got this college money I will send you to college

194
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Or

195
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
You cannot go to college we can use it to open up a burger

196
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Right

197
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Were you a mean

198
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
You can imagine today like a parent

199
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Saying that to their kids and then other parent saying

200
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
Your mortgage in your kids

201
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,455
Future on this burger joint yes did you have any of that feeling in your mind like maybe this is not a great

202
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
Know something was telling us it was right thing to do

203
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:00,671
Probably look back on it was probably assumed it was Cowboys kind of crazy here was crazy

204
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
It didn't seem crazy.

205
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
For some reason we all seem to be on board with

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
I was really surprised cuz

207
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
The kids Jump Right In in

208
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Work tired

209
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
January tired

210
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
She kept all the books

211
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
I was amazed how the HobbyKids jumped into it

212
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,687
And what is the story with the name how did Teddy to come up the Walmart one of my lawyer said you should incorporate

213
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
You need to have a name

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
But as he fills out the papers

215
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
This was so well thought out that we didn't happen

216
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
So

217
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Me and Janie and

218
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Boise

219
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
We had that

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Three Sons

221
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Plus one more summer

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Janie

223
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
My stepson wasn't born yet

224
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
So is

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,239
Four Sons with me so we can walk will call Five Guys for now and then we'll change it

226
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
So they get the papers fill out

227
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Will changing the lawyer said okay

228
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,503
Okay sign on your first day of the opening day 1986 did you two discuss have a grand opening

229
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783

Emma first open.

231
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
11

232
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
There's no business at all on their quarter 12

233
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,767
And then one person finally walked in and

234
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
12:30 wheeler

235
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,911
We were almost packed we made money for my very first day

236
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
And

237
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
We were breaking even and we're paying our rent

238
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,383
I need an employee's right cuz everybody was a couple employees but mostly was a kid

239
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
And we were

240
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,551
Paying them some time 7:15 hour or something like that how did you even know how to make

241
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
A burger

I mean where you a good home chef with anybody in your family a good chef

Listen to come from my hometown can't make a burger you can't live so I'm in that we know how to make burgers

244
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,911
And I'm from where I'm from is posing was right in their eyes and they raised potatoes

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,007
I grew up in a finally raised line potato I know I know how to cook a potato

246
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
And I know we know how to cook a hamburger that was both yet

247
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Univera grill-a-burger Out of fried potatoes and that's all you really needed to know

248
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,063
Where did biscuits ingredients from

249
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
The potatoes in it

250
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
How did you know

251
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
How to Source this

252
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
We went to

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Thrashers

254
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
In Ocean City

255
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
And looked on the potato bags

256
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
And we found out they came from Rigby Idaho

257
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
A guy named Rick miles

258
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Small potato dealer out there so we got ahold of him

259
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
I wish I could you show us

260
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Potatoes

261
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
We did not know what the time that he was small

262
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
Now he's become a multi-millionaire

263
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
We buy are potatoes from him

264
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
What was so special about his

265
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Potatoes

266
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,415
They were sold by Thrashers in Ocean City

267
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
So you said

268
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
If there's a line outside this potato joint the potatoes must

269
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Is Miami good recipe good

270
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
What was five guys offer

271
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Was it burgers with all the toppings and all that stuff

272
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
What we did with a kids

273
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Jamie and I would not

274
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Tell the kids how much we were paying

275
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
For the product

276
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
WeChat

277
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Whatever pickles you want to put on there

278
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Hamburgers

279
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
You guys pick the pick

280
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,855
So they were trying different brands and different pickles

281
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
Finally they turned up with the most expensive pickles are where

282
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
And we wouldn't say anything about it would say okay that's a pick what you want by those pickles

283
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
Then we will buy the most expensive cooking oil you want to cook in and

284
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
That's where they cook them on Ocean City

285
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
They wanted to buy this bread from a little baker

286
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Arlington that made really good bread

287
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Brenner's Bakery

288
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Best bakery in Arlington

289
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
But for my restaurant

290
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Expensive we're paying about 7 times

291
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Trump

292
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Hamburger buns McDonald's

293
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
And what was the burger going for in 1986

294
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,143
I think we're selling something like three times four times at McDonald's with sound for which everybody said we are crazy would make it that way but

295
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
We didn't let the kids know

296
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
How much we're paying for any of the food

297
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
So they would just go out there and

298
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Whatever it was

299
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
If they like it that's the way it was

300
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
And what was the thinking behind that

301
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Strategy

302
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
The thinking was that

303
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
They're going to pick the best product

304
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,831
They got to take with a customer likes what they like

305
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
Get Give an example how ridiculous it is

306
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,743
Kids like to certain kind of mayonnaise cuz it was sick

307
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Ana Patricia

308
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
4 things together and that we were buying our mayonnaise at the time from a guy up in the

309
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
New York City that was really hard to get along with and so when we hired our first purchasing agent

310
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,943
He said there's no way that mange is this important no way

311
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Because this guy was so hard to deal with so we had all the family come in and do a blind mayonnaise cake

312
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,975
And to this day I can't eat mayonnaise by itself so we had like nine different

313
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
Dishes with mayonnaise and tactical spoon and everybody would

314
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
Taste of mayonnaise blindfolded and he shall I prove to you that you can't tell the difference in this mayonnaise or any of

315
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,639
And after the Ashley took a bath salts off my wife myself and all the boys pick the same initials

316
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
Equal Employment and I was a man in New York

317
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
So why

318
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
King and I what we would do it at the end of the month we look at them

319
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Versailles

320
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
And then we look at

321
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
How much will pay for

322
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Food and we say we got to raise our prices

323
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
The kids didn't know why we raise the prices

324
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
But we would always say

325
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
Food cost to stay around 30% whatever we got to do

326
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
We got a raise prices

327
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Erase price

328
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
And we have

329
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
If we have to worry about price

330
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
We don't want to be in this position

331
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
Okay so you've got this first Burger Joint right

332
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
And how did people find out about it

333
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
How do people even know about

334
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
The only way would be

335
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Somebody else down

336
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
They said there's this great

337
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Burger places little like

338
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Walk up Shaggy to try it

339
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Sprite

340
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
That's the only way they would have found out about

341
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,167
There was a place in DC when I first moved here at office.

342
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,983
Impoundment lunch and breakfast photos downstairs

343
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
It was an ally

344
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
And it was nothing on the door if I remember right just a steel door coming off the alley

345
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
But that

346
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
All offices around there

347
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Go to this place

348
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
And there was I marked and it was an ally

349
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Anna

350
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:25,183
I was always impressed with the fact that that guy could do that much business out there and I knew him I know much money was Meghan

351
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Nice old it

352
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
And within three months it was gone

353
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
The people were going there for the food

354
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
And it was working

355
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
And I sure want her to think I can do that then

356
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
Will just open up at the corner and people like herself, that they don't like us they want and then we won't be in the business

357
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,015
Coming up how Five Guys did stay in business

358
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
And how they grew Way Beyond Virginia

359
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
Even though it's the last person who wanted to do that

360
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

376
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
I'm guy Raz

377
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
Chokecherry the sun's open

378
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Tiny burger joint in Arlington Virginia

379
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
And it first

380
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
People knew about it through word-of-mouth

381
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Record

382
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Eventually

383
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Newspaper started to write about the burgers

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
And then the lines started to get longer

385
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,975
So Jerry and his family started to think about opening a second location

386
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
But

387
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
They needed the money to finance it

388
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
I remember going in the bank

389
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,471
You going to do what

390
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
That was just a laugh. Us

391
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
But that somebody Sons

392
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
Said we got friends

393
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,991
That their parents got a little bit of money and they know Five Guys is doing good

394
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Maybe we'll ask them for

395
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
For a few thousand

396
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
So we got

397
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
That should we had about a hundred fifty two hundred people

398
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
That would be blowing anyone time to give us money

399
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
But not as investor

400
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Just for loans

401
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
We did it a different way we did it as investors would say

402
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
Give us $5,000

403
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Will give you

404
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Certain percentage of the

405
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Gross not never that

406
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Prophet

407
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Cuz it was always too many ways to get

408
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Cheap people that way

409
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
So I said

410
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
We'll give you a certain percentage of the gross

411
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
Will give you the money every single month

412
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
And

413
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
Anytime you want your money back you can have an abortion while that's

414
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Stupid because you have a blimp

415
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
I was going to come and ask for the money back

416
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
But my method to my madness was also that

417
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
I said to them anytime I want to pay you back I can

418
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
But I knew someday

419
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
If this thing was successful

420
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
Are you going to get better financing

421
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
I can go back to these people and paying back anytime I want

422
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
So you never gave them

423
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Said they weren't Equity owner

424
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Not in the real sense

425
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
We just made a note said

426
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
If the store does

427
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
20000 week you get

428
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Certain percentage at every week

429
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
And we gave him the money

430
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Exactly on time every month

431
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
We could always go back and ask for more money so how much money did you

432
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Did you raise for to do store number 2

433
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Waffle House store number to we probably only had to raise Maybe

434
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
150000

435
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,519
But we had we had a lot of people that just want to throw money at I say like the burgers

436
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,103
They like the fact that we are making money and what they were getting paid every month

437
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
I had about

438
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
75 people I didn't even know on that list

439
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
And I used to say to everyone

440
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
Don't put your money in somebody else's business

441
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
It seems like a lot of people saw something in Five Guys

442
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
Were you

443
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,047
Fully committed to this or did you or you don't feel doing financial planning program Financial

444
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
What at what point

445
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Do you say

446
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,191
To your kids your wife you know I'm going to give up

447
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
My job

448
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
And I'm going to focus on Five Guys full time

449
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
Well that was almost the day I got hit in the head with a broom

450
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,735
I must have been having a bad day at the office or something and I went home that I said my wife I quit

451
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,855
You got to be crazy I said Mom I'm done I'm not going to work anymore

452
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
I'm just going to

453
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
Concentrate on the burger business

454
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
She was

455
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Pretty upset

456
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Because she thought this is too risky yes

457
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
And that you thought

458
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
I think we can make this

459
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
I will I just I thought it was fun

460
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
Yeah I was told my kids I said

461
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
You don't have to be in this bed

462
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
If you want to be

463
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
Make sure it's fun pick something you like to do in the business

464
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,039
Okay so now it was like the entire family focusing full-time on Five Guys

465
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
What would like roles did everybody play

466
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Well

467
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,047
Jamie is like a a general and she is very organized runs office and everything but

468
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
My kids were able to go to investors and so I I kind of if it wasn't for

469
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
For them and my wife there be no Five Guys I didn't Bill Five Guys

470
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Isis

471
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,479
Set around thinking that this thing is growing so fast I can't believe that you know they came up

472
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
But most of the new ideas

473
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
They pretend they listen to me soup I've lived in in the Washington DC area for long time off and on

474
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
Remember you know driving to Virginia

475
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,631
In like you know 1999-2000 to get Five Guys burger in Virginia

476
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
But when it was still just what four or five locations

477
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
2002

478
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
Up until 2002 you grew up to five

479
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,687
Shops and were you doing pretty well with you all making a decent living at that point

480
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
You guys must've been rich

481
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,599
No but the thing is we had figured out the nuts and bolts of the business by then

482
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
Most franchisors

483
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Start off

484
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Franchise

485
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,072
We didn't start off the franchise we had no idea we're going to do that we started off the build family business

486
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
And we put 17 years into it

487
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
We figured out

488
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
How to do it right

489
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
Yeah so what I came time to franchise

490
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
We had a

491
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Perfect system

492
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
How did you done at that point say

493
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
You hate books franchise

494
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Build this thing out

495
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Sons came to me about

496
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
The 19th

497
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
Late night late 1990 inside

498
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Trying to convince me that franchise

499
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
And I was dead set against

500
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Really.

501
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,328
Because I didn't think there was any way I could convince other people

502
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
To do what we were doing

503
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
So how did they change your mind

504
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Well

505
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
There was a guy

506
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Name Mark Moseley

507
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
It was selling franchises

508
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
For another company

509
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
She been watching Five Guys for a while

510
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
And

511
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
My kids

512
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Got me

513
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,064
To meet with him I didn't want to do it

514
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
They bought me a book called

515
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Franchising

516
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
Dummies it was written by

517
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Dave Thomas

518
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Show the guy from Wendy's

519
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Yes okay

520
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Amazon I rather than that and I

521
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
The legal stuff

522
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
I was amazing all the rules you have to follow on everything

523
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,568
So where they talked me into it

524
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
Because of her when you start franchising

525
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,760
First of all, the franchise either you're not going to worry about food cause I pretty

526
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Sounds pretty stupid

527
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,904
You Got Talent franchise either you're not going to advertise that sounds pretty stupid

528
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
You going to tell him that you're only going to sell hamburgers and french fries

529
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
We're all going to be open later we got to sell alcohol we got to watch Food cars Suite

530
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,728
Shop around for rrproducts

531
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
I said I don't do that

532
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
99.5

533
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
We buy from people and we're going to stick with him

534
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
That was all hard to sell the franchise

535
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
But we we got through that

536
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
And I remember Mark coming in

537
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Cuz he was going to be our salesman

538
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
He said he's going to sound like I can't remember how many stores are first year they're going to sell but I said

539
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,656
50 just cut down to 25 you don't have to sell 50

540
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,032
And I think within a year-and-a-half two years we sold 3500

541
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,432
We saw the whole United States

542
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Your burgers were still a lot more expensive than absolutely

543
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
Girl

544
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Man takes longer to get a burger so

545
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,536
I need the business model is different so were you worried, did you ever think

546
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,632
Gill maybe this works in Northern Virginia but I'm not sure this is going to work

547
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Somewhere else

548
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Absolutely scared the heck out of us

549
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
You were talking about the long wait

550
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
I used to have a sign that one of our stores

551
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
That said if you're in a hurry

552
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
There are a lot of really good burger places

553
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Near here

554
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624

555
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,232

558
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
Nobody's you know who we are

559
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
I couldn't sleep the night before

560
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,496
Richmond that's like down the road 90 miles it's nothing

561
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
But I couldn't even sleep last night

562
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616
Nobody's going to know who we are Richmond Stover successful

563
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
And then I said well

564
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Now we're going to go to

565
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
North Kim

566
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
And I said no way we're going to Florida cuz people will

567
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904

571
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Florida Sun

572
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
The idea of going from

573
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632
Five stores in 2002

574
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912

575
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Thousands of stars

576
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Within

577
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,824
A year or two years we didn't go to thousands of storage we sold

578
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Franchise

579
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Those are still being built out

580
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
In the United States

581
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
We got about 1400

582
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248

584
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
It's gone was that just

585
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Mind-boggling

586
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Mine bazzi

587
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
Anna and I was I was so proud of my kids that didn't go to their head

588
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
They're still my kids

589
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
They work just like they used to they work hard on everyday

590
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
What does it mean

591
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
What's it like to work with you or

592
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
Five sons and in your wife I mean

593

They're all involved in coming to work with 8D to do a different thing for the company

594
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
Well I have one son that

Make sure they're painted ride

598
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Decorated rice

599
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
He's really into that

600
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
So that's his job at 1:40.

601
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
Fanatic about the food

602
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:17,216
So he goes around the world putting on shows and how to cook things right stuff

603
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,824
I got another assignment that that he's really into the financial part of it

604
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
Grabbed it and I'm glad

605
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Because I don't understand a lot of

606
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Expressions International

Amazon item find what they want to find and there's a gap that can't be

613
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
Nobody will hire somebody

614
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104

We took in a fairly big investor when I first start franchise

619
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,672
They don't interfere in our business at all they gave us

620
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Big chunk of money

621
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280

In the Middle East

643
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
So I

644
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,456
I think a lot of people when they get a little bit successful

645
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
They look back and try to figure out how they did it

646
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
I can't figure it out

647
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
You still got enough.

648
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,208
Do you think a lot of it was luck

649
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
Who sings I give a lot of credit to my balance great believer in

650
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,656
Intuition or a higher power

651
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
God whatever you want to call it

652
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,776
Great believer in not

653
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Listening to my hunches

654
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,224
I could have my own that's for sure

655
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
I kiss my wife cuz

656
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,088
Seems like to me without them nothing

657
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
We were lucky real lucky

658
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
Real real lucky

659
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you

660
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
Your vision was not to

661
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Open up a burger joint your vision was to get

662
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Your kids to live with you

663
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
When you and your wife divorced

664
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,312
Which that was your I guess that was your real success

665
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
Getting your kids

666
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
The best things I ever have in my life is my

667
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
Captures no.

668
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
And the best thing that's happened to their mother

669
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Which is my ex-wife

670
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
It's the fact that

671
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
The Rambler

672
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Do all kinds of wonder

673
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Yeah

674
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
And you still have a

675
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Pretty good relationship with her

676
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
My current wife

677
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
Hatuey William

We got a lot we don't know if she's benefited from your

679
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
The success of your sons

680
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
How did being

681
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Financially stable

682
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
End

683
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Set out of that change your life were you able to do things that you

684
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
You couldn't do before

685
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Well

686
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
Most people that I know

687
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
I've known

688
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Since I've been a kid

689
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,488
When I started Five Guys I let three or four my buddies that I went to HighSchool with

690
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Buy stock in my company

691
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,840
Cuz I thought it would be a great thing for them

692
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Canadian ham

693
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Little bit better

694
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
And one of my had a loan on them

695
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
And they're all millionaires

696
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
But we're still

697
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
Same old people I mean I just had

698
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Bunch of money

699
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:13,248
Friends down from my Michigan a couple weeks ago on my boat

700
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Florida

701
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
We drink beer together

702
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
Same as it was

703
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
34 years ago

704
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:26,048
You can lead a pretty Anonymous life like no one you're not walking on the street no one's like there's Jerry the founder Five Guys

705
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
Know that my wife always says

706
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
She gets upset of me

707
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Sitting on the front yard

708
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
Mercante beans

709
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,056
I always wear Levi's

710
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
But that

711
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
I don't

712
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
I don't know other people look at me but

713
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
I don't I don't think anybody put on airs out

714
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
Yes it's amazing you said earlier that

715
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,464
That when he was a kid that the nuns said you were going to sell hamburgers

716
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
What about

717
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Your mom

718
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
What would she thought about

719
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
What you did with Five Guys hamburgers

720
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
My mom like a bird

721
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,520
Shoe cobbler with nothing with a good idea that my mom used to say

722
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
If you can make a good hamburger

723
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Or serve good drink

724
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
Or give a good haircut you'll always

725
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Have something to do with you

726
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Have an income

727
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Jerry Murrell

728
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
Founder of Five Guys Burgers and Fries

729
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,720
All of the restaurants in franchises around the world

730
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,816
He says they are approaching 2 billion dollars in Revenue

731
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Oh wait four years

732
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:38,752
Five Guys resisted selling milkshakes years ago after considerable debate

733
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Some stores decided to start selling them with Nixon flavors like peanut butter banana

734
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
Strawberry salted caramel and of course

735
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272

740
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,816
One of our sponsors National Geographic Valley of the Boom

741
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
It's about the first.

742
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
The internet

743
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888

745
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
National Geographic

00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
Watch the first two episodes

747
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
On demand and on the mat

748
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Gotv app

749
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it

750
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
How you built that

751
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
And today we're updating story we first ran

752
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,672
About a year ago warning if you're a parent of small children

753
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,792
You are about to hear about poop and barf because those two things

754
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Are at the very heart of Hannah England's business

755
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:42,752
She has two small children of her own and if you ever wondered what happens inside one of those

756
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
Family changing rooms

757
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Well

758
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
I walked into the bathroom

759
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
And

760
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:54,272
There were two moms one was at the changing station and her baby had just how

761
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,320
Had a blowout like

762
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,904
Major like up the back all the way to the neck

763
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,280
And this is going to be a situation that every mom

764
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,120
Get themselves into

765
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
I've been there and see nothing

766
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
Once you've cleaned up your kid

767
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:19,616
What do you supposed to do with all those soiled and disgusting clothes especially when you're not at home

768
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,432
Just cringe when you have to stick that in your diaper bag

769
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:27,552
And then when you have to open it after a full day I mean it is not pleasant

770
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,672
After the clothes have festered in your diaper bag for a day

771
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,256
It may become impossible to get the stains out of

772
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,816
All the Scott Hannah thinking

773
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,936
I came up with this idea when I was putting my three-year-old

774
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
Too bad and it came out to the living room

775
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,056
Just started describing to my

776
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Sister-in-law and my husband

777
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,712
This bag that's soaking bag and I and I kept filling in the blanks what if we could

778
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
And what if it had this

779
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
And then they looked at me and they're like

780
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:04,160
Well it sounds like you just invented it and what Hannah and vision was a water type

781
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Plastic bag

782
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
That you could keep in your diaper bag

783
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
It would have a soap pod in it

784
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,584
Kind of like the pot that goes into your dishwasher

785
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,912
So that when your kitten pooped or barfed all over her clothes

786
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
You just throw it in the bag

787
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,264
Add water and well above clothes

788
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,104
Soak in soapy water while you went about your day

789
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,944
And then I kind of just hit the ground running because

790
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,016
I thought I need this in my life

791
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
Show about 2 years ago

792
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
Hannah started calling manufacturers

793
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
Basscenter prototypes of

794
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,512
The plastic bags and she and her husband began to Testa immediately

795
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
Fill it with water and steal it and hang it upside down in our living room and kitchen soap

796
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,728
To look for drips and leaks because

797
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
We want these things to be able to hold up in a mom's diaper bag and that's like going to combat

798
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Nothing work

799
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,272
The bags of Braker the zippers are come on down and water would get everywhere

800
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Joe Panik

801
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Kept calling around until she found

802
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,952
One manufacturer in Wisconsin who seemed to know exactly

803
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
She need it

804
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
And he goes well I think we're going with this deal that's actually really aggressive for your utility and I said

805
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
Exactly wanted to be aggressive a seals so aggressive

806
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,288
But you would have to use scissors to get it open

807
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,664
And then Hannah felt another manufacturer to make a very gentle soap pod

808
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Finally

809
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
She designed the outside of the bags

810
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,832
Classy black and white stripes and one of the design itself to knots

811
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,160
Scream like okay this is a bag for

812
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
Soiled poo

813
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,072
Kickstarter campaign to raise about $12,000 and for a while

814
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Look like she wasn't going to make her goal

815
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
But then an amazing thing happened the accounting software company QuickBooks found out about her

816
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
QuickBooks has this program where it support small businesses and so someone from QuickBooks enter a mess

817
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,064
Search fire Kickstarter that basically said they were going to back you for the rest of the way it just showed up on our

818
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Kickstarter thing

819
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,744
And my husband of course was going nope this is some weird fraud thing and I laughed at him and I

820
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,096
What kind of fraud puts money into your bank account

821
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Normally they take money out

822
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
Hannah was right

823
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
It was not fraud

824
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
And in December of 2017

825
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
She shipped her very first production run

826
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
About 5000 bag

827
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
To those Kickstarter backers

828
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
A company is called

829
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Wash it

830
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Later

831
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
And since we spoke to Hannah last year

832
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:45,440
The company has moved from her basement to an actual office in about two months ago they started selling

833
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:51,840
The grab-and-go version of their diaper bag it's become an even bigger success than their original product

834
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,936
