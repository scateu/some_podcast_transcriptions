00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
From the live audience

And towns

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
Throughout the year

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:49,152
But right now we've got one of our all-time favorites from the HIV T archive soap

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Enjoy

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
We ended up going from 0 to 800 homes in a matter for week

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
And I have to tell you I thought that this was it like this was

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
Are rocket ship to the Moon. We made it we're here we got it right this is you build it they will come

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Look what's happening and so we get introduced to 20 vest Silicon Valley

20
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
None of them reply to her email five of them for coffee zero invested

21
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
From NPR how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
And the movements they go

23
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
The story of how a side hustle to pay rent

24
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,104
More rooms in the biggest hotel chain in the world

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,832
10 years ago even five years ago most of us would have thought the idea of

26
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,160
Renting out a room in our home to a complete

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Stranger

28
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,560
A little creepy even spending the night in someone else's home you never met would

29
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Probably seen weird

30
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
Especially on vacation or business

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
But now it's not just normal

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,616
It's actually the preferred way to overnight from millions of people around the world celebrities do it

33
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,224
A company that made all of this normal of course is Airbnb

34
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Guys who started it

35
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
Had no background in travel or hot

36
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Natality or even technology

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Joe gebbia graduated

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Art school at the Rhode Island School of Design

39
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Francesca's co-founder was Jose

40
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
College buddy they play pickup basketball together

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,424
And actually graduated in 2005

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Joe and Brian moved out west

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Brian went to LA

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Going to San Francisco

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,152
And in the first year Joe who was designing book covers at a Publishing House

46
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Worked

47
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,016
Really hard to convince Brian to move up to San Francisco to start a business

48
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
Is Joe tells a story after some prodding

49
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
Brian agreed

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,256
Both of us simultaneously quit our jobs he left his I was at Chronicle Books full-time at that point

51
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
And I left

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
2

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,168
To dream of something with him and for you guys were liking your

54
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,776
20s need a whole lot of money presumably

55
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
At this point now

56
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
We're just a couple of college grads you know eating Ramen

57
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Yeah

58
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,504
What is everybody Ramen Everybody Eats Ramen so cheap Ramen Ramen Ramen

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,880
Give rice rice cereal to Mexico

60
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
You're eating Ramen

61
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
And what you're just like spitballing ideas

62
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
We spitballing ideas that first week was so exciting the first week he comes your

63
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,912
You're like my God yes I mean the first week felt like RISD again

64
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Place is full of ideas

65
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
And then

66
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Something ominous

67
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
A letter came in the mail

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
I open it up it's just me

69
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Pulled out and its former landlord

70
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
To politely

71
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
States that are rent

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,368
Is now 25% higher than it was the month before

73
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Weight room 1-month erased by

74
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
25%

75
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
25%

76
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
And that's legal

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
It was not under rent control

78
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Wake me up with Intuit

79
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
And so we would like

80
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Freaking out

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Of course I went randomly

82
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
My online banking and it was like oh my God oh my God can I make rent next month and Bryant the same thing we realize that we we almost

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Couldn't

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
We aren't getting paychecks at this point yeah

85
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
So

86
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
This is a moment where

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Your back's against the wall

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
And I feel like

89
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,879
Call the creative training that we received start to pay off cuz we start to think about okay well how come

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Designer way out of this

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
And that was when I

92
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Reflected on

93
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Previous experience that I had

94
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Back in Providence

95
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
The day before that I laughed I drove cross-country I sold off all my stuff

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
And when I was having that yard sale

97
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
This guy pulls up in a red Mazda Miata

98
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
And start looking my stuff

99
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
And I'm getting pretty annoyed cuz I'm ready to go home

100
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Bonanza buying a piece of art that I was selling so we get to talkin

101
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
And he tells me all about

102
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
How is about to go into the Peace Corps and he's driving cross-country

103
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
She doesn't know a soul in Providence so I invite him out for a drink that night

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
And

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
I make the mistake of asking him

106
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
So are you staying the night

107
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
And he makes it worse by saying

108
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:33,567
Actually I don't have a place man

109
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
What do you do

110
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
A place like we've all been there like to my house this guy

111
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
So before I know what I'm saying I'm like

112
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
How you can stay in an air bed in my living room

113
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Balanitis intimate in the living room

114
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
And I I go to bed I try to fall asleep

115
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
I'm staring at the ceiling thinking

116
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Oh my God

117
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
What have I done

118
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,607
There's a complete stranger in my living room

119
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
What did he say

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
So I get up I tiptoed my door and I go out

121
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
My bedroom door

122
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
The next morning we wake up

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
We get breakfast together turned out he was not psychotic

124
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
10 piece of art that he bought hangs in

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Classroom music teacher now

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
And he still

127
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Saint Joseph

128
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Don't touch

129
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Subjected to this is the dude that

130
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Bible

131
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
How to become a baby so how did you

132
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
So you're in your apartment your rents going up 25%

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
And what do you see

134
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Alexis rent a room or apartment

135
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Well I'm looking at my laptop

136
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
And there's a design conferences coming to San Francisco

137
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
Industrial designers

138
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Conference

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,615
And on the Converse website in Big Red Letters it said hotels

140
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Sold out

141
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
You think I'm mad what a bummer

142
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,831
Designers want to come last minute and I can have a place to stay and in that instant I woke up

143
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
And looking around the living room

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
I got weight

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
With so much extra space here

146
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
And I have earbuds in the closet in the idea of Hosting people in air beds

147
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
I gradually become natural to me

148
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
And

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
The thinking is they'll be more than just

150
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,959
The place to sleep we can cook breakfast in the morning will pick him up from the airport

151
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
I will give him a neighborhood guide and a map to San Francisco

152
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
So did how did you get the word out about it haven't these designers know that

153
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
This is available

154
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
Well we can know we didn't want to use any of the classified websites cuz

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
There's going to be people in her home

156
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
So we made our own

157
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Winning image

158
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
What we did on your website website

159
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
That said what

160
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Well it said

161
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
Who we were it said about that this concept of

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Stay with us mobile provide these things for you

163
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
This website was just for the design car

164
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,007
That's it for one weekend what did you call it when the website

165
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
It was a little recalled

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
Air bed and breakfast.com and we start to get emails

167
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
From around the world

168
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Designers who need a place to stay emails from London from Brazil from Japan

169
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
People actually started sending us their resumes their LinkedIn profiles to 2/4 one of these bees

170
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Limited 3-year beds for $80 a night you could stay in San Francisco with Brian and I

171
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
That's a great deal

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Is it to remember who your first guess where

173
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Yeah so is more Catherine and Michael where the first three guests and

174
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
You know what happened next I don't think we could have predicted

175
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
They stayed with us and we got to show them

176
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
San Francisco they got to

177
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,255
Get the feel like they they belong there in the sense that didn't feel like Outsiders

178
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
You know what I mean like

179
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Yeah

180
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
And you'll never forget

181
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Saying goodbye in and watching the door

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Door Clicker

183
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Close

184
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
And thinking with Brian

185
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
What if we made it possible for other people

186
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Also share their experience in in

187
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
Gaston or home and show off their City

188
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
At what point did you and Brian location

189
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Can I go

190
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Okay man

191
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
I think this is

192
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Start business

193
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Was it like right after that door closed

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
I wish I wish it was but I can say that at

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
What's the case

196
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
Send that December we both went home

197
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
For holiday

198
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
End

199
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
Add a respected New Year's Eve parties everyone asks so what are you doing in San Francisco

200
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
What were entrepreneurs

201
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
What do you want for dinner any

202
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
And we didn't really have very much

203
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Other than to say

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
Well let me tell bout this time where we hosted these three guests on air beds in her apartment

205
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
And one of two things happen

206
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
People do said

207
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
Oh my God that's the coolest thing in the world where can I do that

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Or they said

209
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
That is the most bizarre creepiest thing I've ever heard

210
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
And they left the conversation

211
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
And I think one of the things that I've learned is that great ideas

212
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
I think they usually start out as

213
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Polarizing you're not kind of like it's kind of okay

214
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
They either really talk on somebody's

215
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
Emotions are undulating desire that they have butts never been in

216
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Before

217
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Were they really

218
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Determinants of life

219
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,783
As long as people who really gravitate towards the ATM to me that's a signal fmip on somebody

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
So what

221
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
What you guys do next

222
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
Well we knew that we needed a great technical expertise

223
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
And

224
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Funny thing

225
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
The Roommate

226
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
To move doubts that Brian can move in with a guy named Naples Charizard

227
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Meet with an engineer

228
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Who found me on Craigslist

229
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
And as we live together

230
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
There were some similarities in

231
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
How many deny

232
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Worked

233
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Which is that we come home from our day jobs

234
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
And in the evening we would both

235
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Work maniacally on her own projects

236
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
I looked over my shoulder

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
I remember thinking to myself

238
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
This guy had to work ethic just like I do

239
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
If I ever need an engineer

240
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
I think I'm going to call Nate

241
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
So here we are

242
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
January

243
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
2008

244
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
So I meet Nate for a drink

245
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
Home. This this weekend experiment with these three guests

246
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
And

247
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
I need love the idea

248
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
He's like

249
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
We can use the internet tax you get people off the internet how cool is that

250
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
And he have these like this

251
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Is coding experience

252
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Neither you nor nor brand

253
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Use a computer science degree from Harvard

254
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Yeah he sure did

255
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
So

256
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
I guess at this point you have your team assembled because

257
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Idea

258
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
If your website so when do you

259
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
What do you really decide to Launch

260
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
We all agreed that we would watch the next version of our site

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Urbana Rec

262
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
At the next

263
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Big Tex

264
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Because

265
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,615
Actually we thought the original opportunity was housing for conferences Sprite

266
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
So the next big when I was coming up

267
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
What's South by Southwest

268
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,599
And every year the same thing happens Hotel sell out months in advance people Scramble for housing

269
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,159
And it's also the the the place where

270
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Some of the tag rated lawn

271
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
Forrest Twitter launch their Foursquare and others

272
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
With audible this is perfect

273
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
We're just going to follow the rocket ship that the all that didn't

274
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,263
So at this point we have about three weeks to build before South by Southwest I'm doing design 18 the coding

275
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
We're just pulling on a piece together

276
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
No money at all

277
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Just doing this

278
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
So

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,855
We get it out just in time we ship it when you say your ship

280
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
We release the next version of a site

281
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,791
And we think this is this is the next greatest thing and at this point there's not a single listing on ride

282
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
I got

283
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
We actually had six people

284
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
Put up listings in Austin and we had two people

285
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Book those listings

286
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
One of them

287
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Was Brian

288
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,455
So it was not a smashing success at all this was where you guys at

289
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Sad are you laughing about it or

290
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,135
Now this is completely demoralizing idea that we were so excited about

291
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
And

292
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Nobody

293
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Took us up on the idea

294
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
So we learn two things from Austin

295
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
The first was that

296
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Exchanging money in person

297
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Really awkward

298
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
Especially inside of a home

299
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
So we thought we'll

300
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,431
Why do we pay past exchange cash in person what if we just bring the transaction online

301
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
What if we allowed people

302
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
To see monthly pay with a credit card

303
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Semi you would for traditional combinations on the internet

304
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
But instead you get somebody down

305
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Right

306
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
And suddenly

307
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
We realize we had a business model

308
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
We said well maybe we'll just take a transaction fee

309
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
As we

310
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Flow the funds from guests

311
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
The Host

312
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
The second thing we learned is that there were people who did want to travel

313
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
Where the word conference is taking place

314
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Decoding our first three guests

315
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Cattermole Michael you must hate

316
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
I'm going to Vancouver next week

317
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
How do I stay in somebody's home I had such a good experience

318
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
I'm like woah

319
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Is there a conference going on

320
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
I'm single

321
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Why do we need to be, maybe this is just a trapezoid

322
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
So we went back to me and said

323
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
What's the what's the ad payments and what's make

324
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
It's a travel site

325
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Need start warm up the idea

326
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
But had some real

327
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Questions about

328
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
How to get a market place like that starting

329
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
So he started to build something

330
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Even more ambitious

331
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Well actually he moved back to Boston

332
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
To be with his girlfriend

333
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
It's kind of a dance falling apart a little bit

334
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
And that's only had an idea

335
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Which was

336
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
What if we re-watch the new version of a service

337
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
And we do it

338
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
At the crest

339
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Of a tidal wave

340
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Oppress

341
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
Which in summer 2008

342
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Was Barack Obama

343
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
It specifically

344
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
Obama speaking at the Democratic National Convention

345
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Denver Colorado

346
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,031
Yeah where there was a housing crisis

347
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Because

348
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
A hundred thousand people working

349
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Anticipated to see Obama speech

350
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
And the river

351
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
Less than 30000 hotel room

352
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Most of which were picked up by

353
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
Delegates

354
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,927
So this is a real problem in fact the mayor of Denver at one point thought about opening up the city parks

355
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Touki bouki campout

356
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
What if we time the relaunch of a service

357
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
The third launch

358
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
During the DNC we can ride

359
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
The coattails of all the Obama press to bring what awareness to this Marketplace that's exactly what we did

360
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,943
We hustled Seafood in Denver we met people in the ground we got local press was turned into Regional press was turned an ash

361
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Depressing eventually International press

362
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,599
Wow and so this is still weeks before the convention July 2008

363
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
What happened

364
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Well

365
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
We did a live interview with CNN

366
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Armor living room

367
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
And we have about a hundred people

368
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Actually

369
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
Book and pay with a credit card through a service

370
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Which this was like the first

371
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
Sign of a working viable Marketplace

372
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Even if the point liquor

373
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
We're getting customer service calls

374
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
For the first time

375
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
And that just like was your cell phone

376
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Yeah

377
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
How did it go

378
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
I hate we ended up going from 0 to 800 homes

379
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
What's the matter for weeks

380
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
So 800 homes

381
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
Are on this site called

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
Air bed and breakfast run

383
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
And I have to tell you I thought that this was it like this was

384
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
AR

385
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
Rocketship to the Moon

386
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,823
You thought we made it we're here we got it right if you build it they will come and look what's happening

387
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
And they came yeah

388
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
And then the convention ended

389
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
And all those numbers came crashing right back

390
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
So

391
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Here we headed to London

392
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
Because at this point we'd also started talking to investors

393
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
With all this is a great time talk

394
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
Working with stories

395
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
We get

396
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Introduce 220 vest Silicon Valley

397
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
None of them reply to her email

398
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Five of them use for coffee

399
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
0

400
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Invested

401
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Wow

402
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
It was completely demoralizing

403
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Yeah like 2008 was the worst year of my life

404
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,759
Really oh my gosh yes because you put so much into this thing

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Write like

406
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
I don't have nothing else going on my life

407
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
It's the best

408
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:03,487
And to put it in front of very credible investors the guys that depict the Googles and PayPal and YouTube's of the world

409
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,071
And since the focus Square in the eyes ago it was weird

410
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
I'm not invested in this what did they say what what why

411
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
Well they didn't say this but here's the underlined

412
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
It's because we've all been taught since we were kids

413
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
That strangers evil Danger

414
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,175
No one in their right mind would invest in a service that was

415
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Based upon

416
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
This pitch that

417
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
What we want to build a website where people

418
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
Publicly post images of the most intimate space is there

419
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Bedrooms there bathrooms

420
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
The kinds of rooms that

421
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Usually closed when people come over

422
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
And then

423
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Over the internet

424
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,887
You can invite complete strangers to sleep in their homes it's going to be huge

425
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
So this is like

426
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Conventions you're thinking

427
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,871
We got it we're going to get all this make all this money and I'll raise all this money and and all the sudden you get back to San Francisco and nobody wants

428
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
To give you any money

429
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Exactly

430
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Nobody

431
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
How are you keeping up the business

432
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Going if you didn't have any

433
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,903
Any cash we did raise around financing we call it the Visa round

434
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
Which mission to you you max out your credit cards

435
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
You know those binders reheat baseball cards

436
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,887
Yeah I had one of those except they weren't baseball cards and credit cards

437
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
We would go through Visa

438
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
After Visa

439
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
Two MasterCards on final to Amex

440
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Just maxing out

441
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Credit cards

442
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
And that's how we funded herself

443
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,503
I can tell you like this not no worse feeling to get a credit card statement that's only going up

444
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,343
With no hope of ever painted town named for this by the way

445
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
In the startup world

446
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,463
There's a name for this phase of a company where you have a product in the market but they don't

447
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
It yet

448
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,119
It's almost like two gears that don't touch this is mysterious gap between these metal gears

449
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
That you can't figure out how to close the gap

450
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,335
And because the trough of Sorrow it's a long

451
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
. of time where you don't have product-market fit in in the day they are the analytics it looks like the Midwest

452
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
Steve analytics because it's perfectly flat

453
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
There's zero growth this is when people tend to quit

454
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:16,095
A moment only comeback have a Joe gebbia and

455
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
Partners eventually find their way out of that trough of Sorrow I'm gyros near listening to how I built this

456
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,591
Yep

Capital One na

477
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
It's how I built this from NPR

478
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Gyros

479
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,327
Its 2008

480
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
Jonas Partners have no investors

481
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
And a lot of credit card debt

482
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
And I'm trying to figure out

483
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Are raised

484
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
It was at this point that Brian and I are in the kitchen late one night like 2 in the morning

485
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
And we're just trying to keep each other's spirits up

486
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
And

487
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
During the peak of Obama vs McCain

488
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
It's like September

489
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:18,976
And we're working on this idea of being are bed and breakfast in providing maybe would give her host to breakfast cereal to give their guests

490
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Would it be funny if it was politically themed

491
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Oh yeah we call it like a

492
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Obama O's the breakfast of change

493
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
Or maybe cat McCain's a Maverick and everybody

494
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
And we actually end up making breakfast cereal

495
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Wait

496
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
You made breakfast cereal

497
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
Like actual cereal to eat

498
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
That's a good question

499
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
Which is how do you make breakfast cereal and how do you do it with not zero budget but a negative urine a deficit by the way

500
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,280
So you know I picked up the phone I called Kellogg General Mills

501
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
And

502
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
Check on to the pitch tonight I got hello

503
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Hello

504
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
It hung up on me

505
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
And then it dawned on me well maybe we don't have to make cereal

506
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Maybe we can just

507
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Go to the grocery store

508
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Buy some cereal off the shelf

509
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Designer unboxing

510
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,248
Put the bag of cereal in her inbox see what happened and sell it that way

511
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
Just sell it on the street well maybe make website

512
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
We know how to do that

513
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:22,976
Instead of Airbnb or in addition to assure

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Then the question was

515
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
How do you make the boxes

516
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
So I found an illustrator

517
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Did Art Direction put all the pieces together

518
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
I found a RISD alumni

519
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
In the East Bay here in Sanford

520
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
The guy that

521
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Winning

522
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
And

523
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
You know I like Ike

524
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
I poured it all out to this guy sitting

525
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,456
Here's the idea of the concept really excited. Here's the mock-ups and sketches

526
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
Because all right here's what I'll do

527
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
I'll make 500 of each box

528
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,904
He doesn't have to pay me up front but pay me commission-based underwear sale

529
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
And it dawned on us that

530
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
With 500 of each box will that was a limited edition

531
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
That was a collector's item

532
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
We could number them

533
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
On the top of the box at 500

534
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
And suddenly

535
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,264
We decided we could sell a box of Obama O's and cap McCain

536
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
$40

537
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
The Box

538
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,272
She's just a crazy story I don't even I don't even have forgotten about Airbnb where where we going

539
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
What's going on with his interview

540
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
Look it's a it's an entrepreneur Bender

541
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
So

542
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
We make Obama's. Com

543
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,096
We get the boxes so we put a hundred boxes together

544
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
We mailed them out to all the press that we

545
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
The Weeknd

546
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
Mailto like

547
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
Every morning show had a box of these

548
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
So we didn't get featured on all of these different shows CNN did a live interview with us about breakfast cereal

549
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
And we were the number-one politically themed video

550
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
Altenen.com for the entire day

551
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
And after that CNN interview

552
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
We ended up selling out of Obama bows

553
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Which is incredible like where did you think you were going to go from there like well it's almost didn't matter because

554
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,584
$40 box * 500 boxes

555
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Yes $20,000 in breakfast cereal

556
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
Yeah which was breakfast cereal. We just enough to pay off her credit cards

557
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
All right so you pay off your credit card bills

558
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,360
And then what you go back to are Ben Rector

559
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Well we got to this this through fateful dinner one night

560
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
With one of our mentors

561
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
It was Michael Seibel and Justin Kahn

562
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,624
And so I brought the dinner with them and

563
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,696
They've been helping us the last couple months and what kind of like

564
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
At the end of the rope and they can tell and they're like

565
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
You guys need some help

566
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
You should

567
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Participate

568
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
In this incubator program called y combinator

569
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,728
Red dinner we look upon our phones and the deadline was the night before

570
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
Like come on

571
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
The end up

572
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
Emailing the guy who runs in a guy named Paul Graham

573
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,992
They knew and they say you know a Paul there's these guys if you got this concept and and

574
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
It really benefit from being in your program

575
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Tickle to the application

576
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,952

577
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768

578
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
We start to fill out the application pretty intense yeah

579
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Aspen X2

580
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
We get this callback

581
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Better application got accepted

582
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
We got to the next round which is an interview

583
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Keratin advance

584
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
Do the grill each other with

585
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
All these weights

586
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Cheap and expand internationally

587
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
You know what's the next big future going to build

588
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Excetera excetera

589
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,880
And so we going to the interview it's in the small tiny room

590
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Hawaii, your office

591
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
And as for partners around the table

592
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Sit down

593
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
Very first thing

594
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
A toboggan is mouth is

595
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
You mean people actually use this

596
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Miguel

597
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
Yeah and goes well that's weird

598
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
What is that it's not a good start of any kind

599
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
It kind of went downhill from there

600
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
We're walking out of the room

601
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
Something like this is our last chance effort and it didn't go so well

602
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,600
And that's when I remembered that I had brought a box of Obama's

603
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
To give to him as a gift

604
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
Psycho Ronnie back in the room

605
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,280
I whip out the box by handsome guy Paul we got this for you

606
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Because

607
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Oh where'd you buy this

608
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
I go well we made it

609
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
Because what do you mean you made it

610
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,056
And I told the story in 60 seconds Migos wait so you guys funded your company based on selling breakfast cereal

611
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,640
I immediately turned around and put the box of cereal on the shelf behind the desk

612
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
On the ride home

613
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
We get a phone call

614
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Paul Graham

615
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
To inform us that he'd like to offer us

616
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
A spot

617
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
NY Common Core program

618
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
And

619
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
I'll be waiter found out

620
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,768
That the reason we got it wasn't because of her idea

621
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
It was because

622
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,168
Through the breakfast cereal we can prove to him that we had hustle we had Grit

623
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,520
If we can figure out Hussle breakfast over for $40 a box

624
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,616
We can figure out how to make a website work

625
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Alright so you get into y combinator

626
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
And

627
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
What what is a

628
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Like what does it do for you

629
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
Guys what what happened there

630
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
Y combinator was a game-changer for us

631
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
And I'll never forget the first office hours

632
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
That we had with Paul Graham

633
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
You sit down with us

634
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
And he goes

635
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
Where is your Market

636
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
And

637
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
We all get each other and were like

638
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
We don't really have a market

639
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
No one's really using the website

640
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
But we go you know

641
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,456
New York is showing some promise we have 30 hosts in New York

642
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
You're renting it there extra rooms out in their homes in

643
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Migas

644
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Your customers are in New York City

645
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
But you're here in Mountain View

646
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
And yeah we're here for your program

647
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Everything goes

648
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
What are you still doing here

649
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,656
Go to New York City and he points his finger at you he's got this thing ready to go to even

650
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Finger

651
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
And it was in this moment

652
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
Sitting in this room this tiny room

653
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
We're something profound change for us

654
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
Because up until this point

655
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,480
We had subscribed to the ethology of Silicon Valley

656
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,832
Yeah wishes that you have to solve things in a scalable way

657
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
Because what happens when one day

658
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
The rocket ship takes off

659
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
You already left behind because your code held you back

660
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
And so

661
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
We could try to solve our problems by

662
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
Decoding our way through it

663
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
And if you remember that didn't get us anywhere cuz

664
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
We are in the Midwest

665
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Analytics

666
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
Sprite and so here comes Paul Graham

667
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Gave us permission

668
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
To do things that don't scale

669
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Such as

670
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Fly across the country and meet the early doctors of your service

671
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah and it was in that moment that we felt so much more free

672
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
To think

673
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Even more creatively about how we could get our service off

674
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
The ground if you can do things that don't have

675
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Have to scale

676
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
What else could we do

677
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
And

678
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
As we start going through the search

679
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,632
Results and looking at the house

680
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Identify the pattern

681
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
And the pattern was this

682
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,800
People just generally didn't know how to take a good photo of your home

683
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
So the phone is really bad

684
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,408
Sentence of the photos you had on

685
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Decided that timer

686
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Crappy photos

687
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,808
Well you know people using their camera phones at the time it was like flip

688
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Camera phones which of the

689
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,440
They're taking pictures at night it just wasn't

690
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Different merchandising their home and away.

691
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,560
You would want to stay there so therefore no one was booking them

692
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
And we thought you know

693
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
I went to Art School

694
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Photography classes

695
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
Photography my whole life in fact

696
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
The Hobby

697
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,824
Moon about if we just flew out there for a weekend

698
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
We could probably take some ice for photos

699
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
And we won't charge you for it will do for free

700
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
That weekend we bought plane tickets Brian life live in New York

701
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
We've emailed her hosts all three of them

702
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
We rented a really nice camera

703
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
And went door-to-door throughout Manhattan Brooklyn and then other parts of New York

704
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,560
And it's funny cuz he had knocked on the door and then they open the door and introduce myself

705
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
As a

706
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,144
I'm Jo I emailed you from Airbnb

707
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
And I kind of like looking over my shoulder so yeah where's the professional

708
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
Photography promise I guess that's me too I'm asking to take the photos for you yet

709
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
Say you're the guy taking the photos

710
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,944
So yeah I'm taking photos and in what school is at

711
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
The photos are looking pretty good and getting the lighting right

712
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Composition in I'm kind of

713
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,904
I'm staging to place a little bit of skin fluffing the pillows and then make sure that the place doesn't look cluttered

714
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
And

715
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
I show the photos in the back

716
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
The camera said hey what do you think

717
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Do you like these

718
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
And

719
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
These houses were like

720
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:32,448
Oh my God my apartment looks amazing I can't believe it

721
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Do you want to stay for some tea or coffee

722
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,848
And so I'd end up spending a few hours sometimes in their in their homes

723
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Just talking with them

724
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
And this is where

725
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,760
Instinctively we went into design research mode

726
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Which is

727
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,136
Going out and talking to the people you're designing for

728
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Such that you can understand

729
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
The world from their point of view

730
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
To inform your point of view

731
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah and so I called this

732
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Enlightened empathy

733
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,472
Which is seen the world so closely in the shoes of the person that you're creating for

734
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
That you can see

735
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
The world that way they see it

736
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
You bring those inside back and you combine it with your own

737
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Design point of view

738
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
To create something new

739
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,808
So here we are in the living room they caught the laptop by Sade

740
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,648
Could you show me how how you check your calendar

741
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Show me how you message with guest

742
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
And

743
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
In those moments

744
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,840
We saw how are perfectly designed interface

745
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
Completely and utterly fail

746
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,984
Well with what we thought took two or three clicks to get done

747
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
People were taking

748
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
1012 Quicksilver

749
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
Stumbling around getting the Lost

750
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,176
Within our own website and you guys did not know that up until that point

751
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
We had no idea

752
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,344
And so it wasn't until we actually sat down next to her early adopters some of her most passionate

753
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Early customers

754
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
And they reveal to us

755
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
The mysterious Gap

756
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Betweener products

757
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
And our Market

758
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
Was the inefficiencies

759
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
R user interface

760
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
What's interesting about this is that

761
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
You don't strike me as like an egomaniac or somebody who doesn't like that you sent me somebody really wants it and it's

762
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
Surprising that it took you guys so long to discover this

763
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
I know right

764
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
I know

765
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
But once we did it was

766
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
It was like

767
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Is like a jackpot yeah

768
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
So we came back with Oliver our discoveries

769
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Something interesting

770
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
Are numbers

771
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
That second week

772
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Went from

773
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
$200 a week

774
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
In fees which is what we're making for 6 months

775
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,496
Right which is not sustainable 3guys cannot leave out that zeref yes go

776
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Straight

777
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,336
Are numbers jump to $400

778
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,944
In one week by week just from pictures and making a couple of

779
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Simply well

780
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
I worked at Nasa is there a bug in the system because that's just that's just crazy

781
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
How do we double in a week

782
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
And sure enough we're done more

783
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
Reservations with the house that we had met

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
Which was very interesting guy is that

785
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
We didn't know what's up

786
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
The time because New York

787
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
It's such an international destination

788
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,056
We have guests coming from Berlin we guess come from London from Sydney from Vancouver

789
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Cooper coming as guests

790
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
Experiencing this new service of staying in somebody's home

791
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
They go back to where they came from

792
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
And it's had this Epiphany moment Saha they go

793
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
Wait I have an extra room

794
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
Why don't I rent that on the site and they would sign up

795
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
And they would sign up

796
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Yeah

797
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
At what point did you were you able to

798
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
Actually

799
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Attract money from investors

800
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
Was it around that time

801
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
It's precisely around this time

802
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
What I've learned is that when the gears start to click

803
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Investors can hear that

804
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
And they actually this time they came to us

805
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
And we get offers coming in from

806
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
A variety of different groups

807
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
And the one that shocked us the most was Sequoia capital

808
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
Which was a print it is a preeminent

809
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
Venture Capital firm

810
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
In Silicon Valley

811
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
That we thought well maybe one day

812
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,792
Like a year from now we'll go talk to them but actually they were not going to her.

813
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
Yardworks talk to us

814
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Closing a deal with them

815
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
We got our first round of financing which

816
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
She'd relief

817
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
We can pay rent comfortably and we can hire start tired team

818
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,224
Corning it at what point do you remember

819
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Sitting with

820
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
With name Brian

821
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
I think this is going to be really big

822
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
Well one night

823
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
This isn't it

824
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
2010

825
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
It was probably like 11:30 at night is really tired

826
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Mathia

827
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
This point we have an office

828
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
And I used to look at every listing that got added to Airbnb

829
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
I would go through it at night and just click through

830
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Each of them

831
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
And I come across is one that says

832
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Fiji Islands

833
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
Unlike

834
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
What's that

835
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
I click on it

836
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Ensure

837
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
Somebody out in the South Pacific

838
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Listed

839
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
A 5-acre private island

840
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Recite

841
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
Complete with personal chef

842
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Complete with

843
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Water sports

844
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
And I'm looking to the photos of thing going

845
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Holy cow this is me

846
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Rideable

847
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,424
And it was in that moment realize the power the spot forum

848
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Is that weed we put it out there and

849
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
The creativity of the people who have

850
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
This contributed back to it

851
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Has gone beyond

852
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,760
Any of our expectations

853
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
So you guys have obviously grown much much bigger since then

854
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
Bigger than than most

855
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,744
Are all hotel chains

856
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
And you have some similar challenges to two companies like uber

857
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,448
I'm with some City saying hey you know you guys should be regulated like hotels

858
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
So how do you

859
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
How do you respond to that

860
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
I think about that question

861
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
In the context of Innovations over the last hundred years

862
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
End

863
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,760
There are three examples that come to mind of new ideas that entered the world

864
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
That had

865
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
Pretty rough start

866
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
Butter now so commonplace in everyday that you'd laugh

867
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
You thought like

868
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,464
Oh wow like people ready instead of one point

869
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
So ATM machines

870
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
At one point in

871
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
I think it's the 1970s

872
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Wer

873
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Had a lot of criticism

874
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
I think the Roxy laws

875
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Being written against them

876
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
In certain States. The US

877
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
It was this new and different way

878
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,616
Baking are you have to go inside and then

879
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
And talk with her

880
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,504
Person behind the desk of you. Maybe Up Cellular Services you just went to

881
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
A computer in a wall in in

882
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Retrieved money of course

883
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
Can I retrieve it at ATM machines

884
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
I know

885
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,744
The VCR thing is another great example was first patented in

886
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
Mid-twentieth century

887
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Become a product until

888
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
The 80s early 80s

889
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,752
Because it was met with such resistance from incumbent industries that didn't want people to

890
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Watch movies at home

891
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
The car is another example where

892
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
When the Model T came out 1908

893
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
Represented a new way to travel

894
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
But anyway to

895
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
The new form of transportation

896
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
And there were certain cities that were against the car

897
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
And they're actually

898
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
Laws drafted to

899
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
2

900
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Outlaw cars

901
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,144
But you know after a year of trying a new more efficient way of transportation

902
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
Are the people demanded that they didn't want to go back to horse and buggy

903
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
And so the policymakers you know

904
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
How to

905
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Modify

906
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
The lost it to what people want

907
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Cancel

908
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
I think the world is ready for our invention

909
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,272
Given that has been over a hundred million people have stayed in homes all over the world

910
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
End

911
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
The good news is that our cities come

912
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
To learn about what we do and what we offer

913
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
But they tend to want to work with us

914
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,512
Because they see that there's an economic economic impact that

915
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Allows

916
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
People in their cities

917
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
Different neighborhoods

918
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
2

919
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
To benefit

920
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
When you

921
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,008
I think last year Airbnb was

922
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Value

923
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
20 billion.

924
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
Probably more

925
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Today

926
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Is that

927
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,968
Crazy to does that shock you when you think that

928
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,320
You just started this thing and it is an idea that really went nowhere for the first

929
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Couple years

930
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
In your apartment in San Francisco

931
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
And it's not worth

932
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Billions

933
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
B

934
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Does it mean anything to you or to you is

935
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Is it just a number on a piece of pie

936
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
I don't think about it too much

937
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
I mean

938
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
The things can change if you look at the first.com

939
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
But you know what

940
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Garden Georgia

941
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
I was so enthralled by

942
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,200
Every day there was a new story of a new company that started in Silicon Valley or San Francisco

943
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,504
I planted a very deep sea

944
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
With me that one day I want

945
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
To be a part of that

946
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
So I also remember in

947
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Thefirst.com of companies that were

948
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Here today gone tomorrow

949
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,072
Yeah there's there's a list of 10 of the hottest companies from the 1990s

950
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
One of which you would still remember

951
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,680
It's because technology moves so quickly

952
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
But if you're not thinking about what's next

953
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
The world around you can change faster than you do

954
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
Joe gebbia founder of Airbnb since this episode first Ram last fall ever

955
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:24,672
Wendy's value has jumped to 31 billion dollars and in the second quarter of 2016

956
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
The company finally turned a profit by the way that company he first tried to build

957
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
Which is a butt cushion for art students this was a real business for a while there is still a website

958
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
And every now and then order still comes in and I still run down to the garage and pack them up and down

959
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
Do you have in your garage

960
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
It's a funny thing cuz it reminds me of like where I started and eyes is very grounded

961
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:03,072
What's the website is it is it crippin. Com

962
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
Only 600 left

Hey thanks for staying with us because it's time now for how you built that

973
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,392
Check back with the very first startup we had on this part of the show a company

974
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
It is taking on a very tough problem

975
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
We could actually refer to it as trash juice trash juice juice juice

976
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Which is the runoff from dumpsters and garbage trucks Urban dweller you walk by and you

977
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
Smell it and you do not want to go anywhere near that location of Michael vanity and its Partners came up with a device to put a

978
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
Stop to trash juice

979
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
Before it even starts

980
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
Think of it as a utility cart there is a hundred foot hose on it and when you pull the trigger at the end of the toe

981
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
Telos phone comes out of it

982
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
Scrubbing Bubbles x 1000 in these Scrubbing Bubbles are, like the secret magical ingredient here

983
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Michael says

984
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,424
They're full of bacteria that eat up all the

985
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,728
Junk in dumpsters and in trash chute

986
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,592
And then the phone kind of evaporate so you don't even need water to clean it up and

987
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
No water no trash juice

988
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:57,759
We test out the product we got incredible feedback and

989
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:03,135
The maintenance guys they like you guys just cut my cleaning time in half

990
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,535
Michael's company is called TP phone and since we spoke with him last year he sold about 200

991
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:15,935
Cleaning cards and gallons and gallons of the garbage eating phone customers are property

992
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
Managers across the country and Michael says the company's doing well but it's costing him a lot of money

993
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:28,735
Need to get the word out I mean a perfect example is we have a really big customer one of

994
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,575
The largest real estate developers and property management companies in the entire country

995
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,975
And they invited us to come to an event in September is very expensive and very far out of our budget but if the biggest

996
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
On the Block invite you to come

997
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
You have to say yes you just have to figure out how to do it that event he's talking about

998
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
It's a trade show in Texas

999
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:54,335
And Michael's company is in New Jersey and the ship one piece of equipment might cost tooth

1000
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
$1,000 so that's the big thing for us because we're equipment sales is not software or anything that's it

1001
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
It's in a little briefcase

1002
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
Way to be kind of very strategic where we're going to go but so far Michael says TV film is doing a pretty good job

1003
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
Job managing cash flow since January companies down about $400,000 in sales

1004
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
And he's not turning a profit

1005
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
But if you ask Michael what he thinks about the whole thing a cracked nipple.

1006
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,775
Because I used to be in the modeling business

1007
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,127
I was never model but I used to be on the business side of it and very glamorous world

1008
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
And

1009
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
Now I

1010
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
Hang out in the trash rooms

1011
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
But I loved every second of it

1012
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:41,439
That's Michael vanity of pp foam in Mount Laurel New Jersey

1013
