Portland Oregon

24
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
You can also follow how I built this on

25
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544

And out

28
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
To see you in Portland

29
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
I knew that something wasn't right and the next day they said that by you

30
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
They decided to replace me and George we put your furniture in

31
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Storage and I remember thinking my furniture and my nick-nacks 40 years

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Up stuff that I had accumulated and 50 cartons were put in storage

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
In the moment it felt like well damn if all these people who are my friend

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Don't want me as their leader anymore then why do I want to be their leader

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Grumman tr2 how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Stories behind the movements they built

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Turn discounts into a multibillion-dollar Empire

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,016
Bitter battle that forced him

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,672
Chowking retail fashion

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
There are three main categories of customers

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
Obviously this is a slight oversimplification but

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
It goes a little like this

43
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
There are products for the top end of the market so think like a Birkin bag by Hermes

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
It costs around $20,000 in Arabic

45
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
It's only going to sell a small number of them a year

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
SL500 Birkin bags a year that's 10 million dollars in revenue and then there's the lower it

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm so old lady for example a huge number of consumers can afford to buy their clothes and so they say

48
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Sell a lot of stuff

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
T-shirts jeans button-downs for like 20 or 30 bucks a piece

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,168
There's a clear strategy with each approach

51
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Store fashion brands can really hit the big time

52
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
Is in the middle range so imagine a Venn diagram of a person

53
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
Well now it again but also Target

54
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
That is a customer most fashion brands are hoping to attract the value shopper

55
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
White sound intuitive and obvious

56
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
That wasn't always the case if you wanted a suit for example in the 1960s or 70s

57
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:22,240
Settle for something that looked and felt

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Well cheap inside George Zimmer had back in the early seventies when he was

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
The young suit salesman

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Good suit was out of range for a lot of men and by the way George

61
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's mention really hated shopping for clothes

62
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
And when they did they wanted to do it once maybe twice in a year so what

63
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
A place that solve this problem

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,240
A place where you could get a pretty solid suit at a good price but also a place that made it

65
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
Super easy to get in and out fast a place where while you were trying on your suit

66
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,528
The salesperson would come back to the dressing room with a stack of hand-picked button-down size socks

67
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
And shoes

68
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
To go with that suit

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
And the place that would do all the alterations on site

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
This was the idea behind Men's Wearhouse in what started out as a single shop in Houston

71
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
What eventually turn into a multi billion dollar clothing Empire with hundreds of stores across the U

72
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
George became the face of that Empire you probably remember those commercials of them back in the day

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
George would look at the camera and say

74
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
You'll like the way you look I guarantee it

75
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,343
But overtime is personality is charisma his vision

76
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,231
It created tension with the management and with the board and as you will hear

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
They threw them out

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
And they was ugly

79
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
But we'll get there

80
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
George Zimmer grew up in Scarsdale in New York

81
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,031
His dad worked for a discount men's clothing company called Robert Hall so obviously

82
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
Deadhead a huge influence

83
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
But it was his mom who really played an outsize role

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Literally life

85
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
My mother

86
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
What is a

87
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Truly remarkable

88
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Woman

89
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
And she had both

90
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Amazing

91
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Strengths and qualities

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
That made us all proud

93
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
And then she had her own

94
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Demon

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
Many of them connected to having been

96
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
An orphan which does carry

97
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
It's on baggage

98
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
But what she did for me

99
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Which is

100
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Something that

101
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
I didn't appreciate

102
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
When she was alive

103
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
But what she instilled in me

104
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Was

105
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
This notion

106
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
That I was a

107
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
Special

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Boy

109
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
And I would be able to

110
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
To do anything

111
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I chose to do

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
In life and I must say

113
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
I've been a legend in my own mind

114
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
For decades

115
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
That's why I think we all know now

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Confidence

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Positive quality

118
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
I mean you say your mom and still this idea and you that you are special

119
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,063
Did you feel that when you were a kid that was assuming that because she said it you started to believe that

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
The truth is that I did not

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
But I think that

122
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Because of her

123
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Consistency in the way she

124
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Handle this issue

125
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
That it did.

126
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
Enter my subconscious

127
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
And by the time I got the

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
The college

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
And shortly after college

130
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
I felt very confident

131
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
What about

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Almost anything I tried

133
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
So you a 1966 ego off

134
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
College

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
The Washington University in St Louis

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
What do you remember about washing University

137
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
At the time I mean this is like

138
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
The height of

139
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
The Free Speech movement at Berkeley and student activism in the anti-war movement and what was

140
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Sit like at Wash U

141
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Well and it was fantastic

142
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Often felt at the time that you spend in college

143
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
If you're fortunate enough

144
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Can be the most

145
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Positive

146
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Years of your life

147
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
For me

148
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
I went to college

149
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
A sheltered

150
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
Young Jewish boy from New York

151
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
And

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
Because of what was going on in the streets

153
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
I became

154
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Much more

155
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Obey

156
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Sophisticated

157
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
And politically aware

158
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Person

159
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Okay so you're at Wash U

160
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Studying economics

161
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Right and meantime back in Scarsdale

162
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Your dad's business

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Making clothing

164
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
How is it doing

165
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
Well when I went to college

166
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
His business

167
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Wasn't it

168
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Ascendancy

169
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
But he never really

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Mastered

171
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
The art of making a

172
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Prophet

173
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
In business

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Although he did make

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Small profit

176
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
You never really

177
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
In my opinion

178
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
Took advantage of what he might have been able to achieve what was your dad making clothes

179
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,431
Was he making inexpensive boys

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Outerwear like what we called

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Snorkel jacket

182
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Out here they would be called

183
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Ski jackets nylon

184
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Shell

185
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Yeah you also made more of an upscale

186
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Boys raincoat

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
And when John John

188
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Kennedy

189
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
Was standing at his father's funeral

190
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
And that

191
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Famous boat owners

192
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Salute

193
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
He's wearing my father's raincoat

194
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Wow

195
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
Amazing I mean anyone listening can picture that image presumably he was manufacturing all

196
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
Call this in and around Scarsdale this is like the pre make your stuff in China era

197
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,207
Right well he ended up asking me in

198
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
Late 71

199
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,143
Since I had not gotten a job of any note I was substitute teaching

200
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
And my father and recognizing

201
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
His son was in danger of

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Drifting away

203
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Become a permanent hippie

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Said to me

205
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Why don't the two of us

206
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Go to Asia

207
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367
Because he wanted to look into manufacturing there instead of

208
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
The greater New York area

209
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
And when I came back to New York to make that trip

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
He informed me that

211
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
Something come up and eat couldn't do it

212
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
But he wanted me to go

213
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
In his stead which I did

214
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Really that's

215
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Beginning of Maya

216
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Business

217
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Experience

218
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
So 1971-d says Hey I want to think about making my stuff

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
In Asia can you go there

220
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Where did you fly to

221
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
Why Pluto Osaka

222
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
My first stop

223
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
And we get to

224
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
What was known as Idlewild Airport

225
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Alexandrite JFK right

226
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
It was called Idlewild

227
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
And

228
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
It was PanAm one

229
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Flying from New York

230
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Through Fairbanks Alaska

231
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
To Tokyo

232
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
And then I was switching

233
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
I'm flying down the wall soccer

234
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Alright so you fly

235
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
From

236
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
New York

237
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
5 Fairbanks in Tokyo

238
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Get to Osaka

239
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
What are you are you

240
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,743
Is 23 years old a tendon were you like a

241
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Presentable

242
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Were you

243
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
I was presentable

244
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
I told my father when he told me he wasn't

245
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
Making the trip that I didn't really

246
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
Understand is business well enough

247
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
To do this on my own

248
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
A Twitchy said

249
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
George they're going to love you in Asia

250
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
Because you're my

251
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Elvis trial

252
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Your number one son

253
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
And they're going to love the fact

254
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
That you're doing this

255
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Because I can

256
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
So I would get up every morning

257
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
At about 5 in the morning

258
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
And start studying

259
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Because I literally

260
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Didn't know

261
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Much about the manufacturing

262
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Of clothing in

263
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
I would study from

264
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Usually five to eight including

265
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Going to the

266
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
Breakfast restaurant in the hotel

267
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Which were

268
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
White glamorous

269
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
And

270
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
He was right

271
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
A lot of people

272
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
We're very

273
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Excited

274
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
To talk to

275
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
The number one son

276
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,119
Who had made such a long trip because his father could make

277
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
And you were there on a fact-finding mission right you were looking for potential factories to work with

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Yeah

279
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
My job

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
What's the fine

281
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Factories

282
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Give them samples

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
To make right

284
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
And then send them back to New York

285
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
And be sort of the middleman

286
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Got any he was making

287
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
The decisions

288
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Of course it was always about

289
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Negotiating a price

290
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,095
The exact Fabric and I lived there for about 6 months old I ended up

291
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Settling

292
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
In

293
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Hong Kong

294
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
So did you find a factory that you decided this is the one that's going to work no I did not I found many

295
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
Factories that made samples

296
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
Which I dutifully sent back to New York

297
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
But

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
We didn't find

299
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
Any Factory that we could make a deal with

300
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
So after about six months

301
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
I came home and dog

302
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
When I got back to

303
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
New York

304
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
It was the 72 presidential

305
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Election

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
And I actually got a job

307
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
In the McGovern campaign

308
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,103
Working in Chicago in the summer of 72

309
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Charged up

310
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
What was called Grassroots fundraising

311
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,551
And I remember I moved to Texas on Election Day

312
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
1972

313
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Why

314
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
My father offered me a job

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Dallas rapping is lying

316
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
Texas Oklahoma Louisiana

317
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
So you get back to the US

318
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
You work on the

319
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
McGovern campaign for a brief

320
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Yeah

321
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
And then your dad sends you to Dallas

322
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
To represent

323
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
Him and his clothing company but why Dallas what

324
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
The

325
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
The rap He had there at

326
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Quit so he had reps all over the country

327
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
And they were what that they would what would they do good

328
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Department stores department stores

329
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Specialty stores

330
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
By this time he had a

331
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Thriving business

332
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
And

333
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
He was doing well

334
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
And I

335
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Thought it was an opportunity to

336
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Continue my

337
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Carle careers

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
And I like living

339
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
In Dallas

340
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
It was fun

341
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
So you moved to Dallas in 72 and what

342
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
You start going to make an appointments and try to

343
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,879
We are making these raincoats and these jackets and you know

344
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
First 6 months

345
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
Okay I traveled the territory

346
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
Texas Oklahoma Louisiana

347
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
And the largest account

348
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
In my territory

349
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Was in Houston

350
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,287
Which is where I ultimately started Men's Wearhouse is the account called Foley's

351
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
It was a Federated Department Store

352
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
And I went in and soul

353
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Boys buyer

354
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
Sport coats

355
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
That were

356
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
I did my opinion

357
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,975
The correct workout you should have bought but I was too new on the job

358
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
To speak up

359
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,095
Let him make the order because it was in water sure

360
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Then when they didn't sell

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
He told me

362
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
That he knew my father was the owner

363
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Any like to return the coats

364
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
And I said well

365
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
We don't take anything back and he reminded me

366
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
That I could pick up the phone

367
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
Call my father

368
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
And get it done which I did

369
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
And we took back about 400

370
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,303
Or codes and you promised that you would give me a

371
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,911
Large order going forward and when I came in to get that order

372
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
A few months later informed me that they were dropping me

373
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:46,175
So I had about a 5-hour drive from Houston back to Dallas and

374
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
I decided that they didn't really understand

375
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Not a retail apparel not only in Foley's but throughout my territory

376
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
I didn't think that they understood the idea of discounting which was really more

377
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
Northeast add to some degree in Chicago

378
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
But had not gotten into the South

379
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
I'm so what I decided to

380
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
Relocate from Dallas to Houston

381
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
And open the first Men's Wearhouse

382
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Or maybe it was

383
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
I am truly

384
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
I mean you are

385
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Your dad's rap

386
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
In Dallas

387
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
For 6 months or 6 months

388
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
And

389
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
You lose an account

390
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,839
And at some point you say

391
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
You know what I want to open up my own

392
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Place

393
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,287
How did that happen how did that idea even come to you I'll tell you

394
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Having been a

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Student activists in college

396
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Having been somebody that

397
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
Did not believe that capitalism

398
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
Was the end-all-be-all

399
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
2

400
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
What we needed

401
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
I did not like the idea

402
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Having to execute

403
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Nachos my father

404
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
But the sales managers

405
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Vision

406
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
I always wanted to be able

407
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Do have my own dreams

408
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
And the follow my own dreams

409
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
And so the reason I

410
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
The primary reason

411
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
I open Men's Wearhouse

412
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Was

413
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
That

414
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
That it was a way for me

415
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
To become

416
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
My Own Boss

417
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Create my own destiny

418
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Follow my dreams

419
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
Okay so you are roughly 25

420
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
And what was her

421
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
A younger okay and before you even opened up Men's Wearhouse

422
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
What was your idea why did you think that suits

423
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
It was the right thing to get into

424
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
Well suits was what I knew

425
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,383
But how was it that you knew suits I mean was

426
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,247
Cuz I am understanding is that your dad's primary business was making clothing for boys

427
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
He'll expanded

428
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
So that is product assortment

429
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
We're

430
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
Outerwear like snorkel jacket

431
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Lisa

432
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Raincoats that have

433
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
Zip out linings that were

434
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Fairly upscale

435
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
And then he started a line

436
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
Of Enix

437
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Expensive

438
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Suits and Sport

439
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Right

440
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
And did you wear suit yourself

441
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
I almost never wore a suit

442
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Until I went to Hong Kong

443
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,783
Why did you think the Houston was the place to go yeah

444
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
While I was living in Dallas

445
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
And going to Houston

446
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Every month

447
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
And the way I explain this

448
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Is that

449
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Dallas was old money

450
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Houston was new mama

451
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
So that

452
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
For a young upstart

453
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Like myself

454
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
Trying to

455
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Create a business

456
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
The chances were much greater in used

457
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
And in fact

458
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
Since I didn't really know anything about

459
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
The retail business when I open

460
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
Men's Wearhouse the only reason

461
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
That I was able to make it

462
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Was Gus the city's growth

463
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Was so extraordinary

464
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
That it

465
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Coppertop for

466
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
What I didn't

467
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Understand

468
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Okay

469
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
So you decide

470
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
You are going to open up

471
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
A store that sells

472
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Discount

473
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Suits

474
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
In Houston in 1973

475
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
Did you start the company by yourself or did you do it with somebody else

476
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Well noise

477
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
The way I'd I started it was

478
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
Harry Levy it been my

479
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Fraternity brother

480
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
I know it was from Dallas

481
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
And I

482
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Call them up and said

483
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Would you like to move to Houston

484
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
And do this with me

485
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
And he said

486
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
What's in it for me

487
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
And I said well I give you a

488
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Third of the company

489
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
43 Grant

490
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,031
Nice and how did you guys get the money to open up for store

491
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
So I got my inventory

492
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
From my father he became

493
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
My financial partner

494
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
The inventory wasn't suit slacks

495
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
And shirts better and jacket sets

496
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
And boy that worked was

497
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
That I had only $7,000

498
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,047
When this all began and that basically went

499
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
The first and last month

500
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Rent

501
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
So there was really no money

502
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
As the company got ready to open

503
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
My father sent us

504
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Several thousand

505
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Suits

506
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Sport coats

507
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
And slacks

508
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
As well as

509
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
80

510
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Boss Steel

511
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Rolling Rock

512
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
Which is what we use

513
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,207
Thrift Store Fixtures in the bible store

514
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
How big was that place

515
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
It was 6000 feet

516
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,607
So big place yes rent in Houston with a cheap

517
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
Well it was 3500 a month

518
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Got it all right so

519
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,543
1973 Yuan Harry open the store Men's Wearhouse

520
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
Had to go well I remember

521
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
The first Saturday we were open

522
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
For business

523
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
We ran an ad

524
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
In the yard

525
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Houston Chronicle

526
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
And in the Houston Post

527
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
We were selling sport coats for $25

528
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Slacks for $10

529
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
And did not carry suits

530
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Or shirts

531
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Work by

532
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
We're up tailoring fact our first

533
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Cash register

534
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Was a mechanical

535
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Old style NCR

536
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
That you would push the buttons

537
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
And it would come up in the window ya no sale

538
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,016
And that was how we started

539
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
And was it a hit right away

540
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
Well we did 3000 the first

541
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
Saturday and Monday we did $60

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
And so I would not say it was a success right away. Would you guys free

543
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
About that Monday no

544
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Because my mother

545
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Had always

546
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Promise to me

547
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
That these things would work

548
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,688
So you are you guys are running this place and

549
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Doesn't sound like it was

550
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,344
Throbbing decide when I first day it doesn't sound like you guys were really Breaking the Bank you know

551
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Tune

552
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Just crushing in those first two years

553
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
We weren't

554
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
We lost money in each of the first two years and then

555
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,936
We opened our second and a third store in Houston

556
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
Explain this to me you're losing money on the 1st store

557
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
But you go and you decide to open a second and

558
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Third Store

559
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Thinking that those will

560
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Help you make more money

561
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
The marketing

562
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
In a major

563
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Urban area

564
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
Are so high you can't really run

565
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
A single location

566
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
You need multiple locations when did you expand into jackets and ties and suits and

567
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Belts and things like that

568
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
We started to get into

569
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
A broader product

570
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Assortment

571
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
In the mid-to-late 70s

572
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
We first went right

573
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Just suits

574
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
And we had a salesperson he was the

575
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
EVP

576
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
For our chapter in March

577
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,160
Based in Chicago that was what they were America's largest

578
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Clothing manufacturer

579
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
And

580
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
He came to see us

581
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
And I said to him

582
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
They had the line Nino

583
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Cerruti

584
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
And I said we'd like to buy that line

585
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
From you

586
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
And they said forget about it

587
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Did I sell

588
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Foley's iSell

589
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
And I said well let me tell you the whole story

590
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
We want to buy the line

591
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Without the label

592
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
But we wanted 20%

593
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Discount

594
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,392
Sobia white-labeled Men's Wearhouse

595
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Nino cerruti suit but you would

596
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Put your label on

597
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Correct and he said

598
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
He said

599
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
Why would I do that

600
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
And I said you know Kenny

601
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Why do we play a game

602
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Nevada basketball

603
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
And if I can beat you

604
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,080
You'll give me that d off and if you beat me

605
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
I won't bother you again

606
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
The rest is history you beat him in the game

607
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
I beat him and we got

608
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Nino cerruti suits

609
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,392
White label without a 20% purchase discount

610
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
Which enabled us to sell them moderately profitably at 1

611
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
199 when everybody else in America with showing them at 299

612
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
That was the acid

613
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,944
So I guess we'll wait for our chapter and marcher or any of the clothing manufacturers to sell more their suits

614
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Play white label them

615
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
Even if they were selling to a lower price

616
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Exactly

617
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
When did you first expand outside of Houston

618
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
In 1980 I came out

619
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Did the Bay Area

620
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
On a vacation

621
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
And we were planning on opening up

622
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
In Dallas

623
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Hazard

624
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Next

625
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Market

626
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
And I walk in New

627
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
Either Ruth Watkins or

628
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Some other

629
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Bay Area

630
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Store department store

631
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
No it was a men's menstruacao

632
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
Clothing store

633
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
And it was not a

634
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Regular price

635
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
100%

636
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Wool

637
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Suit

638
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
4 under

639
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
$300

640
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
We were selling

641
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
100% wool suit

642
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
For 199

643
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
So I

644
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Went back to

645
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Houston Inn

646
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
Gold my team that

647
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
We could pick up Dallas

648
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Later

649
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
And we were going to go right to the Bay Area

650
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Before things change

651
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Where in the Bay Area

652
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
So we started

653
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
In the South Bay we opened in

654
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
Mountain View

655
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
San Jose

656
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Fremont

657
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
And then we have one store

658
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Opinion

659
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Concord

660
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
So this is in the early 80s

661
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Techboomers really

662
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
Java beginner

663
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,448
Presumably your customers were

664
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
That professional man yes

665
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Mostly professional

666
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
And you opened up there and

667
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,968
What happened to people flock to it or or was it kind of again you know

668
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Mixed results

669
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
I would say mixed results

670
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
We were not

671
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Really success

672
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Until

673
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
The mid-80s

674
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
In my opinion

675
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
What happens in the mid-80s

676
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
To make

677
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Men's Wearhouse

678
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Really successful

679
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Well we were

680
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Put under

681
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
Giraffes

682
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Our bank

683
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
And not taxes

684
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Call Tower Loan

685
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
And so we were putting

686
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,736
Difficult position they called you alone cuz they were getting worried about you

687
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
No it's

688
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
In the early 80s

689
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
There was a

690
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
General meltdown

691
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
All the banks

692
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Mission Texas

693
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
And every Bank

694
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Including our bank

695
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
Which was the largest bank down there

696
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
First City National

697
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
All of them

698
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
We required

699
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Buy out of state bank

700
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Right now

701
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
So we had to rethink our business mod

702
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
So I looked at all Redmond

703
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
And by then it was on

704
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Computer

705
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Printouts

706
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
And I noticed

707
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
That on about

708
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Half of the inventory

709
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
There was a significant

710
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
Discrepancy

711
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Between the

712
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Ticketed price

713
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
And the selling

714
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
Meaning meaning what the selling price is much lower than what

715
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
The ticket price was

716
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Yes because of

717
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Promotional

718
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Activity

719
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
In other words you have a sale

720
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Correct

721
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
And you have regular sales

722
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
We did

723
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
So I made the decision

724
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
2

725
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Change the model

726
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
And eliminate

727
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Regular sales

728
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
You you decide

729
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,416
We need to stop holding sale

730
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
Lower our everyday prices

731
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Basically send out the message that we just

732
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
That we offer

733
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Low everyday price

734
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Exactly

735
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
When you made the decision

736
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
Did you have a year of

737
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,568
Slow sales two years one year of slow sales

738
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
I mean it sounds like it was

739
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,920
You have a combination of a bank calling in your loan

740
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Really low margins

741
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Sounds like this change in strategy

742
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Was kind of Hail Mary

743
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
Well I like the top is part of the

744
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Was

745
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Trying to

746
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
Suede people

747
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
That I knew what I was doing

748
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Because they were questioning

749
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,448
Whether I knew what I was doing how did you know that you knew what you were doing I did

750
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
So did that degree

751
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
You could call it a Hail Mary

752
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,616
But I had been in the retail business

753
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
For a while by then

754
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
And I had a

755
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Instinct

756
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
That this

757
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Made sense

758
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
It made no sense to me

759
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
This constant

760
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Garage

761
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Abseil

762
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
It was though

763
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
Everybody in retail

764
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,816
Thought that the American Consumer

765
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Was stupid

766
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
And actually

767
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
They're not as stupid

768
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,776

Welcome back to how I built this from NPR

806
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,216
It's 1986 and Men's Wearhouse is trying to pull out of an economic slump

807
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
George Zimmer

808
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,592
Just change the business model to focus on everyday low prices

809
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
Did get the message out

810
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
He decides to become the spokesperson

811
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
Are the commercials the Men's Wearhouse

812
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
You got all three

813
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Service

814
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Quality

815
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,208
And a good price George standing in front of what looks like a classroom

816
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
So what I did cuz we had training classes

817
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
Which I would give a presentation to

818
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
I found

819
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
I was very comfortable in those environment

820
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Sure so I said

821
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
Set up a fake training class

822
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
And bringing three cameras

823
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,432
Filming from different angles

824
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,040
And we will just bring in random office employees

825
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
Ask me questions

826
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
I will answer them

827
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,464
And we will edit it into a good message saying what

828
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Saying that we've got

829
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
Great suits and sportcoats

830
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Here's why

831
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
And oh by the way

832
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
They're Priced Right

833
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Clown

834
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,288
Why did you think that would be compelling I mean that sounds like the most

835
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
Boring real commercial ever come back

836
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
To my mother's

837
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Words

838
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
It never occurred to me

839
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
And I could say this

840
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
About

841
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Two dozen

842
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
Things in my life

843
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
That most people

844
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Would say

845
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
Did it occur to you

846
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
That that might not work

847
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
I go

848
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Quite frankly

849
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
Not really

850
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
So at what point did you order the

851
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Very famous

852
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Phrase

853
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
I think I ordered it in 86

854
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,152
And how did that happen it happened is an ad-lib

855
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
As I was at Living the commercial

856
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,856
I'm having an inner dialogue with myself while I'm

857
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Speaking

858
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Yeah I didn't have much

859
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Time

860
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Since I was in a

861
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Live recording

862
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
And all I could think of was

863
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
I guarantee it

864
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,168
The beauty of I guarantee it was

865
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Not so much

866
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
The words

867
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Cuz the words are

868
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
As happy as you're going to find

869
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
Yeah but I when I started walking around

870
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
In my regular life

871
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,992
People were saying to me

872
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Hey George

873
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
I guarantee it

874
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
And I knew a

875
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
That.

876
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Was catching on

877
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
But I also have known something else

878
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Which is

879
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,816
As long as people are calling me George

880
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
I think the companies

881
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
That I'm involved with

882
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Will prosper

883
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
If they start to call me

884
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Mr. Zimmer

885
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:51,872
I'll be worried so you essentially almost overnight become like the mascot

886
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Men's Wearhouse

887
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
I did

888
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,736
And if the benefit is

889
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
That when you are

890
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
A spokesperson

891
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
For your own business

892
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
Of course you're doing it

893
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,696
To affect the external

894
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
World you want more business

895
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
But what happened

896
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
Is that and we were in

897
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Retail business

898
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
With hundreds or

899
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Thousands of employees

900
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
The workforce

901
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Love the fact

902
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
That the boss

903
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Is on TV

904
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
I know

905
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
I know George George

906
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
PennDOT

907
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
It was a great day

908
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
Part of the company culture

909
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,904
Soap by the late 80s you are still in Houston and the South Bay

910
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
We are Bob

911
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,232
15 stores in the Bay Area

912
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
Where in Seattle Portland

913
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
Dallas Sacramento

914
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
And what I'm still trying to figure out why didn't

915
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,520
A bigger company try an undercut you I mean

916
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Clearly you got this

917
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,896
Thing going we are selling Nino cerruti suit people died Open Secret

918
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
That you were selling them for $100 less than a branded Nino cerruti suit without the label without the label but

919
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,440
If this is an Open Secret why wouldn't some other company come in and like Macy's or something company and try to do the same thing

920
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:14,560
Well I think that the answer is that many did

921
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
There were people that tried

922
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
The mimic what we did

923
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
But you know part of it is and I'm very

924
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Proud of this I I did it

925
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
All the training originally in men's

926
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
And I used to say to our employees

927
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
Men look at going into a clothing store

928
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,344
Like going to the dentist office so their wife says to them

929
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
I made you a dental appointment

930
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,000
And it's like the worst thing that the man can imagine

931
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
So they put off coming in to a clothing store until they can know

932
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
No longer

933
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Defer it any longer

934
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
And from that intuitive understanding we develop what we called

935
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Shirts talking

936
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
So that when a man purchased a suit

937
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,320
While he was in the dressing room we would put together

938
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,392
Church ties belt shoes

939
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Everything that would make

940
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,072
The outfit really jump then we presented to the customer

941
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
We were not in my mind

942
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,448
Pushy but we were

943
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Not passive

944
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
Yeah sales people either

945
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
The result was

946
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
That our customers thought

947
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
We had great service

948
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
Because they perceive this

949
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
As service

950
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
And it drove a lot

951
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Of Revenue

952
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,856
So basically man the thinking was Mendel want to spend a whole lot of time shopping

953
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
Jelly buying stuff

954
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Have to

955
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
Karate going to go into going to try on the suit in the and the

956
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Pants

957
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
But while they're in the dressing room where can I bring them

958
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
Like a pink shirt blue shirt and a white shirt were going to say

959
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
If you look right with a suit hear some great ties

960
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
And

961
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,288
And they would say thank you for making it easy for me I'm going to buy I'll take it all night walk out

962
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Exactly

963
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Wow

964
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,920
1992 you guys go public

965
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
The IPO brings in

966
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
A red light

967
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
13 million dollars

968
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
That's correct it doesn't sound like a whole lot for

969
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Well I was never

970
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Trying

971
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
To amass

972
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
The greatest Fortune

973
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
That I could

974
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
And

975
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
It turns out to have been

976
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
I think a very

977
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Good decision because

978
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
Although we had an IPO that only raised

979
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
13 million

980
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
We Dine at 4:05 second.

981
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
Each secondary

982
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Was that a higher

983
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Value

984
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,808
Secondary stock offering

985
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
They're kind of like IPOs

986
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
I think the 1990s really was when he

987
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,280
Blow up ride run your riding a really strong economy

988
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:00,192
What else is going on why I mean cuz you now are going to cities all across the United States right

989
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,032
Right so what's going on that allows this expansion yr

990
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
Consumer habits

991
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Changing

992
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
No I mean first of all

993
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
With the money that we got from the

994
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
IPO and secondary

995
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
We started opening

996
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,320
50 stores a year

997
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
Aura store every week

998
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:24,000
So if you can imagine each store Claus about a million dollars

999
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
In inventory

1000
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Insidious

1001
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
All lacrosse

1002
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
Write all 50 states

1003
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,240
You hit I think a billion dollars in Revenue in 98

1004
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,824
And then in the early 2000s the expansion

1005
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Continuous

1006
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,664
1999 you start to rent out

1007
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Tuxedos

1008
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
How did that happen What and why

1009
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
So where we were at a training class

1010
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,136
One of my regional managers at dinner with me inside

1011
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,952
You know Georgia I went into a few

1012
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
Tuxedo stores he was in Seattle

1013
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
And you said

1014
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
You know

1015
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
This is exactly what we do

1016
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Fat people in clothing

1017
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
Why don't we do this

1018
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
And you said

1019
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
I said let's try

1020
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
And yeah.

1021
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
12 stores up there

1022
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
And I the first year

1023
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
We did $1000000

1024
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,784
Tuxedo rental shop Brazoria

1025
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Inside the store

1026
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
Portneuf resection is light and it just said tuxedo rentals here exactly okay

1027
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,744
Everybody in my organization

1028
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Hated the sight

1029
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,376
Get why you doing tuxedo rentals We Gots every time you screw up a wedding

1030
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
You lose

1031
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
A customer

1032
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,520
You know this is not a way to build a clothing business

1033
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
So

1034
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,616
We rolled it out into our stores

1035
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
1/3

1036
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
1/3 1/3 / 3 years

1037
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
It took

1038
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
5 years

1039
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,600
Before the employees in the company

1040
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Stop complaining.

1041
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
About being in this business

1042
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
And I used to say to everybody

1043
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,304
And it was it got to be

1044
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Redundant

1045
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
Where I would say

1046
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
A look

1047
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Dishes

1048
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Going to take a while

1049
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
To develop but when it does

1050
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,336
It's going to be amazing

1051
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
And I guess there was a point

1052
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,432
I read that something like one out of

1053
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
5 suits in America was

1054
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Purchased at Men's Wearhouse

1055
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
Correct that is astounding download

1056
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Particular chapter because this is going forward to 2011 you step down as CEO of Men's Wearhouse

1057
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
House in

1058
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,376
Doug ewert becomes the new CEO

1059
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
And you picked

1060
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,240
I did I I've been

1061
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Why did want to retire

1062
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
And doggy been my

1063
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Siolo

1064
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:54,016
And I've been doing a great job so I said to him you know Doug our offices were next door

1065
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
I said I'm not retiring I'm going to come to work everyday yeah but you're running things day today

1066
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,000
And I'd like you to get credit for that

1067
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
You then become what chairman of the board Blackbird German executive chairman

1068
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Dedicate that I was still working

1069
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Just received a reality check

1070
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:21,408
After you made that decision to step out away from being CEO did you really disengage

1071
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,736
Company you found it in you started it did you really back away

1072
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,808
I never told dog what to do

1073
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,624
After he was made CEO

1074
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
I said to him dog

1075
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
You're the CEO

1076
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
It's your decision

1077
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,048
You make it the way you see it

1078
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
Okay now

1079
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
This is a moment where I guess

1080
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
There begins to be considerable tension

1081
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Between you and the board

1082
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah what started to happen

1083
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
What kind of

1084
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
Should have differences of opinion did you start to have with board member

1085
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,943
I don't really know exactly what happened because

1086
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
As it got closer to my

1087
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Termination

1088
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
I was cut out a more and more

1089
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
Of the discussions that the board

1090
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
What's happening

1091
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
But I give you a simple

1092
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Example

1093
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
We on the division call K&G

1094
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
Mkmg

1095
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Did 400 million

1096
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
We had a hundred stores

1097
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
It was a

1098
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Superstore in the sunset it was

1099
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
25000 ft

1100
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
And it was men's and women's

1101
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
And the price points were below

1102
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Men's Wearhouse

1103
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
And I said to the board

1104
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
Can you dream provides a unique opportunity

1105
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
For an offensive

1106
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
And defensive strategy

1107
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
And they didn't

1108
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
Quite understand what that meant

1109
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
And so what it means is

1110
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
Men's Wearhouse

1111
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Stores

1112
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
Were able to raise

1113
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
The gross

1114
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
Profit percentage

1115
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Buy a full 10%

1116
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
Which is 1000 basis

1117
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Over a decade

1118
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,247
Because

1119
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
K&G

1120
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
What's protecting

1121
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,879
Our opening price point

1122
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
And at the same time

1123
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
Because K&G

1124
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
Was a significant National

1125
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Presence

1126
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
It prevented

1127
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
Other stores

1128
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
From realizing

1129
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
That investing

1130
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
And low price clothing

1131
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
The way I had done in 70

1132
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
3 gallon

1133
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
Would make sense

1134
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
So

1135
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
Board and dog

1136
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Wanted to sell K&J

1137
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
And I told him

1138
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
That I would support them in selling it

1139
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
But I did agree with it

1140
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,231
Is hold with that type of decision

1141
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
And the board represented it

1142
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
In their public relations releases

1143
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
As though I was unwilling

1144
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
To cede Authority

1145
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
And I never

1146
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
Understood what they were talking about

1147
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Cuz I was

1148
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Totally explicit

1149
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
And not

1150
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
Explaining the dog

1151
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
That he was the guy

1152
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
All right June 19th

1153
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
2013

1154
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Yes

1155
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
You're fired from Men's Wearhouse as the executive chairman

1156
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
Yes or not the board

1157
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
This is the company that you founded

1158
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,839
In Houston in 1973

1159
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
What do you remember about

1160
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
Hearing that news

1161
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,007
Well it wasn't that long ago so I remember everything

1162
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,591
I remember that the lead director

1163
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
Wyatt put in the position

1164
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
6 ft 7

1165
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
Stood up which made him quite intimidating

1166
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
And said to me

1167
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,135
You know George the board by unanimous consent

1168
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
And went on to talk about getting rid of me but it when he said unanimous

1169
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,655
I'm in a room of France and I'm going

1170
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
Unanimous

1171
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
Mean I have Deepak Chopra

1172
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
As well as people that

1173
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
You don't know

1174
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
And I can't believe

1175
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,223
That it is unanimous cuz I have done so many

1176
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:14,367
Favors for all of these pizzas by unanimous consent were asking you to step down

1177
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,743
Woodforest they said to me we'd like you to become chairman emeritus

1178
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
And I said what is that may explain did

1179
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
It was a figurehead position

1180
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,727
I said when do you need to know they said by 10

1181
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:36,127
The reason why was that we were meeting as a board in advance of a

1182
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,175
You will share holder meeting

1183
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,527
And so they wanted to get me off the

1184
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,087
Perspectives as chairman of the board

1185
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
And they said they could do it

1186
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
If I notified them by 10 at night

1187
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
So we were in a hotel

1188
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,583
So I was just by myself in a hotel

1189
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
I in Fremont

1190
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,911
And

1191
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
I remember

1192
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,495
Being in my room and thinking

1193
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
You know my lawyer was

1194
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
Companies lawyer

1195
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Very few good friends

1196
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
Outside of

1197
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
The

1198
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Business

1199
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
And nobody to really talk to wow

1200
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Deepak came up to my room at

1201
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
And led me on a guided

1202
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Meditation

1203
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Because he was concerned

1204
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
That I wasn't

1205
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Taking into account my legacy

1206
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,167
You was right I wasn't valuing my legacy

1207
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
And what I was valuing was

1208
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
Do things out number one I said

1209
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Look

1210
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
I know I

1211
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
Told you that dog

1212
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Would be a good replacement

1213
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
But after a couple of years

1214
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
I was wrong

1215
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
He's not qualified to run the company

1216
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,927
That wasn't what Deepak wanted to hear

1217
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,743
And so the next day they said that

1218
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
You know

1219
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
By unanimous consent Theory but

1220
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
Decided to replace me in

1221
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
They said to me

1222
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
And George

1223
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
We put your

1224
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,263
Furniture in storage

1225
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
And I remember thinking

1226
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
You put my furniture in storage

1227
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
I mean my furniture in my knick knacks

1228
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
40 years

1229
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,783
Of stuff that I had accumulated

1230
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
1050 carton

1231
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
We're put in storage

1232
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
And in the moment it felt like

1233
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,743
Well damn if all these people

1234
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
Who are my friends

1235
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,351
Don't want me as their leader anymore

1236
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
Why do I want to be

1237
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
Their leader

1238
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,239
Obviously there's something not right here

1239
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Were you hurt

1240
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
By your friends

1241
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
Essentially rejecting you to do feel personally

1242
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Hurt

1243
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
No I did not

1244
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,295
It was not a complete surprise

1245
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
There's been a phone call

1246
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
About two weeks earlier

1247
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Where

1248
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,999
The compensation committee chairman and said to me

1249
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
We're going to leave you in your

1250
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
Position for the time being

1251
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
And I remember thinking to myself

1252
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
Who the hell are you

1253
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
Did tell me that

1254
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
But I knew that there was

1255
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
Something wasn't right

1256
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
But you're in

1257
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Tire life

1258
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,151
Your entire identity

1259
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
Everything you knew

1260
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
From the age of 23 24

1261
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Was Men's Wearhouse

1262
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,599
Yeah how could you not have been hurt

1263
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
By being

1264
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,951
I was out in this may not be satisfactory in

1265
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
But I don't get hurt

1266
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
The way you mean it

1267
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
I did not get depressed

1268
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
I did not go into this

1269
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Poor me

1270
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,727
Victim

1271
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
I mean

1272
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,079
I get it that you didn't feel sorry for yourself or that separate like

1273
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
It's your identity

1274
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039
And then one day you've got it you got an office to go to their people you know they're people you see or George or I guarantee

1275
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
And then the next day you don't have that

1276
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
That's a big deal

1277
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
Completely comfortable

1278
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
In my skin

1279
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
Almost all the time

1280
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,143
People are interested in what I have to say

1281
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,495
I feel I have a lot of respect

1282
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
From

1283
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
People I care about

1284
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
I see what happened in men's

1285
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
Has really an example

1286
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,991
Capitalism run amok

1287
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
Do you still keep in touch with any of those former board members

1288
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Not a one

1289
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,951
So so soaked to say you didn't take it personally is not really true

1290
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
Caldwell

1291
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
I feel

1292
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
That I'm a great friend

1293
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,727
And so when you hurt me the only way I have to get it

1294
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
Leaving is the with all my friendship

1295
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
And say that's it

1296
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:56,223
We're no longer friends and I no longer want to speak to you that's a normal human reaction

1297
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Yeah

1298
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Could be that

1299
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,087
You know wonder some sort of

1300
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,879
Therapy it would be

1301
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,439
Discovered that I am really white

1302
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Hurt

1303
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
But

1304
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
I don't feel hurt

1305
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,607
I got divorced after this happened

1306
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
The second time

1307
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:21,055
I have a great relationship with my children you know

1308
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
Watching politics

1309
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
In the evenings

1310
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
But I don't feel

1311
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
I don't know I think

1312
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Being hurt

1313
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
Is

1314
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
Very close

1315
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Feeling like a Vic

1316
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
And I just

1317
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Reject

1318
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Okay so

1319
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,487
After you left it

1320
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,047
Clear the way for Men's Wearhouse to make a cake

1321
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Couple of

1322
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:47,679
Significant decisions including acquiring Joseph A Bank for 1.8

1323
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Billion dollars

1324
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
Turned out to be a bad decision

1325
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
And the reason is

1326
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
Because

1327
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Men's Wearhouse

1328
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
Thought that the Joe Bank

1329
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Customer in the Men's Wearhouse

1330
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Customer word differ

1331
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Because

1332
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
Shirts.

1333
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
We were

1334
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
More aggressive

1335
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
In the selling price

1336
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
When you walk in with Joseph Bank

1337
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,047
They leave you alone

1338
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Dubrow

1339
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
What I found was

1340
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
That

1341
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
You do a lot less business

1342
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
With that strategy

1343
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Then if you have

1344
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
A knowledgeable

1345
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
Consultant

1346
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
Who is

1347
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Genuinely

1348
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
And helping the customer

1349
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,087
And whatever the customers lifestyle

1350
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
The company is

1351
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,439
How would you describe the company today from the outside

1352
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,487
Struggling do you own any

1353
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Chairs anymore

1354
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Appeal

1355
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,143
And do you feel a sense of satisfaction that they are struggling since your departure

1356
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
Yes and my new business

1357
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
Is

1358
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,775
Although we're a very small

1359
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
Relative to them

1360
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
We are compatible

1361
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,663
So so I want to talk about your new business a sackbut

1362
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
You leave Men's Wearhouse

1363
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,735
You're rich

1364
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
You can do whatever you want you can

1365
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
Go to Hawaii you can

1366
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,903
Hang out with your kids where it where you want to do

1367
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,743
Did you think about that doing that for some time try for 4 months

1368
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
I sat in my backyard

1369
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
Impede my beautiful

1370
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Flowers

1371
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,911
It was the summer

1372
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
And

1373
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
I thought

1374
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Treatises

1375
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
Doll Emporium

1376
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,079
My kids are in school

1377
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,127
My wife got her own life

1378
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
And I'm sitting in my backyard

1379
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
Looking at the flowers

1380
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Didn't make sense

1381
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
So I guess

1382
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
Pretty soon after this you come up with an idea for

1383
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,695
A new business which was an online tuxedo rental company called generation

1384
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Yes

1385
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,279
And you launch this in

1386
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:54,655
What September of 2015 right when the people from Men's Wearhouse found out about it

1387
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:02,079
Oh my God this letter was like I guess I guess you didn't sign anything cuz

1388
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
But you didn't pledge not to get by until you

1389
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,319
You know what men's is Dawn men's is afraid of me is what it must be

1390
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
Because after I was fired

1391
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,927
The first thing I tried to do

1392
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,719
What's by K&G

1393
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,071
From which was that retail company that they are you try to buy it from them

1394
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,631
490 million dollars okay

1395
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
What verse

1396
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
They wouldn't sell it to me at all

1397
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Then they said all right

1398
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
If you give us a four-year non-solicitation and I said what do you mean by that

1399
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:41,759
They said you can't fire or employer for 4 years

1400
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
And I said are you kidding I'll give you two years but for years

1401
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:52,255
Is an eternity deal never happened

1402
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
Did this day

1403
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
They still can't find anybody

1404
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,679
That would offer him half of what I was going to pay out

1405
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:04,543
That I had a relationship with Macy's

1406
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,359
And we were going to provide Macy's

1407
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,199
With the tailoring for there

1408
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:16,063
Online business not their stores their online business

1409
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
And as a lark

1410
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
I asked my local guide

1411
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
If they would have any interest

1412
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
Doing a tuxedo rental thing with us

1413
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
Yeah and within

1414
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
A few months

1415
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
My team and I were in New York

1416
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
In Terraria

1417
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Lundgren's office

1418
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
The CEO of Macy's

1419
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
Making a deal

1420
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,223
Tubidy tuxedo auxito

1421
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,759
Rental

1422
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,807
And we had the deal

1423
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,111
It went to Legal review

1424
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
And while it was in legal review

1425
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Men's Wearhouse stolen

1426
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,279
Because I could not get Macy's

1427
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,863
Do agreed with no-shop clause

1428
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,447
So they shopped it around my girl how would happen

1429
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
But the next thing I know

1430
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
Terry called me and said

1431
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,871
I'm very sorry George but we're not doing it by and I said

1432
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
Who are you doing it with

1433
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
And he said

1434
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
Didn't want to tell me it first

1435
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,575
The lady said Men's Wearhouse and I went

1436
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
You gotta be kidding me yeah

1437
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
And

1438
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,207
It doesn't make me

1439
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,743
Men's bowler

1440
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,791
Revengeful it

1441
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
It just makes me

1442
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,679
More determined to do what I know how to do

1443
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
What is the status of generation tux now

1444
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,103
I mean you started 2015 it took you over our first year of

1445
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,687
Profitability startled took a long time for Men's Wearhouse

1446
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
How to get to Welches

1447
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
Really gets a major problem

1448
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Much better

1449
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,575
And

1450
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
You go online and you

1451
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
Get a tux and you just

1452
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,487
Put your measurements in and it comes to you and then you wear and you send it back

1453
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Exactly

1454
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
And we do things like

1455
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,839
If you want any

1456
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Free home try-on

1457
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
Will do not only one

1458
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
To rearm dry on

1459
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
We do free swatches

1460
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,615
You know we do a lot of things that make our business

1461
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Strong and it's

1462
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Right now it's starting to really

1463
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
Fire on all cylinders

1464
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,831
George Gee you feel a sense of

1465
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
I don't know vindication

1466
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
That you were right

1467
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,535
About Sterling Shirley were wrong about sending in 1/4 wrong over the course of their career

1468
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
But I guess you were right

1469
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,887
And in certain ways you did not want

1470
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,471
Men's Wearhouse to acquire JOS A Bank in the like that model

1471
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
They did

1472
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
It hurt them

1473
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,871
Does being right is that important to you

1474
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
I think so

1475
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
Why

1476
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,015
Well I like to think that I'm right about

1477
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Manything

1478
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
I'm wrong about a few things

1479
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
But

1480
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Yeah I think that you know

1481
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,767
That there is a real problem in America

1482
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
I think that capitalism

1483
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Which clearly

1484
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,423
Won the battle over communism

1485
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,215
And even socialism

1486
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,519
Is need in need

1487
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
A modification

1488
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
And I'm a capitalist

1489
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,407
What the hell I've been my life making money

1490
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,967
But there are a few adjustments

1491
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
The capitalism

1492
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
That would make it sustainable

1493
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Which on Fortune

1494
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
I don't think it is sustainable

1495
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
Would one of those adjustments be

1496
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,999
Shifting the focus away from shareholders

1497
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Exactly

1498
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
That's what it's about

1499
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,839
It is always about short-term profit

1500
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Yeah

1501
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,935
When you when you look over the course of your career

1502
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
The ups and downs

1503
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
How much of your success do you attribute to

1504
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,103
Your hard work and your intelligence

1505
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
And skill and how much do tribute

1506
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
Black

1507
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,735
Just being lucky riding a lucky wave

1508
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,063
Well I think they go hand-in-hand

1509
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Another words

1510
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,391
I think you need

1511
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
Lock

1512
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
But

1513
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,231
You also need

1514
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,023
The talent

1515
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,303
And the

1516
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,327
Intelligence

1517
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351

1518
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
Know how to take advantage

1519
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,167
Uplock

1520
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,751
I think that what happens in life unfortunately

1521
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
Is

1522
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,591
A lot of people have the opportunity

1523
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
To be lucky

1524
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
But don't know how to take advantage of it

1525
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
And you did

1526
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,783
I did

1527
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
That's George Zimmer

1528
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,439
Founder and former CEO Men's Wearhouse George still runs

1529
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
Generation tux

1530
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:45,119
At some point I'm going to make you say it you know that right now. Right now you're going to like the way

1531
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
Way you look I guarantee it to put that as my phone ringer when I was

1532
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,383
At Men's Wearhouse I would go to

1533
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,687
Charity auctions

1534
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
And auction off doing that for $3,500 wow

1535
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,415
I would do it for you for nothing by the way

Built this

1548
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,415
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1549
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:46,815
Time now for how you built that and today we're updating a story we first ran about a year ago

1550
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:53,215
Begins around 1993 in Guinea West Africa

1551
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:58,847
And one of the things he has a kid with the sweet ginger e pineapple juice

1552
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,127
Call Ginger

1553
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
Which is a really popular drink in that part of the world we know you go buy a snacks on the side of the road you often have we know what

1554
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,671
Women that have a little cooler of ginger ale to a species like

1555
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:18,047
Lemonade or iced tea or maybe milk to a lot of the kids early childhood in Guinea was

1556
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:24,447
Pretty great but around the time I turned 15 the political situation in the country became unstable

1557
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
Able and unsafe

1558
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,823
Sara Haines parents sent him and his brother to the US

1559
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,223
Raheem overstayed his visa and was eventually caught by immigration officials

1560
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,319
And he ended up spending almost a year in detention

1561
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
Odyssey looking back at it

1562
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,439
It's now that I appreciate how difficult of a time you was

1563
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
Young and

1564
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
Too naive to understand how

1565
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:54,655
How much trouble I was in when he was eventually able to get a green card

1566
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,751
And then made enough money to go to Community College and then

1567
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
To Michigan State University

1568
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
The whole time he was missing home

1569
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:09,503
His mom his friends and even that pineapple drink you loved as a kid

1570
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,319
Yeah in Michigan when I'm playing sports

1571
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
When I'm running around in them

1572
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Really hot

1573
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,183
Summer that usually don't Pine for Coke

1574
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,487
I think about Ginger

1575
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,559
Can't find homemade pineapple ginger juice

1576
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Some African restaurants

1577
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:28,191
But you can't just walk into a chain store and buy that the Shelf

1578
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
Soul Train has Brothers.

1579
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,311
Maybe we should start making it and selling it

1580
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,615
And when they started doing research

1581
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
I mean

1582
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Seemed perfect

1583
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
You know what is that

1584
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
The traditional

1585
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
The Colts de Pepe

1586
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,575
Dalida the carbonated artificially flavored

1587
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Brian

1588
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,391
Market share

1589
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
The point where

1590
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:52,767
They have all started to buy a smaller companies that are developing

1591
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Fresh organic

1592
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,655
Biotics queso a great opportunity for something like ginger but

1593
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
As much as they love the stuff

1594
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,263
They did not know how to make it

1595
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
So

1596
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
They caught up their mom and guinea

1597
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
And ask for the recipe

1598
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
Fresh ginger

1599
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,687
Cold pressed pineapple

1600
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
All fresh lemon juice

1601
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
Vanilla

1602
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,575
Play this is all happening around 2014 and

1603
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,647
This point the two brothers are living in New York City

1604
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,231
Start mixing up batches of gingin in Bahamas apartment

1605
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:28,095
And Raheem Thursday give out samples to customers at the bar where he works

1606
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:34,495
Dell Triton boat to find a ginger to be too spicy or some folks to find it to have a little too much lemon or too little

1607
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Lemon

1608
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,383
Or the pineapple is not pronounced an hour for it is or later after trial and error

1609
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
Muhammad

1610
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
Guess the recipe exactly where they wanted

1611
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,271
They decide to Launch

1612
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Xinjiang

1613
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,087
At an African Festival in Harlem

1614
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,975
He was one of those moment to realize that we really want something everyone that came by that world from West Hartford

1615
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Nudo products

1616
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,351
Goodnight just buy one bottle you know it by

1617
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,167
2 3 take a picture and send it to a friend

1618
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,983
They sold out all of their bottles

1619
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
And then a really big break

1620
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
They wanted $25,000 the competition for budding entrepreneur so they moved into an industrial

1621
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
Real kitchen and eventually

1622
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,551
Play Pitch Ginger and Whole Foods and well

1623
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
We're definitely not less in terms of

1624
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Sewing them

1625
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,975
Because we knew Whole Foods wanted us to get a distributor and a distributor

1626
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,119
Was interested in us because they know we talk in the whole food so we kind of played them against one another

1627
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
And it worked out well

1628
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Since launching in

1629
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
