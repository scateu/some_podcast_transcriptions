20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
Whole Foods

Apple Store like with credit cards and Islam

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Long as you take them to where they want to go they will help you pay for the gas but if you don't take them

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
The more they want to go they will try to hijack the car and throw you out on the side of the road so I

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
I did not trust Avicii's I liked him I didn't trust him I did not want him to take control of the company so I thought no going to go public

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
And then we're going to get The Hitchhikers out of the car

Change the way Americans

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
Shop for grocery

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,560
If you happen to step into an organic food Co-Op in the 60s

38
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
70s

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
You would probably walk past

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Isles

41
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Isles

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Bulk bins full of

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
Beans and

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Brown rice

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Dried fruit

46
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
There were no

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Big Brands know

48
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Stonyfield Farms

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Are Nature's Path NOAA

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Annie's

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
And the people who shot me stores

52
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
They were monkeys

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Teeny tiny handful of Americans

54
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Who even knew what

55
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Kinawa or Taylor

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
And they were mostly

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Counter Culture types

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Hippies back

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Nature folks

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Mom

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
And yet all these people were at the Leading Edge of a food Revolution

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
That would start to sweep the country

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
In the 1990s

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
And that Revolution was

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Repelled

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
And even though that company inspires

67
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Pretty strong opinions

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Fanboys

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Heaters

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
There's no denying that it had a monster-sized impact on

71
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
The way we

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
We eat

73
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
But the person who is

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
Partly responsible for this revolution

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Well

76
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Here's what John Mackey grew up

77
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
How to start the day with

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Cocoa Puffs

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Endnote

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Pop-Tarts

81
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
Very picky eaters well so in hamburgers

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
For lunch with nothing on it for no vegetables on the hamburgers

83
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
Maybe fried chicken for dinner or macaroni and cheese out of a

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
The camera box

85
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
This was the era where

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
Stay-at-home moms were so thrilled about the

87
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Great innovations that

88
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Could happen like TV dinners

89
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Frozen TV dinners that you could

90
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Pop in the oven and

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Well I'd have a meal for your family

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Where were you in life

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
When you first

94
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Discovered

95
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Food

96
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Real food

97
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Yeah my food

98
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
Consciousness Awakening really

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Heard when I was about

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
23

101
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
And I moved into this vegetarian co-op in Austin

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Call Prana house

103
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
I was definitely interested in the counterculture

104
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
I'm finding it interesting women as well I thought it was a

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Amazon adventure

106
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Yeah

107
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Expanded my

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Diet from inside to become a vegetarian

109
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
And I became the food buyer for that Co-op

110
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
And

111
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
Then I had to get a job and I went to work for a small natural

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
We just weren't Austin caused a good food company

113
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
And wow

114
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
I'd like I was launched on my path

115
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
I loved everything about natural organic foods

116
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
I like cooking

117
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
I like retailing it

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
And I thought this is something I could really

119
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Be passionate about

120
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Okay at this point in your life you did not like you didn't have a

121
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
A college degree

122
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Kind of dropped

123
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Out of college

124
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
Yeah so when I was about 20 years old

125
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,471
I was on track to get a degree in Philosophy from the University of Texas

126
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
I ran into a course that was required course I needed

127
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
To complete

128
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
I didn't like the course I didn't like the books that I was required to read I didn't like

129
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Professor

130
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
And then one day the battle is over

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
And I stood up in the book I was reading or trying to read I threw it on the ground as I'm not going to read this book

132
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Then I just began to read books and take courses that I was interested in so I ended up with a hundred and twenty hours of elect

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
However just courses I was interested in but I took control of my life I began to be authentic and true

134
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
Treating myself and that led me into this whole natural food world

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
So when you when you show up into the sand in this coop

136
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
You have a college degree

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
I'm assuming

138
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
I don't like a hippie

139
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,975
Type of place is definitely your parents are super excited

140
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
How does the decisions you've made

141
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
At this point in life

142
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
23

143
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
No my parents were

144
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Very worried

145
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Very unhappy yeah

146
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,519
The very last conversation I ever had in my mother 1987

147
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Was on her death

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
Bad and she asked me to go back to school and make something of myself

149
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
I was a grocer I was a hippie grocer

150
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
And

151
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,343
She said anyway you have a fine mind John why are you wasting is a gross or go

152
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
A doctor or a lawyer do something with your life

153
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Makes a difference

154
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
So I said I'm doing something in my life that makes a difference

155
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
She said you're just a grocer

156
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
I said

157
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Mom grocery store grapes

158
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
What was it like like what

159
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
What was it like working at Whole Foods

160
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
I loved it I mean

161
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
The store wasn't very big with only couple

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
Car seat but the retail business was really fun I mean first on surrounded by food which I'm fascinated

163
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
With other people and I'm working with the other

164
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
7 radians work

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Torrent

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
They're also equally interested in food

167
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
There people that you get to no overtime and a small store with nothing about that many customers so you develop relationships with

168
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
People and you serve them and I just thought that was like super fine new

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
I can do this the sink within my realm of competence and then I worked for about 6 months and when I

170
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:17,247
Summa an idea grew in my mind which is this is what I want to do with my life I want to open I want to open my own store

171
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
I went back to the coop and talk to my girlfriend Renee she was four years younger than me so I think I was like 23 and she was

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
119 and she got super excited about and I often wondered if we made so that's a stupid I did let her work how my life might

173
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
Maybe different now but she was very excited about it and we began to plot out opening around store

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
How did you eat

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Maven get started

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Well

177
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
That wasn't easy

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
I make a joke about it now that

179
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
And entrepreneurs a little bit like a panhandler

180
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Except

181
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
That they're selling dreams to pee

182
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
We raise the money because we like most entrepreneurs friends and family

183
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
We thought we needed $50,000 to start the store

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
And

185
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
We can only come up with 45 but we decided we can make do with it

186
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
And

187
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
My initial stake

188
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
$10,000

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
What's the most

190
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
I ever owned the company

191
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
Antenna to 45000 and I borrowed all that for my

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
My father to with that money you were able to open up

193
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
That the first Whole Foods

194
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Well

195
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Original story called safer way

196
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
Thanks Safeway but safer way

197
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
And we truthfully we were always hoping that

198
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Maybe

199
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Safeway would sue us

200
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Are you good publicity

201
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
And

202
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Although selectors I had in school none of them were business class

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
No real

204
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
Business experience Renee didn't have any experience she was

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
How many open the store she was

206
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
2021

207
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
And

208
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
Wilton we open a store in an old house not even on busy road

209
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
It was just like

210
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
We just thought this was a super cool house so we

211
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
We had a

212
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Store on the first floor vegetarian storm

213
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
And we had a vegetarian restaurant on the 2nd

214
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Flora caffe

215
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
And then we have an office and we lived on the on the third floor

216
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
If you if you were to walk through safe

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,591
4-way what would you see on the shelves is it like bulk

218
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Products in Lake Mead was there sugar

219
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,807
Sure we didn't sell sugar we didn't sell meat

220
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
We were selling real foods we were selling bulk foods

221
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
And produce

222
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
And yes definitely everybody was a hippie

223
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
But we had about

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
Counting the people in the cafes a lot of networking top part time

225
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
20 people work at 15 to 20 people

226
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,775
So were you scared I mean you were you were still a kid

227
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
No

228
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
I wasn't scared at all you thought this was going to work

229
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
When your

230
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
You can when you're 24 25 years old

231
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,783
You don't have so much to lose I wasn't married I didn't have any

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Kids II

233
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
For my case the worst case scenario was

234
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
I would disappoint a lot of people

235
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
And

236
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
And do something else in life

237
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
I didn't for me was a grand Adventure

238
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Starting businesses

239
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Fun

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Fun because you're

241
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
You're engaged

242
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
You're passionate about it and

243
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
The whole

244
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
Dream just would have swept us along

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
And we didn't know what we were doing but

246
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
We learned very quickly

247
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
And

248
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
We got better

249
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
You must have burned through that 45,000 pretty fast

250
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
We did we actually lost half of it in the first year now

251
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
He lost $23,000 a year were you freaking out

252
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
No but the investors were

253
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
My dad was freaking iPad

254
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
But I'm

255
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
I just began to read books

256
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds I have red hundred coffee

257
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Thousand books

258
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Home businesses

259
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Since the beginning

260
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
I also

261
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
I'm an ottoman optic nerve by try things

262
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
But if something doesn't work

263
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
I stopped doing it

264
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Enabled us to learn quick

265
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Play and we did make a small

266
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
$5,000 profit in our second

267
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Year

268
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
How did you do that

269
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,351
Started managing our cost better started buying better

270
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Less spoilage

271
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Better management of labor hours

272
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
You know the very basics of retail

273
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,847
We didn't really know we had to figure it out

274
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Local

275
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
Hippies in Austin or what did you also have like sort of

276
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Austin High Society

277
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
So

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
One of the job site

279
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
I tell us because I run into people all the time

280
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Tell me they were original

281
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
Safer a customer can I say

282
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,607
You know half the people that said they were original saferway customers had

283
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
I've been there whenever we don't have five times the sales went up having

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
I like the number of people that went to Woodstock right there

285
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,199
But now they were all they were all young they didn't need four people this was the counterculture and part of the counterculture was

286
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
They wanted their own stores

287
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
I didn't want to go to that traditional

288
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Big supermarkets in very alien experience

289
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,743
Minsoo obviously it sounds like you guys were doing pretty well when did you when did you start

290
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Thinking about

291
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
You know

292
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Expand it

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Well

294
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
After about

295
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,983
When I began to make money to suck in urine began to realize that saferway was too small

296
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
And

297
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
I just thought we needed to have a bigger better location so I began to dream about opening a real

298
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
Grocery store where you could do all your shopping there

299
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Yeah

300
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
So

301
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
We found this location

302
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
Was this whole nightclub

303
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
On a big strip Road in Austin Lamar

304
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
That it had burned down in the crowded been a night

305
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
So

306
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
I first had to try to sell our our board on it

307
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,983
And try to get more money and they said this is crazy you lost half the money the first year and this is great you're making money now but

308
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
I want you to stay there for a few years and then

309
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
And I will see

310
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,175
If I know really got to do got to do a bigger store work

311
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Not well positioned competitively

312
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
But they weren't buying it

313
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
And

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
More like I said look when I want to put more money in but maybe I can find somebody else

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Turn fast

316
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
The strategy there being no one else would be stupid enough to invest in this company

317
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
What does you know

318
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Crazy entrepreneurs

319
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Has it been successful yet

320
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,263
So I began to hustle anybody I knew that had money I'd already

321
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
People that

322
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
New people in Madden

323
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
Are the Cowboys playing basketball with

324
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
That one day we finished playing pickup basketball and

325
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
He got into like a BMW and drove off

326
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Same age of Iowa

327
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
What is Jay do

328
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Initial J doesn't do anything

329
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Jason millionaire inherit a bunch of money from his parents

330
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Well I gave you a call the next day

331
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,167
And it just turned out that Jay and had kind of his own food Consciousness Awakening

332
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Started shopping at Safeway love Safeway

333
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
NJ

334
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Said he would put

335
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
$50,000 in

336
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
I was like

337
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Wow okay

338
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Went back to our board said

339
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
I got a guy that I put $50,000 in

340
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
And then shocked

341
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
And

342
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
Several of them decided they wanted to get more money in as well

343
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Sosa what happen

344
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
So we we

345
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Rented

346
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
That burned-out location

347
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
And

348
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
The story there was also kind of interesting because the owner of that building

349
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,055
Was this guy named Ben Powell and it been in his family lives he's an attorney living in Houston

350
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,639
I had to go and sell him on doing the snap

351
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Supermarket

352
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Building

353
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
I pitched him on A10

354
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
He started laughing kind of towards the end of my pet

355
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
I said

356
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Interpal when you laugh

357
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Anysex

358
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
John

359
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,607
I mean it sounds like the museum movie kind of recording movie he said John you are so

360
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Full

361
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
Unenthusiastic on you think you can conquer the

362
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Holy war

363
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
Would like to come teach a different Sun

364
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
But you remind me of myself when I was young

365
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
Let's do your God

366
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Darn

367
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
Natural Food supermarket

368
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
And so we were able to get that store open

369
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
However while we were building it

370
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
I want to

371
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
My friendly competitors

372
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
But it opened up

373
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
After Safeway

374
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,935
Call Clarksville natural grocery and I really love the two entrepreneurs that we're doing that Craig Weller marshmallow

375
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
These are good guys

376
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
They work really hard

377
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
I got a good store

378
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
I pitched them look

379
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,919
Where can I open SnapChat read Supermarket won the first naturally supermarkets anywhere in the world

380
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Aren't you do it with us

381
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,271
What are they join you instead of young

382
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Exact

383
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,415
Coin-op and don't be so much fun by the way if you don't we're only a mile away from your side

384
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Your store you're going to

385
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Now you're going to have trouble competing with us

386
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
What you told them you basically said to them

387
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
Hey this is going to be great let's work together and if you don't were going to crush you

388
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
No I didn't say it that way I'll get cuz

389
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Sun-Times

390
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,567
Funny thing is when I told the story that's how I get some charge Anita course I didn't

391
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Threaten them

392
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
I mean I said

393
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
We're only going to be a mile away we're going to have this big storage going to be it's going to be harder for you to compete why don't we do this together

394
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
Did they have any any of their own conditions

395
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Yes

396
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,231
1 pregnant marks conditions as we have to make this a real store with

397
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
So meet

398
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
We have to sell beer and wine have to sell coffee

399
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
We can't just be

400
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,191
Completely a vegetarian idealistic store we don't want to partner with

401
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
And I'd already thought Craig and Mark store was very successful and I talked to a lot of customers cross shop

402
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
And

403
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
They all wanted

404
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
To loosen our products

405
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Standard

406
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
To make it more like a real grocery store

407
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
It was kind of like we know if we're going to eat these Foods

408
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
Then we need to be able to we should sell them

409
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
So

410
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
That was a

411
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
The compromise that was made to turn out to be the right compromise from a business

412
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
The business

413
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Precision Prospect

414
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Yeah and

415
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,567
So the funny thing was they had trouble making up their minds about it and they come down after they close their store up

416
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Darfur has been constructed

417
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,199
And then literally like two weeks before ostrava set to open

418
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
They have seen enough and they said we're in

419
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623
And so we had to we had to really scramble

420
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
2

421
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
When are we had to try to integrate our

422
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Our team members together

423
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
And

424
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Where to change the name

425
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
And this is assuming this world was

426
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Is going to come in well

427
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
We started with the name Marcus

428
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
We are Market

429
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,055
And then it was like what kind of Market are worth food market

430
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
What kind of

431
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
Food Market are we were kind of a Natural Foods Market

432
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
When I see what kind of generic and cost of Natural Market

433
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
When will Kevin organic

434
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Yeah but we don't have just one

435
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
Organic Whole Foods

436
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
And that was that

437
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Whole Foods Market that start with R

438
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Amazon

439
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Smoking with her name

440
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,799
In the store with media success people sometimes ask how long did it take the first Whole Foods Market to be successful

441
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
And the answer to answer is it took till about 3 in the afternoon on the first day

442
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Wow

443
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Was that just because of

444
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Black or was that just

445
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
Because of they were they was

446
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
Disc Institute glamouring ways an element of luck

447
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
And success in life

448
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
1 reasons I wanted to merge with those guys

449
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Was not only because

450
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
I like them

451
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
And thought they could help us

452
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,471
But I thought you know what if we can get Clarksville and safer way in here will have almost enough

453
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
Sales between the two stores to break even and then if we get other customers

454
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Will

455
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Never look back

456
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
But again

457
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
People were so excited about the

458
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
This first or it was

459
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
It was amazing and we didn't do any advertising we just open the doors

460
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
But nowhere Word of Mouth

461
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Was incredible hole Austin kind of

462
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
Counterculture hippie community

463
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
New about it immediately

464
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
Linda just keep

465
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Keep going like that

466
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
From that point on

467
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
No

468
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Like nine months after we opened

469
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,031
Is it now in May of 1981 Austin had the worst flood that it had in about a hundred years

470
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
And our store was located in the hundred year flood

471
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
So we're actually where we were in the hundred year flood plain but I said what what does that mean it says well about every hundred years you're going to have

472
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,599
What I said okay I'll take touchy

473
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,023
It was a Sunday night there been a lot of rain during the weekend but then it just really starting to rain on Sunday in

474
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
I don't home

475
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
Was at friend's house having dinner in

476
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,983
Renee started to call and said the water is beginning to rise

477
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
What are we doing. I said take the ball

478
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
Beck's pile Em Up

479
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
In front of the doors in inside the store

480
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
Because that's what I thought the water would come in through the doors and actually

481
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
They kept the water out

482
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Till I got up to about 4 feet

483
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,255
But that store was not designed to be a submarine and stuff when the water got up to about 4 feet

484
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
The Punisher weight of the water

485
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,399
Basically broke through the glass of the doors

486
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
I just came in like a tidal wave

487
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
Renee ended up swimming out of the store that night

488
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
And

489
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,431
It was a Sunday and we have three days of sales

490
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,527
There was in our floor safe so I want to get the cash out of the store

491
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
And I went back with no lights going to

492
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Picture it now with

493
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
All the powers out at snide

494
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Place around the back

495
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
The flashlight

496
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
And there are actually

497
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
People wandering around the store looters were wandering around the store

498
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
One of the back I went into the office and they open up the floor safe

499
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Was able to pull the money out

500
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
This was a time when

501
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
We didn't take nobody to credit cards

502
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
More than half our money back then was just in cash

503
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
I mean I think we had about a hundred thousand dollars

504
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
And

505
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
I'd put it all in this grocery pack

506
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
And I was wondering out the store and this guy comes up to me and he says he can find anything good in the back room

507
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
I said I'm not sure

508
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,144
Dark before you go check it out

509
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,752
And we got the money out and put it in a safe place and

510
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:37,152
And then we thought we were pretty much out of business they were cars floating down the street watching

511
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
Float away in just a moment after the flood and

512
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,952

People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees

527
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
But annuities

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

534
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm guy Raz

535
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,928
So it's the spring of 1981 and John Nikes first Whole Food store

536
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Is literally

537
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Underwater

538
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
It's only been open for 6 months

539
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
And they had no flood insurance

540
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Hanging a picture with the store was like

541
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
This

542
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:40,544
Tidal wave of water come in and when you have a flood like that all the sewage lines back up as well

543
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,384
So you have all this bulk food and yeah we have

544
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,248
Meat fish and sewage and it was just a total

545
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
Horrible map

546
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
And

547
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Stop

548
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Anyhow

549
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
We showed up for work

550
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,304
And we started cleaning everything up and all those other people I kind of recognize them but they weren't team members and in

551
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
They were favored customers

552
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,936
Can customers and neighbors and everybody was pitching in school

553
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Why all right hopefully should have died through that flood

554
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
We had to rebuild the store

555
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
It's going to cost a lot of money to do that and

556
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
We just didn't have the money so I thought

557
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
We're on we all thought we were finished

558
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,368
But every one of the stakeholders rally that if there was a benefit help for the store and

559
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
The team members they work for free

560
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
Are bank loans Money

561
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Oh my signature which was worthless

562
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,400
And the investors decided to kick in more cash so we were able to reopen 30 days later

563
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
That just pulled everybody together we really United

564
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Around that

565
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
Near-death

566
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
So did you

567
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Focus at that point on

568
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Just getting things

569
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
In order

570
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
No

571
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
I want to open a second store After the flood

572
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
It was like

573
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,832
We can't put all of our eggs in a basket in my float down the river

574
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
We've got to have a second

575
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Store

576
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
The second store didn't it didn't start as well as a

577
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
The first story was up in North Austin and it was

578
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
In the suburbs come away from the

579
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,376
The counterculture community of Austin and was trying to Market

580
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
It's more conventional

581
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
In a Suburban people in it

582
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
It took a couple years for that store.

583
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Actually turn its first profit

584
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
Give me open the third store on Austin and Southall

585
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
Now that that turned out to be

586
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
I very challenging for us because that store

587
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Too close to our original stormed and cannibalized it

588
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Significant

589
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
And together

590
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
We started to lose money

591
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
Play cousin attention with with

592
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Your partners

593
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Well

594
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
That led to a big debate because one of the

595
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Partners mark

596
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
He really didn't want to grow because

597
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
We had this gold mine he just wanted to mine it

598
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Yeah so

599
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
The long and short of it was that

600
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Mark

601
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Sold his interest

602
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
And the company

603
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,808
And when it's another Direction in his life so he was the first

604
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,184
Co-founder to exit actually Renee xidan slightly before him cuz she and I broke up

605
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
And she wanted

606
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
To travel the world

607
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
The other place

608
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
So she got a new boyfriend

609
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
And she left

610
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,704
And doing a startup business together either

611
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
Brings you closer together or

612
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
Rip your part in the case of Renee and I ended up working out

613
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Depart

614
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
So then it was just Craig and I laughed

615
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
And I think a partnership

616
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
It challenge when it gets into hard times

617
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
The good times are easy

618
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
But did you ever

619
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Did you ever think to yourself

620
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Maybe

621
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Maybe they're right maybe weeks at a time

622
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Too quickly maybe I made a mess

623
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Course I was thinking that

624
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
I mean

625
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,864
I was regretting that opening the South often store because

626
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
I mean almost all the sales

627
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
It got came at the expense of

628
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Original store so

629
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
But

630
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
I really wanted to grow the business

631
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
I mean I am not saying I all the challenges were

632
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
Like oh boy another great challenges

633
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Getting is really hard but I've always saw it is

634
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,600
Okay this is a great lesson for me I can learn something

635
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Here I am learning song

636
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
I learned a lot

637
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
From

638
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,048
Those early failures are those are not really Kelly a store that early

639
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
Trials if you were looking to 2

640
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,728
Expand the business presumably you would have to raise some pretty serious money

641
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Yes

642
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
In 1988 we decided we couldn't

643
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Grow as fast as we wanted to grow from just

644
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
Are retained profits Tapped Out

645
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
All of our friends and family

646
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,576
There was no Angel Network so we needed to raise some venture capital

647
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
This was a time when venture-capital was not

648
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
Really really cranked up like it is today

649
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
We hired a banker

650
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
And we began to try to raise

651
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Venture Capital money and we got rejected

652
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Again and again and again are we

653
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,264
Trying to talk to the venture capitalist and they just couldn't get we were doing I mean

654
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
One guy who turned me down

655
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
He said to me he said you know John

656
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
I see you got a pretty good business here but

657
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
It looks to me like I look at all the stores

658
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,296
You just a bunch of hippies and you're just selling food to other hippies

659
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
I don't think that's a very big Market

660
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
NFL spread

661
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
Further than

662
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,024
Then the big companies are going to take a lot of interest in it

663
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
I don't think you can compete with Safeway

664
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,656
I don't think she compete with these big commercial supermarkets going to run out of business

665
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
People still telling me that today I've been hearing it

666
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
40 years I mean he had a point back then

667
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
About the

668
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,432
Of course I'm sure that guy is kicking himself today

669
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,552
But yeah he Pieology apologize to me about 10 years later that was the worst decision I've ever made

670
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
What Woody's Venture Capital companies based in Texas or did you go to like

671
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,464
Like Silicon Valley like where were you looking for money to go to Silicon Valley

672
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
And we got

673
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
2 based out of Houston

674
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
But

675
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
We were beginning to slowly crossover

676
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Because we

677
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,496
We're not only selling natural organic foods but our quality of food was better

678
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,848
I'm so we were beginning to get a more mainstream Shopper coming in

679
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
And that was beginning to

680
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
To drive some

681
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Address

682
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,760
So we got to investors from Houston and we got another one out of the

683
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
Out of Silicon Valley and then what did that enable

684
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Hispanic

685
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,696
Yes we sold 34% of the business

686
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
4

687
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
An eight and a half million dollar valuation

688
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,376
So about eight times are earnings

689
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Or about

690
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
I don't know what 20%

691
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
15% of our sales

692
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
It was

693
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
It's ridiculous the kind of valuations people get today

694
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
Compared to what we could get back in the

695
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
The late 1980s

696
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
When you start to think about

697
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Going public

698
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Yeah

699
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
But

700
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Venture capitalist the night and wants to go Papa

701
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
They wanted us to do another round of venture Finance

702
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
But

703
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584
I was determined not to do another round of venture financing because

704
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
That would have given them control of the company

705
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,728
And I just didn't trust the Venture God

706
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Venture capitalists are like hitchhikers

707
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Hitchhikers with credit cards

708
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
And as long as you take them to where they want to go

709
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
They will help you pay for the gas

710
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
But

711
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
If you don't take them where they want to go

712
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
They will try to hijack the car

713
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
And they will hire a new driver

714
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Throw you out on the side of the road

715
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
So I did not

716
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,864
Tres veces I liked him I didn't trust him I did not want him to take control.

717
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
I'm going to go public and then we're going to get The Hitchhikers out of the car

718
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
So

719
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,592
With a little early for Whole Foods to go public or so I was told later on

720
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
But we did go public back in 1992

721
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
And we raised about 28 million dollars

722
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
Add overnight your company was worth what

723
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Overnight be worth 100 million

724
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
An insult

725
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,464
What does that mean does that mean that instantly you had

726
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
All of this cash and you could

727
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Actually

728
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
Croat

729
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Wanted to grow

730
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
Yes the greatest thing about

731
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
Thought it was we had a

732
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
A currency

733
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
The currency being around stock

734
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,080
We can now go to other companies are like Whole Foods Market

735
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,664
You're the biggest but there were other we had other peers that you were

736
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
She was looking to buy

737
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
Yes first one was Bread & circus in

738
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
Boss I remember that Spray Company

739
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
And

740
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,952
Next we acquired mrs. Gooch's remember mrs.

741
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
And we did not 93

742
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
We did a big one with fresh peels

743
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
And they had 22 scores Week 1

744
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Fatima 1990s

745
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
Winfield I had those we were able to grow much faster

746
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
So as you're like expansion

747
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Just move.

748
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Through the 90s

749
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
Descendants mm

750
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
Yeah I mean I have to assume that you also

751
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
We're changing how

752
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Supply chains work in NM and how people

753
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Produced food and and

754
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
I guess

755
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Create new markets for Organics

756
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
That's really true we did

757
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
I mean

758
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Wish didn't do it by ourselves obviously but

759
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,728
Because you have Farmers but we created much of the demand

760
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
4 National organic in United

761
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
State R6S

762
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
And

763
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,688
That created more farmers and more entrepreneurs wanting

764
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
To farm organic

765
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Claremore manufacturer

766
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
Mapreduce

767
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Organic

768
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Manufactured

769
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Good so we helped

770
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
We had a huge impact

771
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
We still do

772
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,280
What what percentage of the grocery market

773
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Get this whole foods

774
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
And control today

775
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
I think it's about

776
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
1 + 1/2

777
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
To 2%

778
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,312
We don't control that by the way right yeah

779
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
What about 1 to 2% of all groceries

780
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Which is a lot smaller than I think a lot of pee

781
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
People would assume that

782
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Whole Foods influencer

783
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Probably

784
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Much greater than

785
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
The damn thing

786
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,856
Yeah like I said we're like a boxer punching above our weight class

787
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah meaning

788
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
It's it's it's

789
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Surprising at how many stores are

790
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
We have about 400

791
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
I want to ask you a question about the stores

792
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Because you of course have heard the joke

793
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
The whole food

794
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Is Mike Holt

795
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
Check writing that the prices are so expensive

796
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
For most people so, do you think that's a fair criticism

797
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Well

798
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
Of course we don't like that

799
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
And it's not I will not

800
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,296
Nickname was given to us it was first giving to us affectionately

801
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
But people who loved us

802
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
And then it became a

803
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Clubman

804
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,440
People would be tan Whole Foods you didn't like us

805
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
And there's a kind of a tendency I think

806
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
For people to think

807
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,144
You can get the same quality stuff at lower prices

808
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
I don't think

809
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,240
People have the same quality Whole Foods has

810
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
I think we have the best quality

811
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
So

812
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
It's about a

813
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
Trade off that there's

814
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,664
You just between quality and price

815
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
You have people who

816
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
Who attacked you as well cuz you

817
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
And you've been kind of a lightning rod

818
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
With some of the things that you've

819
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
You said and written about

820
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Climate change

821
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Interviews of August

822
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,024
People that don't seem to jive with Whole Food

823
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,424
Well my take is a course that people that know me like me people that don't know me and

824
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,496
And I just read things or hear things they project

825
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
But

826
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Yeah I've learned

827
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
I've learned a lot

828
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
I've learned that they're like

829
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Four topics

830
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,480
I just don't talk about in public anymore what are they

831
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
I don't talk about politics

832
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,112
Religion sex or GMOs

833
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
What what what is there left to talk about

834
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean

835
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:46,400
I don't even care if people hated me it's just that then they trying to attack Whole Foods yeah baby stop picking on my kid

836
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
Do whatever you want with me but leave the kids out of it

837
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
John when somebody like

838
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Anyone listen to this

839
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
She's going to call for traffic when I walk into a whole food

840
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
There's a feeling that you get

841
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
The company

842
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,992
Has certain values that I think a lot of the show

843
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Identify with

844
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Right there as you know

845
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
There's

846
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
They're sort of an entity

847
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
An attempt to

848
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
To help make the

849
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
Replace into

850
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
Community organizations and it's

851
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
It's it feels very

852
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
I mean lack of a better word I feel so

853
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
Tattoo till our people and so

854
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
You can understand why people

855
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
Are interested in the people

856
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Behind Whole Foods

857
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
You guys are interested in how you say

858
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Yes

859
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
And

860
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,296
I don't know I don't equate liberal with caring

861
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,624
So I don't like going to get in a political argument with you but

862
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:44,256
There's a meta-narrative about business in our world narrative is that business sucks

863
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,096
And businesses is greedy and selfish and exploitative

864
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
It only cares about money

865
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
But

866
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
People don't want to believe Whole Foods Markets

867
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,592
A different kind of company we are we're purpose-driven were stakeholder focused

868
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
If I'm proud of anything

869
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
It's that Whole Foods Market has mated if

870
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
And are we do care

871
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
You know I'm wondering whether

872
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Some of the critics

873
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Shazam that you've had over the

874
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
See no evil away Whole Foods

875
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Does busy

876
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,768
Has been improved whole foods that have there been times where people have said

877
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
But you know what your health is doing with this is wrong and

878
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
For protesting

879
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
Change the way you guys have actually operated

880
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,776
Yeah has I mean the most famous example is backing

881
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
In two thousand and

882
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
3

883
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
We are being picketed by

884
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Animal Rights Act

885
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
That

886
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
We're very unhappy about this

887
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Particular duck we were selling

888
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
Which they consider to be a factory farm.

889
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
What I got

890
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
Your dialogue with one of the actor

891
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
Abra passionate so young

892
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
A woman named Lauren arnelious

893
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,304
And I know after about a month or so

894
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
She sends me an email and she says

895
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,192
You know Mr Mackey icy after our dialogue

896
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
You are very ideal

897
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
However

898
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
When it comes to

899
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,408
Livestock animals honestly you don't know what you're talkin about you are not well informed on the subject

900
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
And

901
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
You know I thought about it but you know she's really right I don't know.

902
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
What about this person lamp

903
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
I decided to become an actor

904
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
For myself and that summer summer 2003 read about a dozen book

905
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
How we raise animals in America

906
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
And I was

907
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Utterly horrified

908
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
I guess I just been living in denial it was complete wake up

909
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
And

910
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
By the end of the summer

911
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,800
I made two resolutions one I was going to go

912
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Become a vegan

913
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,944
The number to I Knew Whole Foods needed to do a much better job that the accusations that the animal rights

914
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
People in need about

915
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
What we were doing were fundamentally

916
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Correct we

917
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,624
Then began the process of bringing in animal activist

918
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,928
And Whole Foods people and dialogue

919
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
And that

920
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,840
That led to the global animal partnership which Whole Foods Market sponsored and

921
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
I tried to follow the gaap standards for the last several years

922
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,616
Whole Foods obviously had this explosive growth

923
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Andrea Lee

924
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
Became the biggest

925
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Market

926
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Country but

927
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
As was predicted

928
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,880
The big guys got into this game I mean Walmart is a bigger organic

929
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
Go grocer now and

930
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
There's Trader Joe's and there's competitors and does that

931
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Does that keep you up at night

932
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
No I mean

933
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
It's just new challenges

934
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
This is the great thing about business

935
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
I mean I just can't emphasize creating a business it

936
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,080
There is no point in business where you can say I'd last I have arrived

937
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Yeah

938
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
What makes business so amazing and I can capitalism so Dynamic is that

939
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Fat people

940
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
If you're successful

941
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
When people copy you

942
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
And that's what happened.

943
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
People copy.

944
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,928
That helps keep your edges and helps keep you

945
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
On your toes

946
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,792
Complacency is a very very bad thing to have in business

947
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,912
The two things that hold bring a lot of business to down once complacency and you get successful when you start

948
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Sit on your laurels the other ones hubris

949
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Arrogance

950
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
That you're just better than every

951
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
That's a huge mistake those are both big mess

952
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
I'm trying you still alive

953
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,760
Of course live in Austin so I'm assuming that now and again you must pass by the location of it

954
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Saferway

955
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Stored

956
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,928
Do you ever go out of my way to pass by a n d what is it what is it today

957
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
It's a school

958
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,608
It's a school in front one of my friends started that school like a belly School

959
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
And

960
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
I got a tour of it a few years ago

961
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,776
Anything that was so autocrat they change some of it

962
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Boracay remembered it

963
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,408
Just like it was yesterday and I could see where the

964
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Are we on our block been so I can

965
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
See

966
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Cuz they left

967
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
The basic structure of an impact

968
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,856
So it was it was a trip down memory Road for sure

969
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
I need you you will not

970
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
Run Whole Foods right

971
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,328
Youku Vaughn retire whatever I mean

972
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,656
Candle Company can Whole Foods continue without

973
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Charisma without your charisma without

974
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Your vision

975
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
You are running

976
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Of course

977
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
A can

978
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
And but I mean I do think when the

979
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
When the founder

980
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,856
I'm the last founder left and Craig was the second-to-last I think he left almost 20 years ago

981
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,928
And lot of the people that built the business with

982
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,560
Besides the founders their retiring now cuz in their sixties and they made a lot of money to over the years through Whole Foods

983
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:39,936
So they'll be no one ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as as I love it

984
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Yeah but

985
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,800
Building a business with a little bit like having children and watching the children grow up is that you

986
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
You hope your

987
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,616
Child is healthy and I hope

988
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,456
Burt Reynolds happy inoki child has integrity and does the right thing and

989
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
I think it's important to have a a good

990
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Founder and entrepreneur

991
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
The great businesses

992
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Continue to live on after

993
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
The founder movie

994
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
Whole Foods is in that in that space

995
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,584
John Mackey founder of Whole Foods

996
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,144
From that one tiny store to

997
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Today

998
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,240

999
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
Billion dollars

1000
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,104
And despite selling lots of meat and dairy products

1001
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
John is a committed vegan

1002
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,480
Add a pretty good home cut he's been known to serve his dinner guests

1003
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
Tofu with mushrooms tahini and broccoli

1004
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
For dessert

1005
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

1023
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,703
It's time now for how you built that and the story is from Kyle Ewing

1024
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,543
In Denver Colorado who got his idea for a business

1025
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Kind of a roundabout way

1026
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
I got the idea when I was trying to create a product for students traveling abroad this product was

1027
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
A backup copy of their passport Kyle was trying to sell backup passports online that

1028
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:40,255
Would be as durable as the real thing but also tear proof and waterproof

1029
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,607
Problem was the market for this type of product doesn't yet exist

1030
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
So I was trying to create the market which proved to be very difficult and I was trying to figure out what to do when

1031
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
When the phone rang and the guy the phone

1032
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,967
It was actually somebody who said hey Kyle I love your passport I even bought four of them for my kids

1033
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
Set all four of my daughter's use the SOS world pass I love it but I have a question for you can I buy a

1034
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
A case of your paper and at that moment

1035
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,279
Kyle realize that the waterproof paper he was using for the passports

1036
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
Was actually a better business idea is just the passports that moment was me standing up

1037
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Out of my chair

1038
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
And spiking the pencil

1039
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,311
And doing a touchdown dance because it was an immediate

1040
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,919
Lightbulb moment where I realized this failing business

1041
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,271
Just Brew legs and all of a sudden I had a million and one ideas of what I could use

1042
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,879
Waterproof paper for and the fat is a pretty long list waterproof

1043
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Restaurant menus

1044
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,535
Waterproof children's books waterproof Maps field manuals for the US Navy nautical charts

1045
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
For the u.s. Snapchat back up just a little

1046
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:54,751
Kyle is not an engineer but he was working on the passport idea he made a bunch of calls to Chemical X

1047
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
He told them he was looking to make a paper that was totally waterproof much more waterproof than say

1048
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,039
Laminating something so iteration after iteration we finally got to paper that's

1049
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Both

1050
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
Waterproof and rip proof and something that can also receive and hold ink when it's been pretty

1051
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
Eventually found a manufacturer in the US to make a polyester pulp that could be pressed and roll

1052
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
Into waterproof

1053
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Paper

1054
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
Do you want to Tinker with a product himself so he moved a laser printer into his living room but

1055
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
When I put it through my home laser printer

1056
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:38,271
Immediately white smoke came out of the printer and it smelled like burning plastic and

1057
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:44,671
The entire printer was trashed after the hepatitis very supportive wife Ashley came home that night

1058
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
Smell the burning smell and she said Kyle I love this arts and crafts project you've taken on but I think it's time

1059
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,655
Time to get you a more realistic product or business idea

1060
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:01,055
But one printer and seven iterations later and Kyle says he came up with the most waterproof

1061
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Paper on the market and he has the clients to prove it including guess the US Navy and airforce

1062
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,063
Several restaurant and hotel chains University Labs even Google

1063
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
The good old days when you sit back you look at your sales or you look at the new client you just got in youth

1064
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
Sing oh my gosh this is a real business

1065
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
I'm building something that matters

1066
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
And it actually is a success

1067
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
