00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
How I built this

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,344
A show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
Stories behind the movements

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
They built the story of how

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
Richard Branson took a record shop

22
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
And built it into an airline a bank

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
Space tourism a cola

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
And more than 200 other businesses

00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
All under the name virgin

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
What a lot of people think of the word mogul

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,528
I suspect many of them would put Richard Branson at or near the top of

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
His company virgin

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624

Trains playing spaceships

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
But the thing about Richard Branson

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Is that

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
He's also failed

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
Feel pretty badly

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
Add a lot of the businesses he started

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,056
Today on the show a lot about those failures Richard Branson as a teenager

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
A high school dropout

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Decided

41
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Start a magazine

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Well I started when I was 15

00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
50s

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
And

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
And those dates why don't you know

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
And

47
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
I didn't know what I what I want

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Do was

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,768
Scots magazine the campaign against the Vietnamese War

50
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304

That boys pee on people

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Let's go

53
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,472
How to run the magazine you launched this magazine school student magazine

00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032

00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
Typesetting magazine and publish it and like

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
How did you know to do that

57
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
The best way of

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Running a business

59
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
Throw yourself in the deep end and learn

60
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
Nice things and ask lots of questions and listen listen listen

61
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
And that's what I did when I was

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Young enthusiastic

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
People with very willing to help

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
I managed to track

65
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
A lot of people who believed in the idea

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Inmate in the quest

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
And I

68
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
But a quick learner

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,336
What was Maisie like what kind of charcoal to the run-in you know he would buy it

70
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
I had a circulation which is quite thickening and it over a hundred thousand copies of this year it was

71
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
The glossy magazines

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
YouTube people didn't

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
Think that it was just a magazine for students

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
We got all the best cartoonist

75
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
What Frets we got

76
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Yes I'm the best

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Octopus in the wild

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
You know we had

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Celebrities like Vanessa Redgrave and

80
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Jean-Paul Sartre

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
John le carre write

82
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
16 or 17 years old

83
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
I suspect

84
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Fitbit

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,224
I didn't know tavius though it digest somebody would say no

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
Wouldn't have been able to understand

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,648
And I remember James Bolden was visiting London and I found out which hotel he was in

88
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,792
I turned up at the hotel and those days the tape recorders with 3-foot by 3-foot so I was lugging this

89
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Master tape recorder

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
The real tapes

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
And

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,496
Somehow I think he took pity on me if you don't think it helped me to 16in

93
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,616
And yelling and entice me in and then and I have one of the best interviews of my life

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Uranus magazine

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
You are

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Dyslexic

97
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Like you are just like

98
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
So you already had like

99
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Some trouble with

100
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Making a word

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
How did you

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Did you do that

103
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
I interviewed

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
Eloquent people

105
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Side

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,071
I would make a point of that energy into being people who he spoke well Psych

107
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
Transcribe the words with the word annoy

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Editor of the magazine I said

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm not the kind of magazine this game to embellish what people

110
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,895
Wrightwood is going to give you a question

111
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
And was it

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Was it making money

113
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Profitable where you like

114
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
It was the Bible based

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
We've had enough

116
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
But I seem to pay for the

117
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Cuz we didn't have any

118
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Financial backing a tool

119
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Bring up Coke and tell him to Pepsi with advertising and then maybe get Coke and then ring up Pepsi

120
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,031
We did everything we could just get enough advertising to get the magazine out

121
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
The magazine

122
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Became the vehicle

123
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Cool brother things

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
I've been through the magazine I ended up setting up an advisory sent to the young people

125
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Yunnan people

126
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
Contact the magazine with all sorts of problems that loneliness

127
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Suicidal psychiatric

128
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Venereal disease

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
Pregnancy issues and so on

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
So we set up a sensor that was a gay free help and advice

131
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Young people

132
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Anna Monday

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Largest funeral

134
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Like that saying

135
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Veteran records 10 to 6

136
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Send up any album on any label

137
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
And I'm going to pick response

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
Nobody that was sold music

139
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Get a cheaper price than the

140
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
No more retail

141
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Price

142
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
And it was a starseed legend

143
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
First record

144
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Yeah

145
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,975
Could you please add something we will sell you records

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,839
A discount rate the how did you get the how to get the records how are you actually able to buy them

147
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,727
A good question record companies wouldn't supplies the records cuz we didn't have a credit so

148
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
We get to meet with advertise we get people's money and then we go to local Wrecker

149
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Toboggan

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
Let me know we can give you $3,000 now

151
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
And then

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
In the end

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,159
It became so successful that we had a tick legit Lori's coming up behind this tiny but the record shelf nothing okay

154
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
How many wood

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,071
Taking them off the Lori through the shopping in a tree the shopping to have vehicles the other side in

156
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,911
And in the end the record industry decided that baby to deal with this directly

157
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Stop the charade

158
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Tips of Virgin Records began as one

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
1 records

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,039
Yes I'm only open to record shout when the when the post office went on strike for 2 months

161
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Email order

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Company developed in Peril set

163
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,511
And we went to Bobby's Shoe Shop in Oxford Streisand found an empty space and

164
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,631
Through some records and pillows on the floor and headphones and then

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
We had a

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Acute

167
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
About half a mile long

168
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,799
People getting through the shoe shop out of the winding stairs

169
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
It became the very hip

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Singing

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
In the 70s with people to do

172
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,527
And then I guess this was around the time when you stumbled across a cannabis Shady scheme

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Well it was I stumbled across it by mistake

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
We had an order of records from Belgium which we never had before

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
I'm done 3 filled up a banner week we drove

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,375
Belgian that on the way they're going through France they said have you go to Connie

177
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
We had no idea what the colony was

178
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
1990's old

179
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
They said that's a piece of paper to prove that you're going to leave them

180
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
What why you say you're going to leave

181
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,943
And so they sent us back to England but we still at the records in the boot of a car

182
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
You don't we

183
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Go to 55% reduction cuz they

184
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,439
English Taxman thought that we'd exported them

185
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Your records of the lower price

186
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Yeah so if you Expo track what you done

187
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
You don't have to pay

188
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,399
Confetti Pops in tax so hopefully we wish you could sell them in England

189
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Anyway I got chords

190
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
And the number of the record show

191
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
Don't sit in the same thing

192
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Talk about hands

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
And

194
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
Amanda told me like that

195
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Sleeping by the time

196
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
So how did you go from

197
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Criminal record store

198
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Shop to

199
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Turning into

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
A label

201
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
Well one day somebody paid me a tape

202
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
I loved

203
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
We didn't have a record company side

204
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
P27 recommence nobody would put it out

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Attendance

206
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Gothic script let's do it let's let's

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Start her own record company record this album

208
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Let's see if we can

209
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Get some traction with it and then

210
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
The album it was a 15 year old

211
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Glad over all these beautiful

212
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
Instruments and no words to toes that's why record company store

213
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Upholstery South

214
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
This Record was

215
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,975
I was mike oldfields tubular bells with show like

216
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Million copies

217
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
It's how many exact copies

218
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Wilson managed to get

219
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
But you didn't see the Exorcist which was

220
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Completely the opposite

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
I think the style of transacted a Exorcist

222
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Of course yeah right

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
That helped

224
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
Break it into number one in America as well

225
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,783
Yeah but it wasn't in the media

226
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
You like Mike

227
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Very shy retiring person

228
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
He wouldn't do interviews

229
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
Which is not easy way

230
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
And on the way to

231
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
The fest concert that

232
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
He constantly degree to do what I would pull together

233
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,447
Stevie Winwood and traffic is tied up and Rolling Stones the lullaby the Great

234
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Autistic play with him

235
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,591
On the way there you just deduct Richard like, go through with it I can't go on stage and face people

236
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
And I was driving

237
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
An old beaten up car that I've been given for my wedding

238
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
I'm done

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
So I pulled in and setup mic

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,367
I know you can't psychologically make it but 10

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
If I was to give you the keys to this card you think you could overcome your psychological fears

242
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
I'm done

243
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
People is for a second set.

244
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
I think I might be able to hear after oral sex

245
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,007
I lost the car but that concept was very instrumental in

246
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,127
Is Success you would like

247
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
2223 the time I guess

248
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
You can drop out of high school

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
How did you

250
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
How to get the confidence to

251
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Deflect

252
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Do this to start a record label

253
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
You didn't know anything about record label

254
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
That you were young and you figured

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
What the hell

256
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
If you can run one business you can run

257
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Any business in a people

258
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,287
Say how can somebody from the record this is going to be alive is so old and so on

259
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
A business

260
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Is an idea

261
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
That's going to make other people's lives

262
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
That's what business is I know you got such an idea

263
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Then

264
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
Find people who can help you turn that idea into reality

265
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
Find people who got experience in that say

266
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,255
Find people who don't have experience in that site to can coming

267
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
You bring fresh ideas and check out the particular sectarian

268
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Have a lot of fun with it

269
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
That's been my

270
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Philosophy

271
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
I mean that

272
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
That hasn't

273
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
Work out for you every time right because even with

274
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Things like

275
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Virgin Airlines

276
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
It wasn't just

277
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Easy lunch

278
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Start

279
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Yeah

280
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
What actually happened was

281
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
I'm driving sent it to 747 and

282
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
We didn't get the insurance

283
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Until

284
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
We've got power airplane

285
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Certificate

286
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
On

287
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
Very very very first test flight

288
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
I fucken packed right into one of the engines

289
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Which meant that

290
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,215
It's going to cost about $700,000 to fix overnight

291
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
If that $700,000

292
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Supposed to say bra limit

293
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
The bank that

294
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Yeah gave us our overdraft facility

295
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Basic Atlantic

296
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Yeah

297
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Can a guy come back and find it back on just sitting on my doorstep

298
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
Stupid I invited him into the house soon

299
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
And he tells me that

300
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,047
I'm becoming slightly over overdraft facility in the scanner

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Close the hole that can group down on the Monday

302
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
IO

303
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
I done told me get angry but I just literally got stood up and

304
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
Pushed him out at my house and told me wasn't ever welcome very kind which is not

305
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Maybe the best thing to do to your bank manager

306
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Stokes what happened

307
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Over the weekend we

308
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Ryan

309
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
Libraries record companies around the world and we

310
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Scrape together the money in

311
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
By Monday

312
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Weed

313
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Ethika

314
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Facility down and then

315
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,631
Instantly by the Friday we found another bank that

316
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Instead of giving us

317
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
Tremont and avocado facility would give us a testament in time that we drop the city based on

318
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
The same set of figures

319
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
You know sometimes I think people get to wedded to

320
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Is that the doctor they know or the

321
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,759
Accountants in Ohio the bank they know and it's important to be willing to

322
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Test the water with

323
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Are you not with the competition

324
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
As much as possible I think yeah

325
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
So you had two

326
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
I mean to keep the airline going you had to

327
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Make a decision about the record

328
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Yeah

329
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
British Airways quite quickly

330
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Don't stay what

331
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Became famous he knows the Dixie Chicks

332
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Campaign

333
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
So we we had about four planes flying and they went to extraordinary lengths

334
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Stupid is that a business they had a team of people illegally accessing a computer information and ringing up

335
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
I'll passengers and pretending that they were from Virgin telling them that flights are cancelled and switch to the month

336
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
NBA they had people going through my rubbish binson

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,095
I'm trying to find incriminating stuff that people get a gamecock club sand

338
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,239
Go for the rubbish bins outside of clubs and looking for needles so they could these stories to these scurrilous press about

339
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
Drugs in the clubs and so on

340
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
We won the biggest

341
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
Damages in UK history and it was Christmas time baby

342
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,415
We have two brother hope to be able to do this again every Christmas but anyway

343
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
We realized then that we needed the Top Pot to deal with ba

344
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
And it would have to keep

345
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,655
Mula jumps protected at Virgin Records and Airline

346
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
I need to sell something and soap

347
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,031
Very sadly we sold Virgin Records

348
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
We got a billion dollars for it

349
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
So it would make sure that

350
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
WeChat vaonis

351
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,039
But I hate sending things cuz basically accompanies a group of people and it was a

352
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Very mixed feelings

353
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
I heard that you cried when you

354
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Because I ended up choking tossed off and then

355
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
Running back to my house download brookgrove and I

356
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,911
Literally identity is streaming down my face and then I ran passed a sign that said

357
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
Branson sells for a billion

358
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
And I thought I hope

359
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
No photography

360
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,663
Catch me decide which is streaming down my face look very very strange

361
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Is that a hard decision to make.

362
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
The full things are do you feel like

363
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,927
It's a necessary decision in order to protect everything else you have on occasions you know we can have

364
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
80000 people duet version

365
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,911
The FED livelihood that jobs had children everything depends on that I didn't say sometimes you have to make

366
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Decisions along the way

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
So just out of curiosity would you if you had to fly on British Airways today what you doing

368
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Yes I'm in

369
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
United Check In

370
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Maybe put up

371
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967

It's a Wonderful Life

434
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Sebastian

435
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
It wasn't Coke and it wasn't Pepsi it happened to be

436
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
This other one in the same test

437
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Little kids school

438
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
And the same thing turned out overwhelmingly the

439
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Love the One

440
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Pepsi

441
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
So we decided to

442
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Because based on that test

443
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
Kids school

444
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
So

445
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,767

00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,775
Yeah man hit somebody taking on the biggest company in the world which in a foolish

449
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,871
We had some big smiles and some days thinking

450
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
Yeah cuz the best-known brand in the world

451
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,295
I'm done in a very good topic I we thought it would be

452
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Anyway

453
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Besides loans in America

454
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
And then we got a Sherman tank

455
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
Arrived in Times Square as you do in the meantime

456
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
We trust all these Coke cans

457
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Stand

458
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375

Ben X go without anybody knowing about it and then turn the tanks on it

00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
Because it went up in flames

462
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
You look like a tit

463
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Anyway

464
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,087
We would not have votes in America and what was going on at Coke

465
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Was

466
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
They went to any country

467
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,463
That we we're doing well and they started in the year

468
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
UK

Anderson Kelly just disappeared from all the shells do they do they just went to retailers and Blake had a baby

00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,935
Went to retailers they gave them off as they couldn't

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215

Tescos

473
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
It had

474
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
You're like shells and shells by Dakota South May

475
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
It wasn't a very systematic knee-capping job did you see it happen right before your eyes

476
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Free watching this

477
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Happen

478
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
I was I didn't know what was going on

479
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Except that I knew that

480
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
Retailers with something

481
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Delisting a

482
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
And it was a couple years later.

483
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
My new bank

484
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Lloyds Bank

485
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Took me out

486
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Dinner and

487
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
She

488
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
I just joined Lloyd's

489
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
And have previous job at being a

490
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,335
Coke and she probably told me how she decided to drive is that

491
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,711
It's like The Godfather or Goodfellas all the sudden someone like something just disappear

492
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
I exactly now I'm in it is that Stephanie a business

493
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Fashions of the garden

494
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Are there BPA plated on this

495
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
But fortunately

496
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,743
We work much better quality airlines that we survived in that case

497
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
And then

498
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
When coach ride is on this I mean the problem was the

499
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
You know we didn't have

500
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,239
Something completely unique you know we we had a great brand

501
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Coco Grapevine

502
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
I need the taste of

503
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
Color with maybe mods in the back of it

504
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
Since then what I learned from that was

505
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Only to go into businesses where

506
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
We were palpably better than overcoming

507
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
At what point did you decide

508
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
This isn't going to work

509
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Just stop doing

510
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
When I realize that we are the number one coder in Bangladesh and nowhere else I think I'm finally just has to cook it today

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Trade show folding virgin Cola was not a

512
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Is agonizing

513
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Selling

514
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
It wasn't because

515
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Soft drink unhealthy

516
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Chicory

517
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Hunting soda ready to

518
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
You didn't have to say men

519
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Got no reply then

520
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
I'd already moved on to new Ventures new new challenges

521
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
I mean I'm somebody that

522
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
You know I'll fight tooth-and-nail to

523
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Make something

524
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
16th Amendment

00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Exceed

526
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
The next day

527
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
I would have forgotten about

528
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
Move on to the next Venturian

529
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Yeah but I mean

530
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Sting a little bit

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Yeah look at it

532
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
If something's not working I mean

533
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Is the Vantage the virgin

534
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Hot

535
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Relatively quickly

536
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
What's that we had cash to try things out

537
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
What's important when you do have cash is that you to try things that they're loaded

538
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,512
A company's when they get cash they want to conserve that cash the frightened of

539
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Taking any risks with it

540
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
But

541
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,424
You know you cannot ready be a true entrepreneur if you don't have failures along the way

542
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
But you're not pushing

543
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
But you're not pushing the limits

544
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
If every single thing you do turns to gold

545
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
Soapstone ask about another

546
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
This was just an idea to sell Bridal Wear

547
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
Right as it was launched at the end in 96 what was the Genesis of that

548
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
I love the name

549
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Open

550
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Of course was that

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
The wind today

552
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
I'm done so we had no clients

553
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
But why would you want to go into

554
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Kelly Bridal where did you look at inside

555
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
A narrative be tapped

556
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
It disrupted and

557
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
And said that you wanted

558
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808

1971 and for period of time he was a millionaire

Thanks for sticking around because we are now at the very end of the show which means

749
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,872
It's time to hear about the things

750
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Your building

751
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:47,296
This week we've got a story coming out of Southern California my name is Allison Hans and I started

752
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
A company called living zesty and living zesty does

753
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
Before she launched the company Allison Spence

754
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Two decades

755
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
Raising her kids which is a full-time job

756
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,448
You know when you're in your busy and your mom you're driving everybody everywhere

757
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
And then all of a sudden your youngest

758
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,824
Gets her driver's license and when that happened

759
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
It meant that all of a sudden

760
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
Allison had some extra time on her hands

761
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
And

762
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,504
I'm kind of Serial entrepreneur

763
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
And I'm always thinking on what can I do what can I sell

764
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,904
The idea of what to sell didn't come to Allison right away

765
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
One day last spring she was visiting her sister-in-law

766
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
And she thought workers

767
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Pulling up the grass

768
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
From the front lawn

769
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
And replacing it with artificial turf

770
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
Will do so just unroll it's like carpet

771
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
They'll just cut around where you going to leave

772
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,616
Flower bed is ending so they can't really use this

773
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Kind of odd shape so they take it back with them and throw it out because there's been a drought in Southern California

774
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
A lot of homeowners are doing this with their lungs are just taking out the lawn and replacing it with artificial turf which means they're

775
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
There is a lot of artificial grass

776
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Leftover night thinking

777
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
You know what we can make use of this

778
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
One more time

779
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
So one day last spring

780
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,984
Allison grab some of the leftover scraps from her sisters front lawn

781
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
She went to a garage

782
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Box cutter

783
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
And she carved out a circular doormat

784
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Native artificial grass

785
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
Is surprisingly soft

786
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,552
And I only like real grass like this clean

787
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
Antigen going to landfill so like

788
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
Green and clean right that looks so cool that Allison posted a picture on Facebook and she said paid

789
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
I just did it

790
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
Went for coffee Forest leader come home

791
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
And there's like 11 people like I want one and no I'm not texting anymore.

792
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,152
I might be onto something here to Allison started to collect more scraps of artificial turf effect

793
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
Installers were so happy to get rid of it they gave it to her for free

794
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
She got her son to design a logo

795
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
And tomato run website are pretty shoestring 199 GoDaddy

Svet

798
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
How I did it so there's not huge

799
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
Since Allison launched a website a few months ago

800
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
She sold about 50 of the match but she says

801
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,288
She hopes this is the beginning of something much much bigger I liken it to

802
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,848
Growing out charm you know when you're fishing

803
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:24,224
A lot of my day sometimes is throwing up that Chum into the ocean to attract the fish

804
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
