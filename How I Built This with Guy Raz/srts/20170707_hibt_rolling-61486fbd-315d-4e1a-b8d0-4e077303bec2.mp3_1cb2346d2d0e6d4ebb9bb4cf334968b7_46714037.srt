50 years of great journalism reputation for integrity

Volume stuff and then there was a couple of really bad judgment calls were made on a very sensitive story

The people who get on the show is

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
They all saw an opportunity and they took it

20
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
Sure there was locked

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,552
Hard work failure persistence all that

22
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,160
What's the difference between say Sara Blakely and the rest of us

00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208

At the right time

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,480
1960s student journalists at UC Berkeley

31
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Right at the time when San Francisco in the Bay Area we're becoming the center of youth culture in America

32
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Just being there wasn't enough

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
What you did was to capture the moment it take that energy and create a Gathering Place

34
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
People magazine

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
Spoke to them in their language

36
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Is this small small town

37
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Yet at the same time as that

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,504
Beautiful picturesque town which was very tolerant of

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,368
Social behavior center and the Arts community

40
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
There was a beatnik

41
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Allen ginsberg and Kerouac

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Controlling netty and me

43
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
All found a home in San Francisco

44
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
People like

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Lenny Bruce

46
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
So

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
It had a thriving

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Beatnik

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,688
Alternative lifestyle community and so they were there for was extremely tolerant

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Other Rock & Roll groups are springing up

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Even weirder

52
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Then the beat

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
And a hat Coffee House scene in

54
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Consistent

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
San Francisco's Longstreet

56
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Of being tolerant of different kinds

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
The political movements aren't just

58
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Because of course I'm pretty strong

59
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
50 movements at Columbia and nn

60
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Boston butt

61
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
San Francisco Berkeley

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
That was the center of

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
Student activism in America are arguably in the world

64
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,248
I think so yeah I mean that Colombia came several years after that was 96

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
C8

66
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
So I think it really started in the San Francisco Bay Area it wasn't coming by

67
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
At the very early days of civil rights

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
So a lot of students were going off on March 8th

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Down south

70
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Participating

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Think so

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
I think look like as a man

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Among students

74
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Really was generated in the Bay Area

75
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
What was it exciting exciting

76
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
Oh yeah I mean cuz you look men

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
The possibility in

78
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
These post-war baby boom just trying to come of age soon become

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Call students incensing

80
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,624
That that was their turn on stage and it lives there right or responsibility to

81
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Try and make America stand up for me

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
And behave in such a way

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
At work we were taught

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047

00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
After that job ran out about nine months later

143

00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
An

159
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
I guess

160
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
Seether here I said

161
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Why don't we start a publication about

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167

00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
And was going to be

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
Focused on rock and roll

167
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503

169
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
So help me understand this

170
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
This guy

171
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Ralph Gleason in notable

172
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
Well respected Jazz critic for the San Francisco Chronicle

173
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Young man but middle-aged

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Has enough confidence in a 21 year old kid to say yeah rock and roll Magazine with you

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
Has sound implausible now doesn't it

176
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
I don't

177
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
No I mean

178
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455
We got along really well and then we share the same vision

179
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
And he had when he was young

180
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Start a publication called Jazz quarterly

181
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Which was

182
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Good summer to stay with fans

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439

Belle Chasse

185
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
So I think

186
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
Probably saw in me I may be a younger version of himself

187
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
He saw the possibilities he saw

188
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,447
That I had some kind of level of talent ambition that might be able to bring some

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Something off he even gave me money for

190
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,127
What was the ambition did you guys sit there and say we are going to make the biggest magazine in America

191
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
No

192
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
I mean I don't even know if you knew what the biggest maggot

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,575
America was but that wasn't for us to do something

194
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
That was new and fresh and about music and

195
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
What drug was no longer you know dance time is started having some very serious music on political content

196
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Associate

197
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Nissan

198
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
People assigned to articulate a member of velious stance towards Society they were

199
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Concerned about me like Bill Monroe

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
Alienation and

201
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
The Beatles were writing

202
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Lot about Tramp

203
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
Social mores in how people should be treated and

204
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
These four things are beginning to wrestling

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Equally with a new Young

206
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Generation of which I was on the Leading Edge up to Ralph says okay let's

207
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,375
Let's do this he has a little bit of cash to put in

208
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
He had some cash to put in and I got some $2,000 to my mother or my mother

209
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
Mother-in-law to be and some money from a college friend of mine and and also for my stepmother

210
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Assembled together was

211
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,575
$7,500 and that was what we started

212
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
And what did you do for that pointed you assemble a staff did you start to write articles that you have to find a place that was going to

213
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Starting something today you could just put it online

214
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
But then I'm finding a

215
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Printer

216
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Expensive

217
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Expensive proposition

218
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Distribution

219
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
Yeah I was all, but you're not too expensive but we need to find a office

220
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
This is how we

221
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Went to the

222
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Printer that we had used it

223
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Sonny ramparts agreed to

224
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
Give us offices upstairs in airplane

225
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Facility since we're going to print the magazine there

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
We assembled friends of mine and people I met at ramparts

227
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Berkeley

228
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
Or other people running about the rock on scene last of all the volunteer

229
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Diapers to write articles

230
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Pictures of help put it together so

231
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
It was really a volunteer effort

232
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
How did you come up with a name

233
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
A lot of games

234
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
The one that kept sticking was rolling stone

235
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
Bob dylan song Like a Rolling Stone

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
Anna was a title of an essay that Ralph is written

237
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
For a small publication called The American Scholar

238
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
In which he laid out his

239
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Is thinking about

240
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
The meaning of rock and roll lesson

241
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
New America belting Americans

242
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Society

243
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
Just walk me through this in 96

244
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
She 7 I mean because today of course the lawyers

245
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,287
LLC in the documents of Incorporation

246
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
Did you have to do any of that or was it just

247
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Fly by the seat of your pants

248
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,735
Does fly by the seat of my pants I mean nothing by magazine publishing and distribution

249
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
Out of vague understand what editorial was and it what should be like

250
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
You had a right

251
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
Port Royal Pets mixed drinks with the record companies

252
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
And it was just right up

253
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Assembly print

254
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
But I mean you were creating a business did you how did you even know

255
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Where to start

256
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
I had no clue

257
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
None

258
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
You know it was just

259
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
We pay what we can pay for the money we had on hand

260
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
That would be as far as he going since we're paying salaries weren't paying rent

261
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
I only costly was

262
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Printer paper

263
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Randolph

264
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,255
Now the cost of distributions which I wasn't even aware of

265
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
Until two or three months later when all these Trucking bills

266
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Yeah

267
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
Soup from the time that you raise that $7,500

268
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
The time the first issue came out what was how long did that take

269
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
About

270
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
3 months to months

271
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Beerfest RPI

272
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
And and so what was the tell me about the first issue what was it what was that

273
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
John Lennon was on a cover-up

274
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
A photo of him

275
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
As private group reading a movie how I won the war and that came back to the league

276
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Take a picture of Elena but just whatever free publicity photographs are flying around the time we're looking for

277
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,287
Or something and there was a package of of a pictures that movie was just coming out me just took that one of John and

278
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Dress up as a soldier in training to be Bryant-Denny

279
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,711
But looking back at it the choice of John Lennon Harper cover our first issue was you know

280
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
More than for 2 minutes and what was inside

281
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
Reviews of shows in San Francisco

282
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Navigation to what has happened to the money that have been earned at the Monterey Pop Festival give me a charity or not

283
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
So you looked into that along with

284
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,591
Traditional journalism

285
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
So tell me about just

286
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
Getting them articles in the deadlines we are writers going out and and making deadline

287
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,439
Working around the clock to get this thing out was it a weekly was it a monthly or every other week

288
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
What we had very few Riders

289
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,375
And it's very hard to push them too hard for all volunteer if you're not paying anybody

290
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Asking

291
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Do things like everybody's like

292
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
In view of the same spirit and enthusiasm for it

293
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Anna

294
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
You know people really pitched in and

295
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
And didn't we are look at that thing out of it

296
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Without fail from then on out

297
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
I'm assuming that you despite the fact that you were

298
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,343
In the store the center of the sex drugs and rock and roll

299
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
You know culture you kind of

300
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Couldn't really take partner too much cuz you have to run a magazine

301
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
You have to publish that

302
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Well

303
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
How can I ask

304
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
You could do both

305
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
But you really want to have to sacrifice for the other I mean

306
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Once it gets going

307
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Andaz

308
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Pru trying to print something every two weeks

309
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
You really have no time

310
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
To think of anything but

311
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
The next day more copy more

312
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Car stories

313
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
And all the little things that go into

00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
The Mailroom as well as the other

315
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
And how did you fund it did you have to also

316
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
To put

317
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
Well we tried to sell Adam again if you had your NetSpend

318
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
There was not

319
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Much revenue

320
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
$500 an issue.

321
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
So how much runway did you have with that $7,500

322
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
What's her no cuz as that one

323
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567

Banana from advertisers and people might be

00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
Start subscribing paying $5 a year so I need that so there's enough to

327
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
To keep it going at it sooner or later e

329
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975

330
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
N

331
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
By the end of the first year

332
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
We were of viable business with three or four people

333
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Being paid getting it out regularly

334
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
Selling Thirty or forty thousand cops an issue

335
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
People will respond with the breadcrumbs at like 8 we're getting letters and correspondence and recognition from very sorry

336
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
In the first year we

337
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
Pop's long interview with Pete Townsend interview

338
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Jagger

339
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,647
So it was making it was good Gathering momentum people like what they saw

340
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Did you have that Advantage because you were the only

341
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Magazine like this out there

342
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Well

343
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Yes

344
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
Nobody else is trying to do this I mean the primary mainstream press didn't care at all about this

345
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Figure corner of American culture or give much Credence or thought the idea there's a kind of a booming new general

346
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
Duration about to take over the Baby Boomers going to have a big impact that time still

347
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Music was looked down upon

348
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Has Teenage nonsense or ephemeral to say the least done by people look really strange in a long hair

349
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
You're not really acceptable people

350
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
But

351
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,679
Nonetheless music was become tribal Telegraph the drums are beating for Yankee

352
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
People around the world but you can never communicate with each other to other people like them around the world we're doing until

353
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,199
This is the way young people communicate there was nothing else

354
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
So do you remember

355
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
When the magazine started to get

356
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Attention was it

357
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,439
Year two three like 100 start to become something people just talk about

358
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
A twin brother

359
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Time to get live intentions on the first year anniversary

360
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
We printed

361
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,655

The other one

364
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Shod Diamondback sizing

365
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Then

Picture of them

375
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,743
But we had we sold out the printing we print more than just kind of got more more people talking

376
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
And then I think

377
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
2

378
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375

Time Magazine about us

And then

392
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Finally made a deal with

393
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
The more of a national

394
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999

397
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
And start appearing more more around the country

398
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,471
The More We Fear the more people liked it more subscriptions came in more Revenue

399
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,847
Came in so we thought we really had a going business you know after the first year I don't think

400
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
We had a question about

401
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Survival at 4

402
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Turn on the road tell me how you came across Hunter Thompson

403
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
It's fair to say he was your first

404
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Really big breakthrough writer

405
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,743
New Hunter's work before I start rolling stone here in the book

406
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Call the Hell's Angels

407
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
And so I just wrote him a letter after a startling sound asking

408
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Time to write something

409
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
And he Robaxin Gees he didn't really

410
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Reading limestone is terrific

411
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Second grade

412
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
He loved to write

413
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Pretty good right now

414
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
Because he was busy involved in running for Sheriff Aspen

415
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Colorado

416
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
So I wrote him back that will wanted you right about that

417
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
And what she did and which we publish couple months later

418
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
This called

419
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
The Battle of Azeroth

420
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Freak power in the Rockies

421
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
And of course the idea that he's running for

422
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Aspen

423
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Cotton or synthetic

424
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Retention

425
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
You know in media place around the world Moab Sun News

Film Crews

429
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
New York from London so far like that

430
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,615
That was once again it started just a reputation growing more

431
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,247
1972 I mean that when I was a huge

432
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,087
Found her Thompson's work when I was stressed when I was younger

433
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
And I mean

434
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
You had this guy

435
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,743
To cover the 1972 McGovern campaign

436
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
A serious presidential

437
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Campaign

438
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,679
Was any part of you like me this is a risky this guy's you know he's coming

439
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
Use what drugs in these a little bit nuts and maybe they'll maybe that's what it took

440
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,151
I'm by that time hundred written a couple

441
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Serious

442
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
Deep investigative pieces for us on

443
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Like East La Mexicana movie

444
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
He said we're done

445
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
Fear and loathing Las Vegas and he had become our

446
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,255
Star Rider star reporter size always on the lookout for both be the next right thing for under to do

447
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
So the

448
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Election comes along

449
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Does the first time

450
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
The AC

451
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
Franchise to vote

452
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Is it in a

453
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
War situations was the anti-war election

454
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
And Hunter

455
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
Had this kind of global background everyone for sharing mean

456
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
Having bad actually covered Nixon years before

457
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
So it was just kind of natural thing I mean

458
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
American politics why not send out an expert on the Hell's Angels

459
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087

Play Welcome Back to how I built this from NPR I'm kyroz

481
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
So it's the early 1970s Rolling Stones

482
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:43,712
Trying to get a lot of national attention at this point is operating out of a brand new office

483
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Publish in color and acid dropping

484
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Auto journalist

485
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,464
Cover the 1972 presidential election

486
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
Nothing nothing says that you can take a stand and tell her that maybe even better than without asking

487
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
Traditional journalism look if you're trying to make a presidential election at that time

488
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Interesting to young people

489
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
If you are basically turned off the political process

490
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
You have to make it interesting and McGovern was an interesting personality and Nixon

491
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,160
Set timer well-defined villain so it was kind of setup for doing

492
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,232
Really good writing and Reporting and

493
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
The traditional coverage hours

494
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Bloodless

495
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Another one in

496
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
I broke all that app

497
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
And became the most compelling

498
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
Writer and reporter on that campaign

499
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
As everybody well acknowledge what was he like to work with me and was he

500
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Reliable was he

501
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
Reliable

502
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
Erratic

503
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
A lot of what we call hand holding

504
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
I mean he was

505
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Erratica news

506
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
Yeah Moody and energetic and

507
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
All of the map but he was also

508
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
A professional

509
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
Superba Porter brilliant writer

510
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
Deep sense of responsibility about things

511
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
And though he would

512
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
Working till the very last minute deadlines

513
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
And almost drive you crazy and

514
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Bring you right to the edge

515
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
In the end he always still ever

516
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
It always count

517
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
So I was I had a great time

518
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Took a lot of my time

519
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
It was raining

520
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Exhaustion can do

521
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
But the net effect was

522
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Patricia Brewing Pizza

523
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
To work in the terms of company in Tyler

524
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
I was also

525
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
One of the key things are like

526
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Finally put Rolling Stone the map in a big way

527
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
Everybody depressed quiz

528
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Everything everything

529
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
And people around kangaroo riveted by what he had to

530
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
But by that time

531
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
We are pretty serious

532
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
Rock Roll magazine free

533
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Why do Spectators starting a lot advertising lot advertise

534
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
And that we were on our way

535
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,064
That was no help Growing Pains

536
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Well after about three years we

537
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Went to a real

538
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Rush

539
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
With running out of money

540
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Which lasted

541
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
Who is moved Austin sounds

542
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,864

Expansive office

545

So then all the overhead that entails and

546
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
We are spending money without really thinking about it all so real so much

547
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
You going to run out of money

548
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
And we switch to a big National

551
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
And once we got to that

552
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Restart

00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
I mean really

555
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
I can bring him

556
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
People who are

557
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
CPAs

558
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Or have account

559
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
10 degrees are at some reasonable business background

560
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Manage things in

561
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Back to the money

562
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
And

563
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
Over here. Just got more more professional

564
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Once we move when we move to New York

565
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
77 I mean that really was

566
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
And I was really hitting the

567
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
Why did you New York via why'd you do that why'd you leave San Francisco and 7

568
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
2/2 ovens

569
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
What's going to happen

570
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
We had a lot of

571
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
People Lottery

572
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
So

573
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
It was clear we had to do it in one place and also the magazine business

574
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Was in New York so if you want all that

575
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Resources

576
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Talent

577
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
They were available in New York

578
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Industry

579
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
So it's kind of a no-brainer

580
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Doing

581
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
We went and did it and ended up on

582
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
5th Avenue

583
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,480
At the time Ian you were quoted as saying San Francisco is a cultural Backwater

584
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
And that's why we're moving

585
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Did you

586
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
Beach resorts in Trinidad

587
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
There was that Heyday only started

588
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Which had not only this thriving rock and roll

589
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
But it's private

590
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Political call

591
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Alternate

592
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,912
Are there left of the black pants and all sorts of things are happening

593
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Sort of by the time you move

594
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
I'm New York assigned to have its moment

595
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Starting to come back

596
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
And we arrived just at that

597
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Male rosary

598
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Andy Warhol

599
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
And then

600
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Closure backwaters is

601
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
It was just

602
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
The provincial

603
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
And I was out in the cold

604
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
It was awful to me

605
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
It wasn't

606
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Putting up this big unique

607
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Cultural thing in music anymore

608
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
Yo-yo

609
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
That New York office

610
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
1970s

611
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Rolling Stones basically espousing a kind of

612
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Counterculture

613
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Aesthetic

614
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,176
But you were the boss when you were the man

615
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
So how do you balance

616
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Running a counterculture

617
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
Magazine for also

618
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,624
And tired of having to be a jerk sometimes

619
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
The people who weren't

620
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Being productive or whatever

621
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Well I mean

622
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
It wasn't

623
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,584
Too difficult I mean really. I never quite believed in

624
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
The counterculture

625
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Welchol patent alternate

626
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
But definitely you don't you answer

627
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Value systems

628
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
You good

629
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
Trying to be fair to people instead of being

630
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
Have less money only

631
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
So it was always a bit of a balancing act but I think everybody quite understand it

632
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
They everybody wanted to go

633
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Get paid you know

634
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
If you have family you want supper

635
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
I'm so I don't think anybody

636
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Really deeply questions

637
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
The need to have a

638
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
Prophetess taking a

639
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Professional

640
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
I mean it was somehow Courtside critics in early days of

641
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Oh your friends

642
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
The best for your hippie capitalist

643
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Contradiction

644
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Both

645
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Give me a stop

646
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
Wasn't nothing

647
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
And at that point were you did you start to really get interested in the business side of things are you looking at p&l

648
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
Are you looking at the bottom line where you

649
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Doing that too

650
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
Well I guess I wasn't myself doing his I was always

651
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Had some of their eyes

652
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,720
CEO CFO

653
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Who's read the daily response

654
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
And that person report to me and I look at it and over

655
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
You'll have oversight over it

656
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
Try to understand

657
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Try to give Direct

658
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Directions to tricks

659
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Kid YouTube

660
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
I didn't have control the day

661
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Operation

662
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
But when you're

663
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Involved in something like

664
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
That stage isn't that when things are

665
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
Growing all the time and getting better and more more money is coming in

666
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
You don't have to be

667
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
2

668
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Hof

669
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Commander

670
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
You know

671
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
You're the victim of

672
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Success from outside

673
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
You know just

674
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
It time

675
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Brings along the true test of

676
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Of how

677
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,704
Have a businessman URL showed his when things are not going so

678
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,824
What was your time after you move to New York with things were not going well with a magazine

679
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
Wake me up at 12

680
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Came up we had spent a lot of money

681
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Moving

682
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
And moving to fancy new off salt

683
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Stop at the same time

684
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
I started a new publication called outside

685
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
And left that in San Francisco

686
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
And there came a point where it was just too much

687
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
We can both magazine

688
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Play sold out

689
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
Did you did you sell for profit

690
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Sold it for

691
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
About what I

692
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Put into it

693
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
But I couldn't afford to be sustained both magazines

694
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,312
Did that did you feel pressure to I mean I mean

695
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Magazine today of course is not as

696
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,688
Isn't this a different business and it wasn't like 70s

697
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,808
But did you have sleepless nights over whether you know you're going to payroll and he got his own

698
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
By the time we moved New York

699
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Fully up in Opera

700
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Framing Rolling Stone

701
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Was getting to a circulation 1 million,

702
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
1 million

703
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
You're you are a solid

704
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Stable business

705
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
That's a lot of money coming

706
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,704
Did you ever have to find additional outside investment fund funding at any point

707
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Actor that now

708
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,544
I know you would totally self-sufficient

709
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Yeah

710
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,920
So tell me about your I mean how you started to grow because Rolling Stone was this thing of the

711
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
Your baby in

712
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,320
Outside you bought and sold and then you moved on and started by other Publications right

713
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
Restart US Weekly and restart monster

714
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
But the Rolling Stone gulou

715
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Because it was so good

716
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
And because it's so relevant to people's lives

717
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
He got a big big readership

718
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
An advertise Has Fallen

719
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
I mean I guess

720
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
A certain point

721
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,896
XI the criticism of Rolling Stones that time and end in you know this wasn't

722
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
It was about

723
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,016
Things like the things you would cover right and you you're focused on

724
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Try to grow the magazine and make it

725
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Relevant and

726
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
Some people would say well you didn't cover disco frogs

727
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
But you were you missed the punk movement like what is that was very true that

728
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
No

729
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
That we are right on the park

730
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Viton discount

731
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
People hated Disco

732
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
The haters for covering

733
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
Have you hated for covering Punk

734
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
But we're always get

735
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
That's good to hear

736
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
How do you know

737
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
We're going to stay with

738
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
The news or what's

739
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Of Interest

740
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
People

741
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Currently going on popular

742
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,808
We're going to cover it as Leading Edge and sometimes

743

934
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904

I'm always happy people II

936
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,144
I want to ask you about

937
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
A crisis that you guys had

938
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Around the

939
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
DVA story the story about

940
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,640
They publish a few years ago about a rape on campus at University of Virginia

941
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,456
You know which that the central story Turner

942
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,320
False that was a big deal in that was national news so what

943
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
What was the situation like

944
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Are you guys the magazine is it

945
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
That was difficult

946
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,768
But not next

947
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Existential crisis

948
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Made I mean I'm not allowed

951

Amicable settlement

952
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
We made it

953
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Jim bignell

954
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Latoya process

955
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
Yeah and I obviously understand that either

956
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
Because you can't talk about but wait what

957
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
But you are able to talk about how about that

958
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
I don't know how did that affect you first

959
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Why did you

960
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
I was sick of it

961
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
50 years of great

962
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208

Volume stuff and then

965
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
Stackable really bad judgment

966
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Reverse sensor

967
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
It blew up on Ark

968
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
But

Story

973
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
The rape victim

974
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
That was

975
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
Made up by then raping

976
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
And we pray that without adequate

977
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
For the checking

978
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
As you eat as you know

979
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Journalist

980
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,416
It's enough right the minute you get something like that it doesn't matter

981
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Sooner or later you're going to get some

982
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
And I believe the New York Times about

983
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
Was that the ethics it seems like

984
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,680
Up until that point of me of course every publicans going to make mistakes and you guys

985
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
I've had your mistakes over the years but that mean it seems like

986
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
About that was

987
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
Probably the biggest one

988
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
That was always says this one thing that happens

989
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
Do you still own 100% of your company

990
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,024
Is its value publicly about public you keep that private

991
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,376
Upward of let's say when our media report of a quarter million dollars

992
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,496
Whatever you want say I need would you ever sell it

993
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
You know who knows I mean

994
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
Heyday Rolling Stones

997
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736

998
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016

Not working for anybody else

1004
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
Yeah when you sell it you end up working for somebody else

1005
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
And I have every right to tell you what

1006
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
I'm just not a person

1007
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Highlights

1008
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
What to do

1009
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
You are

1010
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
71

1011
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Gunplay started this magazine

1012

50 years ago

1013
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
That's right

1014
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Are you you still going everyday

1015
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
I'm pretty much yeah every day but I'm here in New York

1016
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
Gone about four months of the year by months

1017
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
So when do you

1018
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
When do you stop being involved in throwing some ever

1019
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Well I don't know as long as I can make a good country

1020
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
I think I still do it

1021
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
I can still feel and I

1022
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
Going to have an idea that good story ideas are good

1023
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Good instincts

1024
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
A story should be in

1025
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
Make those kind of contributions

1026
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
Story ideas

1027
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312

00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Delighted in one computers

1029

Do that

1030
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
The men I see a padlock

1031
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Failing and coming outside he's always looking at me

1032
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Old man

1033
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:04,927
And I think I'm down

1034

Daughter of Rolling Stone magazine and it seemed like he doesn't have a plan for Rolling Stones future

1035
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
Not entirely true John's 26 year old son Gus is poised to take over the family business

1036
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:24,127
When God stepped down in fact Gus was the one who wrote us and said hey you should put my dad on the show

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

1048
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,887
I know for how you built that and this week story comes to us from Joel Crites

1049
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,751
Hi guy Joel is from Cleveland he's a huge Cleveland sports fan

1050
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,103
A few years ago he was at an Indian's game with his 16 year old son

1051
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,711
It was a beautiful summer night of baseball and Joel was loving it

1052
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,367
But he just wasn't into the action of the game you didn't really care about the outcome and you know it wasn't into the

1053
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
The standings

1054
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
This is boring let's go and I said something to the effect of know I paid to be here tonight

1055
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
Are you going to sit there and like it many of us have been in a similar situation this is no fun for Kobe

1056
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
It's no fun for Joel

1057
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,847
So in that moment Joel suggested a game

1058
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
He tried to Kobe and he said

1059
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
Hey why don't we try to predict what the next batter is going to do

1060
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
Strikeout hit a homer walk whatever

1061
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
And whoever predicts correctly

1062
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,671
Winter Haven fine and within the very next at-bat

1063
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,767
We were laughing and high-fiving and I thought I had just struck gold

1064
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:23,167
SOA actor that every time Joel went to see baseball he played the game with his other kids as well and he started to

1065
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
Tell his friends about it especially Friends With Kids

1066
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,383
He realize that a lot of fans were already doing the same thing people have told me I play this with my grandpa

1067
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,991
When we predict the at-bats and we use you know this and that to keep track of the score

1068
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
And people in the bullpen hoverboard when they're watching again evil do some version of it till about a year later she wondered what

1069
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,791
Whether he might turn this idea into a smartphone app and app that you could play at home or in the snow

1070
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,911
Stadium against other fans were all watching the live game in real time

1071
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
But he needed to set up a way of scoring

1072
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:02,079
How many points for a predicted strike or a home run or double play

1073
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,895
Well fortunately in his day job

1074
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295
Joe is an accountant I quickly got out my spreadsheets and started downloading statistics to figure out

1075
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,183
What should the different predictions for an at-bat be worth based on their statistical likelihood

1076
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,303
So there's groundout worth two points strike out his three points

1077
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
Single

1078
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,983
Four Points eventually higher developer to build out a smartphone app

1079
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,383
He put it out into the world I literally print it off flyers and I stood outside of our local Stadium

1080
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,783
Just asking people to play and that's how I got it off the grounds initially

1081
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,183
Is one one thing because I'm a huge baseball fan to a lot of games

1082
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
Magical about being in a stadium or Arena

1083
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Gaming and having our devices off I don't know I just feel like I feel like you surrendered

1084
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
Sad note this is a reality and I'm just going to

1085
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
I'm just going to go with it is in some ways I have but in the times we live in I mean the baseball

1086
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
Average age of a viewer nowadays is gone from age 53 to 57 in the past decade so

1087
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
You got to find the way to reach the kids in this is this is what I've come up with Joel's already license the app to a few

1088
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
Do amateur baseball teams and even a few professional softball teams he's only made a few thousand dollars

1089
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,799
So far but he's hoping to expand the idea to other sports like football and basketball and May

1090
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:43,199
Maybe eventually even to sports bars the focus is to honestly make its new standard for fan engagement across the world

1091
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,343
Because there's nothing to prevent us from offering it in Latin America and Korea and Japan and everywhere
