Aspiring entrepreneurs in the world

And many of them will be hanging around a chat and give advice

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Literally

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,968
People like David neeleman of JetBlue

23
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
Stewart Butterfield

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040

This conference

28

Unlike any other you

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Ever attended

30
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
It's designed to build

31
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Nurturing

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
Community Builders

33
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,448
Come join us in San Francisco October 22nd and 23rd

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
I'll see you there

36
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
To find out more about the summit

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Go to Summit

38
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
. NPR

39
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Really good or I'm something really bad and really bad I'm a big problem

40
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
And look what I've done I've let down all these people all these employees all these investors

41
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
All these people who believed in me and I just couldn't live with that

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
NPR how I built this a show of that innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Dave Dahl after years

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,376
Prison drug he's turned his life around by baking Loaves and healthy whole wheat bread

45
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Dave's

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Killer Bread

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
Clear lessons we've learned from making the show

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
The story matters

49
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
It's the why you do what you do

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
But more importantly

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
It's the thing that allows your customers to

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
Deepen their connection to your product or brand

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
But companies and businesses don't always put their stories on the label

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
Think about Roxanne Quimby selling beeswax candles

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
Farmers markets in Maine while trying to scale-up Burt's Bees

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,080
Oravsky towels wondered Pastor burrito shop in San Francisco's Mission District in the late 1980s and

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Came up with Chipotle

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
Now it's highly unlikely that you buy Burt's Bees products or butt Chipotle burrito because of the storm

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
If you're a fan of either company

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Probably just like what they make

61
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
But in the case of Dave's Killer Bread

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
The story was true

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Early success

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
And it was printed on the wrapper of every loaf

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
The story has more struggle

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
And probably

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Any story weave

68
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Featured on the show so far

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
It is 20 States all was a pretty messed-up guy

70
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
A loser those are actually his own words

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
And he spent a lot of time in prison

72
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
They thought he might even die Behind Bars

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Eventually

74
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Transformers thinking

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
And what was released from prison

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Went home to his family bakery

77
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
He started making bread

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
Really good bread and people loved it

79
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
And the family bakery group pretty quickly

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Seven years on they were selling Dave's Killer Bread across the Northwest doing over 50

81
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
$10 in sales

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
They was born in Portland Oregon in 1960

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
3 where his family ran a small bakery

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Your mom and dad were Seventh-Day Adventists

85
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
It's a denomination known to practice a really healthy diet

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
No alcohol no caffeine

87
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Lots of grain

88
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Indeed family

89
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
They were very conservative

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
My mom was very religious my dad was a believer

91
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
They were very strict

92
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
And we were expected

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Be honest we were taught

94
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
B

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Truthful we were taught not to fight

96
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
You know everything was about getting ready for the afterlife

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Heaven

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
What's your parents do for a living what was there it was their business

99
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Well they were Bakers

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
And my dad was a

101
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Hard-working man

102
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
We did lots of different

103
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Jobs are jobs until he was able to

104
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
Muster up enough money to buy a bakery that was failing and

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
That's where he started back in the 50s

106
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,639
And so they did a lot of birthday cakes and donuts even and all that stuff

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
But

108
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
At some point my dad

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Decided

110
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
That you weren't

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Do more

112
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
More whole grains and

113
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Gnu animal facts

114
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Networks news

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Revolutionary the time

116
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah but that was definitely the Seventh Day Adventist influence

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
So because of their religious

118
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Reviews he's he's thinking

119
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
How much are making

120
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
You know healthier whole grain breads which must have been kind of a

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Hippy dippy saying in the in the

122
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Late 60s early 70s right

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
Yeah that's a funny thing is my dad was the opposite of a hippie

124
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
He did he did try to go with more of a liberal

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
Sort of liberal mindset for a while but

126
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
He even stand hippies

127
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Maybe we'll just get so upset then

128
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Zippy's Wahiawa Hawaii

129
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
He had to like them because they were keeping him

130
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Business but

131
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
There was a Justin

132
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
You know he was he was basically 4% of a Nixon Republican

133
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,127
Earliest memories just working in the bakery with your siblings

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Yeah some of the

135
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Stand-out memories

136
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
We're maybe going and visiting my dad

137
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
Where he was working this you had to be a certain age and certain size to be able to

138
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Work in the bakery

139
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
Yeah be able to get your hands up over the work table

140
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
And I was nine years old when I was

141
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
Rams able to start working of course

142
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
I couldn't wait to start working

143
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
And what would you do in this Bakery as a kid

144
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Mainly we had one of these cookies machines that had $2 that would dispense cookies

145
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,479
And we were making natural cookies

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
For these

147
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
Happy places

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
We didn't work on Saturday because we were 17

149
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,487
Right that's the day of rest right and the church that's right yeah but Sunday's

150
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
We're wide open ever soften our biggest day of working

151
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Are the Adventist

152
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
That was their day off

153
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Recreation

154
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
What's Sunday

155
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
So I was a little bit reason I became more and more resentful

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
That young age that I wasn't able to go to these

157
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Be a part of what my my peers were doing

158
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
But

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Yeah we work

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
We work our butts off on Sundays

161
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
And his Bakery was not like

162
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
Hugely profitable really you did not grow up with lots of money right

163
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
No we we work for a little bit of money

164
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
I remember starting at $0.25 an hour

165
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,703
And part of that money part of that $0.25 went to paying for my school and clothes

166
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
So what do you remember

167
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Like at what age do you remember starting to

168
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Rebelled against

169
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Against repair

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
It must have been about

171
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
11 or 12 probably 12 by the time I started looking at

172
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Sing just like

173
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Well

174
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
I don't believe this

175
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Goffin height

176
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
You know I read

177
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
The Bible I started up

178
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Grayson siriboe

179
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
I made a decision

180
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,655
When I started having doubts that I would just read the Bible and hopefully God would

181
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Tell me

182
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
You know what I need to know

183
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
And it didn't work

184
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
I'm going to just give me more.

185
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
So

186
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
I started being more and more

187
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
No fighting with my dad mom

188
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
By the time I was 13 14

189
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
And

190
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
My mom was just really bummed out

191
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
About it cuz she tried everything she could to try to help me

192
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Get back to the face

193
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
My dad was just mad he was just angry

194
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Yeah it sounds like

195
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
At that point was probably sir typical teenage

196
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Rebellion

197
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
What are you doing

198
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
Drugs that pointer or not

199
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
No I drink a little

200
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
I think I was 14 when I first drank some beer

201
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Smoke some weed

202
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
Eventually it was got to be more and more of that

203
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,111
Not really agree with me to didn't do me any any favors

204
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
But at this point I was trying to find my way

205
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Outside of the Adventist world

206
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
And

207
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
Find another misfit

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Did you did you finish High School

209
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
No I took off

210
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Itrip

211
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
On their second day of my senior year

212
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,151
Pick up cross country got stuck in the Braska and turn around came back

213
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
But you just took out you just like

214
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Decided to

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Just go

216
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
Ashura

217
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
I always was like I was wondering throw myself into situations and see what have

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
Android 17 and

219
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
I took off on this trip and I was about as naive as

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
And agreeing about life as you could get it

221
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
It started a

222
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
Sort of a lifelong thing of running away

223
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
I'm changing

224
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
Going somewhere and having to run away from there you know

225
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
Everywhere I went I was running away but

226
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
There I was

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Every time

228
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
I guess pretty soon after you've dropped out of high school and we're trying to figure things out you

229
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Decided to

230
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
To enlist in the Marines

231
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,887
It was just one more when were grass greener on the other side kind of an idea

232
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
And a friend of mine

233
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:21,823
Women's emergency was another Misfit like me another you know we would call ourselves losers that gas station

234
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Do you want the Marines and it was just

235
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
He came back transform

236
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Art's First Transformation I ever saw in my life

237
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
And

238
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
I thought well you know they can make a man out of me to write

239
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,207
But I went in the Marines and I wasn't ready for that

240
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,279
I just got hell I got help from those

241
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Jokes.

242
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
And

243
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
I couldn't take it I wasn't I wasn't built for it in those days

244
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
2

245
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,799
Then I didn't have a thick skin at all and I eventually took off

246
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Ran from there

247
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
So you head back to

248
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Portland after that in

249
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
What did you do what do you remember about that time

250
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
Wasn't too long after that that I ended up getting married

251
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
It was just another crazy idea

252
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
And

253
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
I meant

254
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
My my first daughter

255
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
And we got married and

256
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,959
I was drinking and at this point I probably started doing

257
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Cocaine

258
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,639
I was just doing cocaine but I wasn't at a level on a serious addiction level it was just a recreational level

259
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
So you are 22

260
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Yeah kid

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
And you didn't

262
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Really have much

263
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Teacher

264
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
You know many fly prospects for the future

265
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,791
That's exactly yet I mean at that time I had no

266
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Perspective on

267
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
You can go out in

268
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
And learn to become too

269
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Create a life for yourself but

270
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
I didn't know that I didn't see that and I just thought I was born to lose I don't know anything everybody else

271
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
Else knows more than I do everybody else has

272
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Is more

273
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Built For Life

274
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,623
And I like myself I had such add and even though nobody would have

275
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
Calling 8080dn downstairs and I didn't

276
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Have anyone that could diagnose me like that

277
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
I couldn't focus on a conversation

278
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
What we're having right now there's no way I could

279
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,031
I couldn't listen to anything and that's no problem I had the Marine Corps as I

280
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
I couldn't listen and I also was

281
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
I refuse to wear glasses and I was supposed to wear glasses

282
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
So I couldn't see

283
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
The chalkboard

284
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
I was just like

285
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
Lot of stuff with converging there

286
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
And a lot of bad stuff

287
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
I was just low self-esteem depression

288
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
I am I my thought was always

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,143
Well who wouldn't be depressed with a life like mine you know

290
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
That's a tough time in life for

291
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Truck from most people

292
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
In general

293
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
Your brain is changing there's all kinds of things happen in Europe

294
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,943
Set of all of a sudden expected to be an adult here you are you got a child

295
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
With what appears to be like a growing

296
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Alcohol and drug addiction and

297
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Undiagnosed depression

298
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
On top of that

299
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
All those things and then I would smoke weed

300
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
I would do acid IB honesty

301
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
And

302
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Almost always of the terrible results because

303
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Your mind you can't go into

304
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Trip like that

305
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
I have a my mind it's all torn up

306
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
I just gets worse

307
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Remember the first time you use

308
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,855
Yes I do is the best it was my first transformation in life

309
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,719
It was the first time that I saw that my life could be a lot better at least an

310
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Might think

311
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
The time

312
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
Wow and liquids retarded pranking

313
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
And

314
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
I'd always been warned Craigslist

315
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
Only for the

316
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
The lowest of the low

317
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
But at that point I was like well

318
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
I am kind of the lowest

319
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
109 brace

320
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
And

321
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
I didn't your very first time that I did the math

322
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Put it my arm

323
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
And

324
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
I was instantly

325
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Happy

326
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
And

327
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Ready to go

328
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
And kick ass and

329
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
They made me just forget all the things that they were messing me up and I kind of just left the world that I was in

330
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
This bomber world that I was at and went to a world where I was happy

331
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,567
Problem with it would be when I would run out

332
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
And that happened a lot

333
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Does yuan have money to

334
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
To get more if you have a job

335
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Yeah

336
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
The first

337
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
You know I was working at the bakery

338
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
This is your family bakery

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
Yeah and last thing in the world I wanted to do was be a baker

340
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
I didn't want to be with my dad was I didn't want to be what anybody my family was

341
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
I

342
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Didn't want to be

343
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,679
This guy always stop being a baker was a sissy thing you know

344
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
But I didn't know what else to do

345
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543
Eventually it was unsustainable

346
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
And so I lost that job and I

347
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Started doing

348
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
Car burglaries then eventually business and house burned

349
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
To the pain

350
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
For the dog

351
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
And you would steal things in like take him to pawn shops

352
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Well we had

353
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
Countryside I would work with guys who have a little bit more experience

354
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Vision

355
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
They would

356
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Find ways to

357
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Transportation

358
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,471
You know I I would feel guilty at times when I was robbing someone to see the kefir

359
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,591
Did they add I would feel that guilt and I never actually saying I'm sorry

360
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
The one person

361
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
But

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
Didn't matter I still have to do what I have to do

363
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
So since around like 1986-87 and this is going to be the beginning

364
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
Like 14 years maybe more maybe like 16 years

365
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
Remember the first time you were incarcerated for

366
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Berkeley

367
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,823
Like you members but what you how you felt where you were we scare you

368
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
No

369
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
Does that time I could almost

370
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,759
Come to the conclusion that I was eventually going to go to prison

371
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,415
And that would be a good learning experience for me and I didn't like prison don't get me wrong I hated it

372
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
But

373
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,255
I also looked at the start of a badger

374
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Who I was now

375
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Will you

376
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
Were you ever a person violent or angry did you have

377
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Was that inside of you

378
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Throwing up bile

379
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
There's a lot of anger in my family that's one thing that

380
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
What sort of

381
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,199
The team with the territory the baker's all the Bakers in family we were all angry that

382
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Just angry with

383
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
With the world with each other wasn't

384
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
With everything yeah I think

385
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:02,207
Looking Back Now I think my dad had similar problems that I had you know mine

386
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
He was

387
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Probably bipolar like me

388
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
I saw him angry and I saw I'm depressed I'm angry and I saw today

389
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,007
So it sounds like during this period and in prison

390
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
You were cuddling with a combination of

391
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Depression and anger

392
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
And

393
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Addiction

394
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Incredibly low self-esteem

395
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Very long

396
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
I'm suicidal

397
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Many many times

398
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
In my life

399
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
I would I have been suicidal when I put that needle in my arm

400
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
And so

401
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
You know you got understand that right

402
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
I was

403
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Back Against The Wall nothing to lose

404
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
But I did it

405
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
Wow you are and I guess we should contextualize

406
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
The spit while you were

407
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Imprison

408
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
The family bakery was still going on right

409
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Your brother was involved

410
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
With it

411
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
But but why you were in prison

412
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Your dad passed away

413
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
Yeah what are you were you able to go

414
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
To the funeral

415
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
I know because

416
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
I was confined

417
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,887
We talking with your dad at that point

418
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,959
In around the tire yard started to

419
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Want to talk to my dad

420
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
But I wasn't quite to the

421
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
The point that I got

422
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
To later when I really wish that I

423
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
You don't got final

424
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Know some time with them

425
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,343
So you're you're serving your final prison sentence you were going to be

426
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
You going to be incarcerated

427
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
For long time

428
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
2001

429
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
Something happened to you

430
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
Made you start to think about

431
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Your life in

432
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
What you wanted to be what

433
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
What was it what happened that you

434
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,079
Define God as a religious experience like what what was it

435
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
It was like that

436
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
My own form of God I guess

437
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
I experienced enough adversity

438
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Enough

439
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Time where I couldn't run away

440
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
I was either going to take myself out I was going to find a way cuz I really decided there's no reason why I should be able

441
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
But being at the end of my rope like I was

442
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Finally

443
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
Did something that they talk about in AA I Surrender

444
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
I said well I'm going to let these

445
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,663
Authorities may be able to help me I'm going to give them a chance to help me

446
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,271
And it was a big deal because it's like you're telling on yourself in there you know

447
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Last thing you want to do is tell the authorities

448
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
What's on your mind

449
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
But that was the wrong advice there right advice was just let down your guard and get some help

450
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,655
And I wasn't long after that I got called in and

451
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,775
I didn't tell him everything I didn't say I was suicidal because I didn't want to get in more trouble

452
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
But he said

453
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
Well look weird without this stuff compax or y'all try it

454
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Rashad and

455
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,855
It was a Chantix quite a while to take effect but

456
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Very quick with me and I

457
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,743
Sometimes I don't know how much of it was just the humility and

458
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,095
No deal that it took them to make that happen that change line

459
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,239
Yeah I think it might have been partial partially placebo effect by thinking

460
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
I think the drug did help

461
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
It works

462
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,455
I've been on a waiting list for a computer aided drafting program which was a vocational training opportunity very rare

463
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Very rare

464
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
A great opportunity

465
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Found out

466
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
The first I was just scared to death of it

467
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,719
Computers and your drafting I have no idea what they're talking about

468
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
But this time I

469
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
I didn't give up and I think a lot of the reason why I didn't give up is because of those meds and because I

470
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
I come to the point where I love and acceptance of who I am

471
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Urgent Care Winona

472
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
I thought of miso

473
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,175
So I had a great time I just started within a couple weeks I was having a blast in there

474
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
And that changed my life

475
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
So you're you're in prison you're taking this drafting computer

476
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Braided drafting course inside course you are

477
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
On antidepressants

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
You spent

479
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Most of the previous 15 years of your life

480
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
Prison Blues sounds like

481
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
Assertive woke up one day like I'm almost 40

482
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
My

483
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
My perspective is changing I'm not your Dremel anymore obviously this is not working. I am not good at that

484
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
Definitely say

485
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
So December 27th

486
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
2 days after Christmas

487
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
2004

488
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
You are released

489
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
The day you walked out of prison your brother Glenn

490
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
I reserved

491
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Pick you up right

492
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,792
Remember any of the conversation was

493
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
I don't know who is he

494
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,912
He's your older brother isn't English 9 years older than you was he

495
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
8 years old

496
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Was he

497
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,544
I don't know did he scold you was he judgmental Rosie just like hey you're out

498
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,896
No no I think that it seems different to me but he was still worried

499
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
But he

500
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,576
How to see what was going on when I was doing the Drafting and things and just gold deal where

501
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
Stop blaming people

502
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Accountability

503
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
I didn't blame the system

504
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
The judge

505
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
It was all luck

506
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
I did this

507
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,144
I can I'm the one who's got the power to change it

508
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
So

509
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
I think my brother was a little bit

510
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Put off by my

511
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Energy

512
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
It was a little bit too much

513
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Ikea

514
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
I can understand that I mean I would be wary to write

515
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
If if

516
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
That was me he had been sort of

517
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
Dutiful Network

518
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
Phone number for running your parents

519
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
Bakery in business and

520
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:58,048
Yeah he had managed to keep the business going various Ways by telling you cuz he was a hard worker and some

521
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Mark

522
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,168
Somehow they managed to become contract

523
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Manufacturers of

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Stratford Trader Joe's which is really the best butterfly

525
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Business before I go

526
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
So when he picked you up after you released did he say alright listen you know we got some work for you at the bakery

527
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
And watch coming and not working for us

528
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
A couple days is that is that what he said

529
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,184
The way I remember is that I asked him if I could come back

530
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Cuz I've been thinking about how I

531
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
Make you think I can make a difference in the company

532
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
And show

533
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
He

534
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Gave me that opportunity

535
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
I mean

536
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Improve myself at the very low

537
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Brie Larson

538
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
4 bucks an hour

539
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
Just baking loaves of bread and basically

540
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
That was the

541
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Priority

542
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Spread

543
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,784
Is a bigger thing was the marketing is how how can how can we appeal to younger

544
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,928
We were getting eaten up by the big guys who figured out ways to sell bread that was more popular

545
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
Sure I mean Glen

546
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
He said he could see where he could see the writing on the wall at the big

547
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Companies

548
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
We're coming in undercutting

549
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
I mean they were probably there crossword

550
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Follower

551
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,312
NHRA Fred wasn't telling you had to do was you had to do something right

552
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
In order for this business to grow

553
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,456
VA circuit asked you to kind of look around

554
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Yeah I figured it out

555
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
The one thing I think they're the coolest thing that my brother

556
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Dad was

557
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,904
Connor just let me do my thing you you said well

558
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Very very much about their and stuff

559
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Because of my experimenting with

560
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
As a drafter that's what you do you

561
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Replicate

562
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
And then you

563
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Make it better

564
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
Right yeah

565
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
That's what I did I would replicate other

566
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,920
Friday's our brother kind of bread they were they were popular on the market like we were just experimenting in the bakery and just

567
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Trying different

568
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Flowers out in Grantsville

569
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
I had always wanted to make

570
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Get bread with great text

571
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
And

572
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,208
And one of the things I love is natural whole grain cereal

573
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
It's not

574
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Beat up too much

575
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,304
Got to have some good shooting and stuff

576
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,144
And it doesn't matter to be weed oats whatever

577
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
So

578
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,008
I made a Soaker where you take the grass greens

579
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
And did you make them soft enough to make bread out of

580
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
But not too soft

581
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,920
So is texture that I was aiming for

582
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
4 + I was going for sort of a brown sugary flavor

583
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:30,368
Without brown sugar and soy are used organic cane juice and molasses for that flavor

584
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,280
I wanted to be like a masterpiece Sunday of our two and I didn't call it to the bread right away

585
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Call the police Brad

586
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
The first one another

587
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
Yeah beautiful blue collar to act like I was aiming for

588
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Attitude attitude

589
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
That blue color

590
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,384
Is just blue cornmeal

591
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
Like you rolled the labret the dough

592
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
Into the inside and out

593
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
And

594
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,832
Every breath that I made pretty much are named first

595
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
And then I created

596
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
So I never think I wear makeup

597
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
Europa Blues by one of my for My bride is going to be called Blue

598
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
Cuz I love the blues I like then I was like

599
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Well the other one was always killer Brett and I always wanted to make a variety called Killer Bread

600
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,360
And the biggest difference in it was it it was made with nuts and seeds rather than just

601
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Seeds and greens

602
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,736
When you were experimenting with the different kinds of Breads in the

603
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
What would become Dave's Killer

604
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Red Lake

605
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,440
I don't remember taking that first low-fat remember remember knowing that didn't remember about that

606
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
Oh man it was great I never forget it

607
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,608
It had a great fullness to it

608
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
Your beauty

609
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
To the shape

610
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,240
And the blue Carmel was

611
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
I just made it like no other bread before it

612
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
It was really beautiful

613
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
I took it out of the oven X5 low

614
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
And

615
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Tasted it

616
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Pretty quickly and as I girl got this is good I mean

617
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
It fits my flavor profile

618
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,440
You know what I want and then I gave a loaf

619
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Toarmina's guy

620
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
I think we had like 25-30

621
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,144
Employees at the time that the maintenance guy

622
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
Took one home and it came back the next day and he just couldn't stop raving about

623
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,384
Eventually. No more people to

624
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
More people are starting to

625
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Jd.com

626
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Goodbye

627
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:39,136
Kid cashew technical question because obviously right like I Made bread and

628
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
I mean a big things before and

629
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
Can you take out of the oven and eat

630
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,888
Right away like whether it's a chocolate chip cookie or a piece of bread

631
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Is amazed girl

632
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,800
The test is whether it still good 4 hours later right

633
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
So I can imagine your bread was amazing but like this had to be

634
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,480
Bread that considered shelf of a supermarket or grocery store

635
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
So I had it like

636
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
Still great like I don't know

637
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
5 hours later

638
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,696
The next day we party every would beat it

639
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
Not because that's very hard not a good test

640
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
Oh how good it is and you know

641
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
The process

642
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
About how it's done and rotated and everything

643
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,800
Now it's got to be got to be good for 5 days on the Shelf

644
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,128
There and it's got to be good for a few days once I get it

645
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
Yeah they don't

646
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
People

647
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,504
Really didn't expect it to be the last forever

648
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,064
Cuz it's natural and doesn't have

649
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Chemicals in air

650
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Yasso

651
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Herb actor

652
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,976
That was my slogan just say no to bread on drugs

653
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Those days that was pretty popular slogan

654
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Alright so you make that loaf

655
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,680
Your maintenance guy comes back the next day

656
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,288
You know that you're onto something and then did you did you go to Glen your brother and say

657
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Hey try this out

658
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah I wanted him to love it you know

659
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
But it wasn't his idea of a

660
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Killer part of a great brat

661
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
What are given so much credit for

662
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Is that

663
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Even though he didn't really like my bread

664
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,488
He understood that it wasn't his taste buds it matter

665
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,304
Totally

666
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Give him props for that

667
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
He wasn't controlling

668
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Like most companies

669
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
Would say I hate you

670
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
We got to keep this in this price

671
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
You can't go beyond this and

672
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
Fortunately he did not say that

673
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,688
I remember when we got to the point

674
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
Realizing we did a cost analysis on it and we started realizing how much we're going to sell this for

675
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
And it was it more difficult bread to make that and then

676
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
The average loft bed

677
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
How much did you have to sell it for

678
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
We went to the farmers market

679
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
And we sold it at $4

680
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,008
Mandu nothing brings was 450 cuz if the nuts were more expensive

681
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,848
Count for 4/4 50 in in mm 1X

682
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Expensive

683
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Yeah

684
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,712
I think everybody was worried about the price

685
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
And

686
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
They also they didn't like the bread I mean in the

687
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Hopper

688
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:24,256
The upper management of the company small company but the people they've been around for a while

689
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
It was sort of a

690
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,144
And this is why bread is and this is not rich so cap

691
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
So what we did is

692
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,288
It was actually a opportunity this was actually a project that

693
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
My nephew and I

694
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,384
This was our opportunity to build equity in a company

695
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,784
And that was really what my brother said he was he would always on 51%

696
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
But

697
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,160
He was going to give us an opportunity to buy into the company in the in order to buy in

698
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
We had to produce sales

699
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Sweetheart to increase revenues

700
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
CU Century Spanish

701
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
User created a separate company

702
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,984
To sell these are for the brand separate brand

703
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,056
And my nephew and myself we ran that

704
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,640
We ran the operation this is Glenn son show B

705
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:18,016
And then she'll be used like a prodigy kid you know really smart kid

706
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
Even graduated in three years magnacumlaude

Good University

710

In economics about the

He gets out he's 21 21 years old he gets

712
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
The same year I got out of prison he gets out of college

713
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
Walker and he had a whole different way of looking at things

714
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,104
And he really didn't like me be around but

715
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,712
We were partners and we managed to

716
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
To find ways to work together and

717
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
We had our own duties at waiver

718
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Riverdale for the most part in that kind of

719
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,720
Episode of each other's way you were the guy who came up with the actual

720
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Product you came up with Dave's Killer Bread

721
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
But

722
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
Let's let you serve reflecting the true moment

723
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
I mean

724
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
It's probably unlikely that

725
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,264
You know Dave's Killer Bread would have become a brand at this

726
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Point

727
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Without

728
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
Your brother and his son's business Act

729
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,736
Arbitration possible for that

730
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,320
Wake up first of all my dad starting what he did

731
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,160
You been on my dad was basically a knucklehead like me

732
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
I worked his butt off but he didn't really

733
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,096
Yeah I know he wasn't a businessman for saving his like that was his Focus he was creator

734
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,680
And he was a hard worker and that's what I see myself as

735
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,776
My brother and my nephew had more definitely had more of the

736
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
They were looking at the finances

737
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
All that stuff more than I was always

738
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Passion

739
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
And so

740
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,760
There was a lot of disagreements on how things should be done but

741
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Honestly

742
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
There were many times that because it it felt so bad

743
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
That way we the way we got on

744
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Dad

745
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
It almost derailed

746
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
And

747
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,352
What was so what was so hard about I mean I mean obviously

748
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
You know your side

749
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
Story but I mean

750
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
What was was it just a Personality Clash like

751
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Definitely

752
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,920
That was definitely the attitude that while this guy comes out here in these kind of a

753
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
A wrecking ball

754
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
Just got here just ladies I could Cowboys shoot from the hip

755
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,136
Downdraft the stuff he does fails and you know

756
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:38,048
You are crazy

757
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Did you guys founded this

758
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
Brandon 2005

759
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:46,496
Right and no one knew what Dave's Killer Bread was in 2005 no one is really going to know what it was for several more years

760
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
Welding

761
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,920
Attention to get attention was there tension between you and your brother and your nephew from the

762
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Beginning like even

763
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
I'm getting really

764
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Very very frightening

765
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Oh my God

766
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
And the way I always thought it was

767
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,952
People love my story they load what I gone through and how it overcome it

768
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
But my family

769
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,560
Was too close to it or something and didn't

770
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
That way

771
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,192
And they saw his more like well he doesn't deserve this

772
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
But I I went out and

773
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
I had a lot of love

774
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
From the

775
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,384
From the people in the community.

776
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,944
You talk like you're storing loose and look what I'm doing now

777
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,320
Yeah it was in the actually wrote my story put it on the back of the bag it was like a few paragraph

778
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,696
I've got in front of me it starts semi was a four-time loser before I realized I was in the wrong game

779
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,280
15 years in prison is Pretty Tough way to find oneself but I have no regrets

780
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
And it went on

781
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Describe

782
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Does Pratt University

783
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
They trying to make the world a better place one loaf of

784
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
Bread at a time

785
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,872
That must have been incredibly powerful for people to see that on the packaging and this is when you're still just selling at farmers

786
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Rockets ride

787
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Yeah and

788
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,504
I would sit there Tyrell standard Farmers Market

789
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
Passover bread

790
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
Do this doctor this attorney at law

791
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,392
Sweethome professional person and

792
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
People I never would have met

793
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
You know and I started meeting these great people and they loved the idea and you left the bread

794
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Pretty

795
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:19,424
Pretty soon after you launch did you did you put the cartoon like the caricature

796
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Have you on the on the

797
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,544
On the rapper yeah you know how that came about was my Wii

798
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,592
My brother my nephew and myself

799
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Sitting with you copyright attorney Mike

800
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
My type

801
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
He said it was bread great you know you got

802
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,856
Goodnight I think the name parade

803
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
You know what you're missing is a logo

804
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
My brother had been suggesting that we have

805
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
A picture of me on the back with my guitar at with my story

806
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
And I thought that was a good idea

807
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
But when I heard this guy talking about the

808
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
I said

809
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
I started sketching

810
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,848
And I ended up scratching the idea I had was

811
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
This guy

812
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Who represents me

813
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
With his guitar

814
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
And

815
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
Dave's bread in big block letters all this is

816
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
Painted on the wall on a brick wall

817
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Are and our

818
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
That somebody comes along with their

819
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
Red spray paint contacts killer over

820
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,936
And that doesn't ever show up that nobody ever gets that from looking at the

821
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
That what we ended up with

822
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
That was originally

823
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Oh yeah that's the killer now I see that that's the graffiti on the rug I got you okay

824
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
Logo is really hard

825
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,040
By the way I read an end and please be honest with me

826
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,368
Just was this level with me I read that you add on

827
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,976
I asked I rather you ask the cartoonist to make your biceps bigger in that cartoon

828
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
I said no I don't think about you

829
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,936
I need a bigger

830
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
Cuz they're they're definitely a little a little exaggerated

831
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,384
And they like the idea of calling a Dave's Killer Bread

832
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,992
They is no it's interesting thing we went to a marketing firm

833
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Tell the story this ex-con is Killer Bread

834
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Band

835
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
They're like now that's too risky

Allison hunt

837
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,792

839
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Very you know

840
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Number to happy about that but eventually I know that my brother and my nephew came around to the idea that

841
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,616
The killer bad idea and they're contacting which was going to be acceptable

842
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
You know this marketing firm is full of crap

843
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,112
Let me come back at Dave and his family take their Killer Bread from the farmers market to the supermarket

844
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648

Welcome back to how I built this from NPR guy Raz so into that

889
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
5 Dave's Killer Bread is getting more popular the lobes are selling their media attention

890
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
And people love the story of Dave dalby ex-con turned his life around with bread but

891
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
To this point he's just been selling the Lowe's at the farmers market and that's just a seasonal thing

892
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
As the market was coming to a close around November ish before like or how you going to hell

893
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
Are we going to have this bread

894
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
And

895
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
Nebraska

896
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,896
Tell your local stores don't stores you buy it tell them you want the bread there and they didn't taste

897
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,760
Started and we got into one small Coop and we got into one vegan grocery

898
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,856
And then in a couple more months we got into New Seasons which was like

899
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
First big

900
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Big Break

901
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
But it was

902
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Boyle's Law

903
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
A lot of work doing all those demos

904
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Oh my God

905
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
I think so

906
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
You launch this

907
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Your brother and your nephew

908
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,240
It's got about 30 employees obviously you're sort of a side project

909
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Of nature bag

910
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Make it right I got time this

911
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
At that time

912
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
It may not be so fast but look when you should look back on it

913
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Like

914
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Within

915
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
I think five years

916
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
You have $190

917
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Employees

918
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Working for you what

919
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
What was the turning point do you remember what when it just started

920
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Blow up

921
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
We were at a small okay we had a 15000 square foot facility that was making nature baked when I

922
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
I got out of prison

923
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Within a very short time we outgrew that

924
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
And

925
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,056
We had to find time on the floor to We Are

926
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
Where to share our time

927
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
With nature bake production and we are totally different cruise and they're actually kind of that each other's throats kind of like my

928
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,320
My brother and my right hand

929
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
We moved out of there I don't know how many

930
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,000
Employees who probably at a hundred plays or so it might I don't think we even had a hundred of the time you probably 50

931
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
When we moved out of the

932
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,376
Add to Bob's Red Mill sold facility

933
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,240
We know Bob's Reverend I could we go back a long way without Bobby's Valley show

934
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
That I know I got her one episode and I enjoyed it

935
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
And Bob is great he's a wonderful guy in fact

936
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
My dad

937
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Was Bob's first

938
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
A holy flower

939
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
Wholesale custom

940
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:04,671
So you guys move until you move into an old Bob's Red Mill facility to expand production of

941
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Of Dave's Killer Bread

942
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
Yeah and

943
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,279
The biggest challenge we had at this point

944
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
2007-8 I can't remember

945
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
My brother needed to get

946
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,727
I didn't have any credit I didn't have anything

947
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Sure sure

948
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,079
Martin Museum Showbiz young and didn't have anything

949
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Established

950
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
So

951
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
Glenn have to go to the bank put up his house

952
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
Couldn't get our regular Bank

953
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
You're one of the biggest banks in the country

954
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
Wouldn't take a chance on me

955
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
Yeah so we had to get a local bank who was willing to it'll take that chance in Philly High retire

956
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Interest rate

957
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,423
Riccottis a million-and-a-half to move to this new facility in a million 1/2 to us then was

958
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
A lot of money insurance

959
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,519
And there was no cash for support.

960
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Ratings are based on future

961
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,895
So he put up a basic mortgage

962
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
Take out second mortgage or line Credit against his house

963
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,807
If you love The bit right to get some Capital to fund the business

964
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
Yanez house wasn't enough to

965
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
Burton collateralized

966
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Dial.

967
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
They have to take a chance on

968
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
And everything maybe they would have owned everything

969
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
We have made it

970
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:20,191
So how are you able to to get any equity in the company if you had no

971
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
No cash like how are you able to

972
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
Get any ownership over this

973
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:29,151
Benjamin my brother sold it to us for our percentage of the valuation of the business

974
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,199
At the time that we started our project

975
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
Right and instead of owning a certain a larger percentage of Dave's Killer Bread I settled on a small

976
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Entire company of nature

977
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Yes

978
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
And I'm very glad

979
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
So-and-so had you guys

980
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
Continue to to expand like

981
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Check into

982
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
Bigger chance

983
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Costco at how did you do that

984
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
What Costco

985
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,335
I would get this letter this I got this email from somebody at Costco and buyer

986
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Chain

987
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Our customers are asking for your bread

988
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,247
And we would like you you're come up and present to us

989
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Well

990
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
We were still at

991
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
The old facility

992
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
15000 square feet

993
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,719
And absolutely no way we are going to be able to have a Costco

994
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
But the fact that we

995
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,863
Add Costco coming with a big factor in how we got

996
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
Actually executing the idea was a whole nother matter

997
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
It took us a long time to

998
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
Finally reach a deal and finally have the

999
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,943
Ability to produce enough bread to meet gospel demand

1000
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,295
And we just kept working and working and working and promoting and

1001
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
We're able to secure

1002
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
Partners in Commack

1003
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
Co Manufacturing

1004
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
I sent the other other

1005
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Facilities at 1

1006
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Bake your recipe

1007
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Be to your specification

1008
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
Cuz you couldn't possibly have done that

1009
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
All on your own for Costco right

1010
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Does the scale was going to know if possible

1011
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,287
I know and I'll tell you what man when you have a cold shower of a product

1012
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
Trying to get another culture II

1013
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Adopt it

1014
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
Is a hole

1015
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Is a whole nother challenge

1016
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Create

1017
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
That product

1018
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
Have consistent quality

1019
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Weather reel

1020
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Was a real bear

1021
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
I would

1022
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
Go and see the operation surprise them

1023
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
And I was very

1024
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
I'm pleasantly surprised myself sometimes Suunto

1025
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
We were able to get it right

1026
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
Button people

1027
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
People will cut Corners when they get a chance

1028
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
And so we

1029
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,127
Did work our asses off to make sure that that didn't happen

1030
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
To Costco I mean the Costco deal

1031
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Clearly transformation

1032
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
Because you had to scale up fast

1033
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,575
Increase number of employees and it was going to

1034
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Create huge

1035
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
Remy stream huge windfall

1036
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
At a certain point

1037
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
About a third of your Workforce

1038
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
So now you're getting close to

1039
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
The 300 people

1040
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,887
We're ex-cons like was that was that a hint

1041
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:02,239
Was it deliberate thing like that you think are hiring other ex-convicts

1042
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,567
To work because it's really hard to get a job when you've got

1043
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
A record made from your desk on

1044
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
It was special then it's

1045
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Got a little better now

1046
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:19,135
You know I had a certain mentality about that that came from my own experience of having Transformer

1047
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
I like I was like

1048
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
You know this is something this is a real thing

1049
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
People do change and when they're ready

1050
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,399
How great would it be to give them that opportunity and then we get an amazing play

1051
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,495
So it just made sense to hire some of that

1052
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
But that wasn't something weird

1053
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
Hannah Wednesday

1054
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
Once once they're temporary services in that's how we

1055
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,015
McGregor people generally share once they found out

1056
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:51,647
Dad we were felon friendly it was funny. All they sent us

1057
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
We were hiring so fast

1058
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
Dad are we ended up hiring a lot more felons

1059
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,839
And it just worked out

1060
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
I think around

1061
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
I think it was like 2011

1062
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,263
2012 Yukon O2 in like 40

1063
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
15 million dollars

1064
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Selfridge

1065
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Which is phenomenal

1066
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,455
And I guess I guess around a time you you get an offer from

1067
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
The private Equity company

1068
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Dubai in

1069
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
And I bought out

1070
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,855
The Catholic company in 2012

1071
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
Exactly how I feel

1072
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
But I think around this time like the relationship between you and your brother and your nephew is so bad that at times you guys were little

1073
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
Emailing each other in the same office

1074
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
Which from an outside perspective

1075
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
Just seem so

1076
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
Sad like a

1077
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
I think people would say what Kaiser

1078
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
You're so successful like

1079
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
Protestant so great

1080
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
Hiring ex convicts

1081
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
Are you seriously not getting along like

1082
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
It just seems so

1083
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,319
Weird but then of course family Dynamics are complicated

1084
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
They are

1085
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
Yeah I don't even know how to explain it I

1086
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,815
But we did have it you know this is why is this thing we ever did

1087
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
And I think this

1088
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
Was Predator my brother

1089
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,215
That we got someone

1090
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
That could

1091
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
If Isis is guy was actually a family business advisor but mainly menu for succession plans for things like that

1092
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
Right but he said

1093
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,735
You guys need a vision and a mission

1094
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
You guys have it but you don't all agree on what it is

1095
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
And

1096
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
He was right

1097
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
And once we got those established

1098
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
And they're pretty simple

1099
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
Like one of them like to Visionworks

1100
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
Make the world a better place one loaf of bread the time

1101
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
So I was

1102
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Gratifying

1103
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
They agreed to that

1104
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
And so we were able to

1105
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Solve some of our problems and get along and

1106
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Be in the same room

1107
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Cu

1108
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,503
I mean pretty quickly and I guess by this point 2012 you

1109
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,807
You became famous like you are the

1110
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,599
What does caricature on the bread

1111
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,695
People want to know your story you're doing media you're speaking

1112
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
How do you feel about that did you did you love that attention

1113
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:10,399
I did because it was for a good reason I felt I always felt like I was doing

1114
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
Good work

1115
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
You know

1116
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,263
Like there was a purpose in for the first time in my life I had to

1117
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Purpose

1118
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
It was just

1119
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Unbelievable

1120
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:23,711
What was happening in love I was getting and I really couldn't keep up with demand for speaking

1121
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
But I never

1122
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Had a prepared speech

1123
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
You know

1124
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,647
I was just so out then like.

1125
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
2

1126
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
As You Are

1127
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,743
As your profile was

1128
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
Growing

1129
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,375
Do you think that it had an I mean I must have had an impact on your own

1130
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:48,031
Eagle races naturally it would have normally the more attention you get the more people hanging out the more people telling your amazing the more people

1131
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
You're awesome you're great all day visit like

1132
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
You probably can't inflate

1133
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Yuri get right

1134
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:58,271
And I tried you know the thing that helped me so much with my transformation in life

1135
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
The two things were acceptance and humility

1136
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,719
Yeah and so when this was happening I was always telling myself look you know I'm very fortunate

1137
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
Blessed and grateful for this

1138
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
I was always trying to tell myself

1139
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Stop that

1140
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
And

1141
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
Unfortunately

1142
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,447
You know I took my first vacation a few years hence

1143
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
Went to Mexico

1144
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
And

1145
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
I discovered tequila

1146
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
And

1147
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:29,247
It took me years for it to have to graduate to a level where I was really an alcoholic full-blown alcoholic

1148
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
But you were drinking all that all along White even after

1149
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
You got a prison

1150
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
A beer or two here and there

1151
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
The other people would get wasted

1152
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:45,119
It was until things got easier. Easier and I have more employees during my working

1153
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:50,239
Eventually it was easier to drink and just be a drinker and

1154
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,127
Milo, successful I'm kind of a rockstar see there you go there's that bad creeping reunion

1155
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:02,527
And so I can afford to do this and I even would call myself tozzi of bread you know

1156
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,343
Apple speak to a group of kids like that

1157
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,695
High school or whatever and then right afterwards. Celebrate by

1158
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
Drinking 1/2

1159
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,679
And then I drink the other half later and you know and then eventually it was a half gallon

1160
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,239
2013

1161
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
I think it's safe to say was a pretty

1162
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
Rough year for you to attack

1163
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
That happened that year

1164
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,479
Do the moment that year where you were

1165
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Outside of the

1166
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,599
Cover story of Dave's Killer Bread of the facility in Portland in

1167
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Maybe you were

1168
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
You're drunk or you are having

1169
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
Mannequin

1170
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,511
I had drank for several weeks at that point I'd

1171
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
I showed up that day

1172
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,191
I had decided that day that I was going to

1173
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,287
Go against the new CEOs mandate that I was not supposed to

1174
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
On the property

1175
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
I was very rude

1176
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,991
About this and watch on a property because they thought you were disruptive at that point

1177
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Yeah they

1178
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
They just

1179
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
Well

1180
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
One of the things that happened was

1181
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Before this

1182
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,231
Iodine up to my cabin. I just cabin on Mount Hood

1183
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
And

1184
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,327
I taking some guys with me and one of the people

1185
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,119
One of the guy that took with me I shouldn't

1186
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,447
Original buddy there was

1187
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
That we were Joe Patti's way back in the day

1188
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,359
Replica cabin long story short he leaves

1189
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
He left in your car right there my car

1190
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
And I let him

1191
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,759
Yeah I was like you stole it Irish

1192
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,807
I was too drunk to even

1193
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
Use my

1194
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Lose my head

1195
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
And

1196
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
This guy ends up

1197
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,535
They find him in a ditch 40 some-odd Days Later

1198
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Decomposing

1199
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,863
It's really everything in

1200
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
Yeah company

1201
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
First of all

1202
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Said well you need to get an attorney

1203
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
And

1204
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
They started

1205
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Been out of control

1206
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
They must have been worried because

1207
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Four Seasons first of all

1208
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
You're implicated

1209
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,807
Whether you know not directly but indirectly in this guy's des and

1210
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,159
And you are the brand you are Dave you are David kind of distracted and

1211
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
And there there was horrible

1212
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,279
Yeah and honestly you know when that guy died

1213
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
I was heartbroken too

1214
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
You know

1215
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Yan final aeon

1216
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
November 14th I believe was

1217
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,775
I have been not drinking for

1218
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,847
68 weeks I got I don't know for sure

1219
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,943
I was getting more and more resentful and

1220
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:45,599
There was there was becoming a clash between me and the company and hear this company that I work so hard

1221
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Gillibrand

1222
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,719
So I'm feeling this loss and losing my company

1223
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Losing my grandmother

1224
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Baby

1225
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,351
And one things leading to another and finally

1226
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
That day I showed up at bred quarter

1227
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,007
And I'm not quite your level

1228
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,359
I see this cardboard cutout of myself

1229
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
And without actually forming the thought in my mind what I was thinking what I was feeling was like this

1230
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Sky

1231
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,855
This cardboard cutout of me and be here in this

1232
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,903
In the storefront and I can't

1233
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,951
Enchilada pasta

1234
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,767
I never liked it anyway so I punched it

1235
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,839
And it didn't make any sense none of it makes any sense

1236
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
But at the time

1237
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,959
I realize that's you know it was just resentment

1238
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,799
And the day just got worse from there

1239
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
Yeah I mean it

1240
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
It got a lot worse like

1241
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
Like you ended up

1242
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
I think later that night

1243
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
You ended up a ramming your your SUV into

1244
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,319
Two cop cars

1245
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,599
And you were right

1246
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
I went to jail

1247
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
For like 36 hours

1248
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,767
And I was seeing all this stuff about me on TV

1249
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,327
And I wasn't you know I was freaky

1250
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,655
But my attorney tells me

1251
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Look dude

1252
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
You have to check in

1253
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
To Cedar Hills Hospital

1254
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Palmetto Hospital

1255
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
Because you're not quite right

1256
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Eventually

1257
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,735
I did follow his advice went there and checked in

1258
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
And stay there

1259
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
For like

1260
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
Two and a half weeks and it was a good move

1261
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,463
So this is now the beginning of the next

1262
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Episode of your rebirth

1263
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Because

1264
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,119
It already had that reverse in 2001 in prison that

1265
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
And you kind of

1266
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
Amazing

1267
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,495
Run of success

1268
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
And then

1269
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
Really hard

1270
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Yeah

1271
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:47,199
You know after that two and a half weeks in the hospital where and which I was very

1272
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
Hypomanic and just like

1273
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,551
Laughing joking knucklehead

1274
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
I was back in my home

1275
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
I hit the bottom I had the biggest

1276
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:03,839
The most painful bottom I've ever hit and it was after I read this story about myself in the Willamette Week

1277
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,399
Breaking bread which was reading bad

1278
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Sure

1279
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
And

1280
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
I

1281
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,103
Got rid of thought well that's funny breaking Brad Hendricks with the Breaking Bad logo and I got

1282
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
That's cool when I'm still in a good frame of mind and then

1283
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
I would say a good friend of mine but she just happy

1284
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:26,367
Until I read that article and it was the worst thing I've ever seen about myself

1285
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
I just hit me that

1286
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
Wow I have

1287
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Hybrid

1288
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
I'm a big

1289
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,607
Problem I am Eatery I'm something really good or I'm

1290
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,167
Something really bad and I'm really bad

1291
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,495
And look what I've done I've let down all these people

1292
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Always employees

1293
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
All these investors

1294
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,407
All these your people who believed in me

1295
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
And

1296
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
I just couldn't live with that

1297
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
It just hit me so hard

1298
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Panda

1299
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
It took me awhile to come out of that depression

1300
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
I mean it really speaks to this idea that

1301
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Cuz at this point

1302
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
You already had some money like

1303
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
You were clearly going to

1304
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
Become a wealthy man

1305
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,399
And it was already welcomed at this

1306
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
And we sold the first half of the business

1307
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,519
Made it speaks to this idea that

1308
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,823
Money doesn't solve

1309
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
Everything in oftentimes can can exacerbate

1310
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
Things right it's like

1311
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,759
Cast from the outside somebody might say

1312
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Your life

1313
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:32,927
How did the right and you're saying but you can't understand cuz I can

1314
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Can't even understand

1315
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
You couldn't I couldn't explain to your cell phone

1316
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
No it's a it's a

1317
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,119
It's Unique

1318
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
And

1319
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,447
Over the moon shatter circumcised

1320
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Yeah

1321
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,799
Money has nothing to do with happiness

1322
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:55,711
Never never has I knew that from the beginning because I was so happy without ever making any money

1323
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,271
I am used to having money now

1324
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
So I would hate to be without it

1325
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
But

1326
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Really

1327
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,159
Things are good because

1328
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,695
I'm good you in my space

1329
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,791
At that point after you history hit that low did you decide

1330
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,095
To do alcoholics anonymous

1331
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,655
They had to say you really have to do the writing

1332
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,215
I didn't really have a choice I've liked

1333
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,495
Alcoholics Anonymous

1334
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,543
Yuan the 12 steps are just great

1335
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Very meaningful

1336
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
I probably go anyway this point but

1337
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Something I have to do

1338
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,807
Is a struggle for you everyday

1339
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
To avoid alcohol

1340
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
It has been a time

1341
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,159
But not been quite a while

1342
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
One of the things that I have some insurance policy and I

1343
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
I believe it helps his

1344
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Vivitrol

1345
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,447
That's the brand name of this thing that's kind of very modern antabuse

1346
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
Did you take a shot

1347
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
I just shot every month

1348
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,871
What what is a medication that that's Roblox inhibits

1349
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:02,527
Not supposed to enjoy you would really enjoy yourself on it if you get a sword girl why

1350
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Why screw around with it

1351
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,135
When it's not even going to be a good experience

1352
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,951
That's a very good attorney

1353
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,023
So you are

1354
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,071
Right now

1355
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
At this point in your life

1356
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,703
In recovery still and really working at it the company

1357
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Seoul

1358
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
Entirely sold Dave's Killer Bread

1359
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
No longer owned by the family of the

1360
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Get sold for

1361
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,431
Almost 300 billion dollars and you

1362
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
275

1363
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:38,623
I'm your nephew Shelby went on to do other Ventures and he's involved in investing you've got

1364
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
An art gallery in Portland

1365
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,231
What's your relationship like

1366
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
With your brother Glenn and

1367
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Internet future hubby

1368
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
Well it's

1369
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
It's in limbo I guess

1370
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
I haven't

1371
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,799
I would like to think that someday we will

1372
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
Do more family than just like

1373
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,383
Former business partners

1374
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
It's not it we just don't talk

1375
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,319
Sometimes we have family gatherings that have nothing to do with

1376
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,159
They're not put on by any of us and we might meet meet up there

1377
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,719
But what I want to do

1378
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,791
This is weird I'm telling you this instead of that I'm but

1379
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,351
I just want something

1380
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
Real real

1381
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
What happened you know I don't want

1382
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
I don't want to

1383
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,727
Force anything in

1384
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
I just hope I just hope to have

1385
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,103
At the end of this before we all die

1386
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,175
Ditto sexy my brother and myself

1387
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,015
Now that we're going to find something some peace

1388
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
You know

1389
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
When you think about

1390
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,647
How do you think about your story is amazing

1391
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,951
Maria Dobson the downs and the

1392
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,303
And all that you've been through which I think a lot of people could identify with because

1393
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
This is not a seamless

1394
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,935
This is not a simple story of going from one success to

1395
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
Another success like

1396
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Keypad

1397
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,287
You have a lot of ups and downs and you

1398
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
And you're open about in your honesty

1399
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
Super Soul thank you

1400
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,687
I realize the power of

1401
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,271
I realized it really early on

1402
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,575
That a lot of people care about the story

1403
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,415
And they would have been for the bread the story by wouldn't matter that much

1404
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
Anyway it feels good to talk about

1405
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,815
How much of what happened to you I mean the success of a

1406
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,119
The good sides of

1407
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,191
Do you think more because of

1408
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:33,567
Your hard work and your intelligence and your skill and how much of it do you think is

1409
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,103
Is because of locking and

1410
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
The luck that you know

1411
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,943
Shobie and Glenn were there too

1412
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Take a note

1413
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
Sorcier in that product a

1414
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Potential

1415
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Samantha Testa

1416
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Ebag

1417
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Yeah

1418
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,231
Lot of bad luck before we good looking

1419
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:56,351
When it comes to being a millionaire and becoming very successful businessman

1420
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,167
That is not something that

1421
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,471
Would have happened probably without

1422
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
You don't have any nose associations

1423
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,823
But who knows where we're going to see tonight

1424
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
The most demiracle evolved

1425
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
This was the transformation I had in prison

1426
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
That was What mattered

1427
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,271
Because my mind was

1428
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
Free I felt free

1429
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
And

1430
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,183
We're having the contrast between the adversity that I've had my

1431
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,487
And what I was going through

1432
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,303
And I mean just being able to create and

1433
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
Just keep working towards something

1434
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
You know

1435
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
That was that was the miracle

1436
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,983
That's Dave Dahl

1437
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Co-founder

1438
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Dave's Killer Bread

1439
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,383
How do I get the cartoon version of Dave is still on every package

1440
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Get the bread

1441
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
Biceps as big as ever

1442
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,271
Dave no longer has a mustache that's in the package but

1443
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,879
Play his guitar band name

1444
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
Dave Dahl and the killer granddaddies

1445
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487

Taking on screen time

1463
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,991
One of the big things were working on right now is the concept of resilience

1464
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
And not quitting what's up

1465
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,599
It's hard sometimes you lose and lose and loose

Hey thanks so much for sticking around.

1473
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:12,031
For how you built that a story starts with

1474
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
A recipe

1475
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,895
Black pepper essential oil in Caleb OTC Buckthorn

Seasalt clothes Capricorn arrowroot elderflower

1478
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
Go into a natural deodorant

1479
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,303
That Jason and Erica make and sell is called Hit liquor

1480
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,447
Emphasis on the liquor vodka whiskey whiskey

1481
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:45,055
Key ingredients in pit liquor deodorant because like most spirits

1482
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,895
They can actually kill the bacteria that make us smell bad

1483
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
But beyond that whiskey has cannons in it which are antibacterial in and of themselves

1484
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:01,695
And then it's something that's fun anyway all this came about a few years ago when Erika was pregnant

1485
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
She was looking for a natural deodorant that would work without making her break out and so Jason

1486
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
And decided to see if

1487
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
He can make some

1488
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,447
Even though he had absolutely no it's

1489
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
Experience in deodorant like

1490
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
His day job

1491
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:21,919
With an it I actually spend a lot of time reading textbooks on deodorant

1492
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
And on armpit

1493
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:27,551
Old textbooks yes there are actually textbooks Unturned

1494
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,879
To alter out 2016

1495
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
Jason was trying to find the

1496
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,231
Perfect Blend to fight Bo

1497
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,559
Mixing vodka whiskey and essential oils

1498
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,583
Black teeth

1499
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,423
And then storing these concoctions in mason jars around the house

1500
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
He tested all of them out

1501
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
On Erica

1502
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,567
He stopped showering his armpits he stopped watching the

1503
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
Wood

1504
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Come to me

1505
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,271
And say I Street st. John's wort and vodka on this armpit and I have juniper berries and

1506
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
This weird tea from China

1507
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:05,183
On this other armpit I want you to smell him and tell me which smells better and can I just say hear that

1508
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:09,279
Imma show we talked to a lot of Founders were also married couples

1509
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,559
But this

1510
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:16,703
This is like a whole new level of collaboration if you've ever stuck your nose in an armpit you don't have good eggs

1511
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,471
Vacation

1512
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,007
And I finally got

1513
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
Sick of smelling

1514
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,567
The book I think you have a winner

1515
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,127
Please stop I'm done I'm tired

1516
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,199
And it turns out Jason really did have a winner

1517
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:31,039
A mix of tea and vodka and whiskey and essential oils

1518
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,855
That works really well for him and Erica

1519
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
But what about everybody else

1520
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,927
So we

1521
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:42,559
Reached out to her friends on Facebook and said hey anyone want to try a natural deodorant that we formulated

1522
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
Can their friends signed up

1523
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,911
They tried it they liked it words

1524
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
The spread and

1525
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
American Jason kicked it into high gear

1526
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,591
They raised a little bit of money and they've started to ramp up production of the deodorant

1527
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
But then

1528
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Customers

1529
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,479
Complain about something the couple had not anticipated

1530
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,015
They were really angry with

1531
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
He's white spray caps that we had

1532
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Like people

1533
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
We're telling us that when they sprayed the cap

1534
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
The alcohol was

1535
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
Viewing up around their finger

1536
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
In like a fountain Italy

1537
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Looks like Old Faithful

1538
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,351
So are kind json tried different

1539
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
Cat's butt

1540
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
The captain claw game

1541
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,495
It basically lead us to a place where we're sending out free cats

1542
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,799
Three bottles of deodorant new bottles

1543
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103
And we just we basically just Hemorrhage money

1544
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
After a frantic search

1545
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,967
Erica Jason eventually found a cat that was

1546
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Sturdy enough

1547
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,271
Deliver the deodorant

1548
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
Set the bottle cap prices

1549
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
Almost

1550
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
The company

1551
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,415
It seems like it's almost like falling down Alice's

1552
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Side rabbit hole

1553
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
In Alice in Wonderland

1554
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511
Is it's just so incredibly d

1555
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,327
And there's so much to do it's scary

1556
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
Terrifying but the bottom line is it's

1557
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:54,239
The blast pit liquor is now averaging about $20,000 a month

1558
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Sales

1559
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,335
And the company hopes to be profitable by this summer

1560
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
And by the way

1561
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
Some of the folks in our team have

1562
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,943
Actually sampled the deodorant and

1563
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,271
They say it works and smells pretty great

1564
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
Very clean neighborhood bar but

1565
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
To be clear

1566
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
It is not drinkable

1567
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
So don't drink it

1568
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
For the same reason nobody

1569
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,999
Drinks are hand sanitizer nobody should drink

1570
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
Cody should drink 3002

1571
