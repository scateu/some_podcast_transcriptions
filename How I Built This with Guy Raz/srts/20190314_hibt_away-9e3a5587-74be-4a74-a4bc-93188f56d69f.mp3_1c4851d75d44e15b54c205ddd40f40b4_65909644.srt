Perfect pear

11
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Before Christmas got a lot of press cell

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
But we found out when we placed our order that there was no way that our bag would be ready be

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't know why it was so surprising to us we're like what do you mean like we have this time

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
And it said that if we ordered the bags by August would have them for the holidays

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Someone had said that we had to stop doing that

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,504
NPR how I built this

17

Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movement they built

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
I got a broken suitcase inspired

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Rubio to design a better one disrupt the multibillion-dollar luggage

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Instagrammable suitcase

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Away

22
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
Standing at the baggage carousel at

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
At the airport

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Waiting for your bag to come around

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,600
The never-ending parade of black suitcases going by

26
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:35,488
And every now and then the person next to you rushes to grab one of those bags only to realize

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
It's not actually hers

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Who's a pretty common scenario

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Because a lot of people

30
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Suitcases

31
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
Just the thing you shovel your stuff into when you go on a trip

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,568
450 bucks at TJ Maxx or on Amazon

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
And most of the time

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
You shove into a closet or under your bed

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Between trips

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Probably only last

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
A few years before the zipper breaks

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
The handle falls off

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
And most of us have always accepted that that's

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Just the way it is right

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Well Jen Rubio

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
And back in 2015 she had a hunch that other people might

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,936
Needed help mid-range suitcases were designed they

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Boring and uninspired

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
She wanted something that would last

46
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
A long time and

47
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Create a bag

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
That would be I catching something

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
You want to show off at the airport

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Approached a friend named Steph Curry

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Who worked with her at Warby Parker

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
And the result of that partnership is away

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
It's a line of sleek suitcases that come in tons of colors like rose gold or violet or

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Sky blue

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Perks like a built-in phone charger

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
Kind of bag you want to Instagram poll you travel the world

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,848
Indians own story of traveling the world it started when she was a kid in the Philippines

58
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,688
Your mom was a dentist and her dad was a business professor there

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
Until one day when Jen found out that their lives

60
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
We're about to change

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
Remember when I was 7 years old

62
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,464
My parents told me that me and my brother and my mom were moving to

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
To the US

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
And we've never been and we are so excited

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,168
And they told us stories about how in the US it's

66
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
And we went to

67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
It is giant mall in Manila

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
And bought snowsuits

69
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
Had a penguin and my little brother had a blue one

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
And a reward them on the plane since May 1st

71
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Big big fight with my mom my dad stayed behind cuz he didn't have a Visa yet and we were snowsuit

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
Remember to speak very sweaty on the plane

73
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
And this was like

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
I don't know

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,120
Late September on the plane to to the USB insisted

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Found it

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
And we land at Newark Airport in Lake September

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,360
Sweltering was super hot and that was the first time I'd ever

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
Really experienced true disappointment

80
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Why did you guys

81
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,112
Would you do know what the reason was it was it just like new opportunities her or what

82
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
Yeah that's a good question I mean read a great life

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
In the Philippines

84
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
As far as I remember

85
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
But

86
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
It was presented to us a very

87
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Exciting

88
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,191
Opportunity that not a lot of people got we had

89
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
A couple of aunts and uncles who already lived

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
On the east coast and we were going to join them and

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
We never even met these ants

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
We are super excited about

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
Obviously looking back now is just

94
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
For my parents to

95
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,575
To continue to grow and have more opportunities to develop their careers and

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
And give a better life

97
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
10 to us

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
Jen's dad was able to join the family

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
New Jersey

100
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Her mom opened up a dentist office

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
And her dad

102
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
Started to settle into a new life

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
In America

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
Did you put the kid that you like or you immersed in Filipino culture or

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
I think

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
Interlock two different experiences of immigrants

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,111
Kids and they're the ones who embrace it and they're the ones like me who are

108
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Immensely embarrassed of of these

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
Periods and I think it had a lot to do with

110
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
You know the other kids

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
School or like wanting to fit in

112
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Orbitz

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
No I I only spoke English I would like

114
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
Get mad at my parents when they would cook Filipino food because it would make like

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
My school jacket

116
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
I smell like food

117
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
And I was just

118
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
I don't know I was like as a kid and I just so embarrassed of the whole thing

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
It'll come to terms of that until you're

120
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Like cold early 20

121
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
When you start to kind of realize

122
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
Is that it's a hugely Rich part of

123
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
Yeah and it's so valuable and and it's so important and I just

124
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
I advise that you know play the first

125
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
10 years

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
In the USA just like being embarrassed

127
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Abby Filipino

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
That was a pretty good student to high school

129
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,943
Despite that she says being more interested in being cool

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
I'm doing well in her classes

131
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
What time do the college

132
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
He chose Penn State

133
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
It was like TV College

134
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Public College in the movies

135
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
Nerf football game and there are

136
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Hunza people

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Colors

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Like a qua. I know that's normal and every

139
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Best but it was just like all of the

140
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
College things you saw in movie

141
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
And I was like this is amazing

142
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
And I

143
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Pics of major

144
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Cold Supply Chain

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
It was like

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
Begin the orientation day it said

147
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
You know they're one of

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
A handful of schools in the US offering supply chain as a major and I was like

149
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Cool

150
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Exclusive

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
I chose not to study

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
So you're doing like

153
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
You're in college

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
And

155
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,911
I guess you decided that you just at a certain point

156
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
You

157
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Opportunity

158
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
I meant that you didn't

159
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Go back

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Call it's like what what happened

161
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Yes so I was on

162
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
I think a bunch of classes

163
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,295
In a business school and they had at Penn State was called a co-op program which is you take a semester off

164
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
And you work for six month

165
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
At a company

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,975
And I was hating school and I was hating going to classes

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Taking the test

168
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Actually having to apply

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Myself

170
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
So I read about this program

171
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
And I was like

172
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Kulyuk

173
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
You got credit so you don't have to go to school

174
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
And I decide

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
To do it and I was place

176
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Stat

177
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Johnson & Johnson in

178
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Show me New Jersey

179
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
And I remember getting there on the first day

180
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
And

181
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
It's on

182
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
Huge company and this is their headquarters

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
And

184
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
They told us something

185
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Mind blowing on the 1st

186
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
140000 people work here

187
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
And I just couldn't

188
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Wrap my head around that number

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
I can remember I kept trying to relate it back

190
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
2

191
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
It's like the Penn State football stadium

192
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
And how many people could

193
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Fit in there

194
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,055
And I was I was just enamored with the whole thing I like I got a cubicle

195
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
And I got an ID badge

196
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,991
And I had my own desk in my own phone number and my own email and an email signature

197
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
And just the idea of

198
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
Work and being

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Like a business lady

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Was so exciting to

201
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Me and I just never wanted

202
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
But I had to sew it it ended

203
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
I had to go back

204
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
I first semester and I was

205
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
So miserable I had

206
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
I had felt like

207
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
And you what was out there

208
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
I knew it was like to work

209
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
This whole like

210
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
Corporate world existed and it was like

211
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
Thrilling to me and I wanted to be a part of it

212
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
So after a semester baggage

213
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
High School

214
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
I got another Co-op

215
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
And this time I got placed at Neutrogena

216
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Which is also owned by Johnson

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Datsun in LA

218
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
And I asked them to extend it

219
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
4

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Summer internship and then I asked

221
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Extend it into another thing I just

222
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Back to style

223
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Fathoms

224
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Going back to school

225
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
And

226
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
I don't know how I did it but they

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
They let me stay

228
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
And they made me

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
I promised that I would take the rest of my credits

230
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Online

231
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
And that I would finish and get my degree

232
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
And I never did

233
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
And they offered you a job

234
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Yeah and I and I base it was just like

235
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
The intern who never laugh

236
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,975
And I was invited to walk at graduation but I think I'm so

237
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
So you you're insecure

238
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Technically a College Dropout

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Yacht Technic

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,495
Yeah I think I think people are like oh cool your College Dropout might not like drop out of college so I can

241
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
So I could work in a cubicle

242
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
2006

243
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,991
2007 year in early 20s living in LA

244
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,599
You're working for a Neutrogena and that that was your plan

245
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,487
Yeah so I was working at a church and one woman that I really admired and that

246
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
I have never spoken to her personally but

247
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
I just remember recalling like every time she sent an email like everyone would open it and everyone would

248
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,359
Read her analyst reports all the time and every time she spoke with people with people with listen and she ran marketing

249
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,967
And I was talking to kind of my mentor about her and I was like okay how do I get a job

250
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
It marketing So This Woman's like

251
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Oh well to work in marketing care uni

252
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
Need to get an MBA

253
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
And me being me

254
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
Think to myself oh I should finish and get my

255
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
My undergrad degree so I can go get an MBA I would like there must be some way around that

256
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
But now exist

257
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
It opened up the

258
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
This whole new world to me

259
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
Of being able to work in marketing which to me at the time meant that you could control how

260
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
How people

261
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
Found out about your product

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
And how you could take everything that people were saying about it and maybe change the products and I just thought it was so cool

263
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
And I knew I really wanted to do it

264
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
And that if I couldn't do it there I would find

265
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Somewhere else that would let me do it

266
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
So I quit

267
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,567
And did you have a job or did you did you think okay I'm going to figure this out I'm going to

268
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Try and do marketing for

269
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
People and

270
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Just

271
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Figure it out

272
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Yeah

273
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
I need to do marketing I quit

274
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
And I didn't have a job

275
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
And I don't have a degree

276
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
And I didn't have that much money

277
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
But I had

278
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
That platform Tumblr

279
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Yeah Usher

280
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
So Tumblr

281
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,119
I guess maybe just started and I was like one of the early people on it

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,959
And it wouldn't make it off I would do in my spare time I would like to write on my Tumblr blog

283
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
And I had met a few

284
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
People in LA on Tumblr

285
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
One of the guys I met

286
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
You know did social media

287
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Add

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
YouTube social media

289
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Other job like I had my space eye Tumblr

290
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
I had Twitter and I

291
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
I didn't know that you could

292
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Do that and also that it was part of marketing

293
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
But he would do

294
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,791
He would use social media for some of like the OG food truck

295
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
In LA

296
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
He would like to eat like

297
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
Control their Twitter or whatever Facebook with whatever was around at that

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
So it's so wild it was literally Twitter and

299
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
Doing social media for food truck MetLife

300
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
You would just tweet where the truck was going to be

301
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,527
Which sounds so crazy now. That was some of the job but I remember like following the Twitter account

302
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
Finding out that the truck was going to be like

303
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
On the corner of these streets in La driving over there

304
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
There be hundreds of

305
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Well there

306
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
And I don't know why but it just

307
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Blew my mind

308
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
You can just tell me where you are

309
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
My people will come

310
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
And that's

311
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
But those are business

312
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
Otherwise like the truck would have just sat somewhere and you had to maybe drive

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Buy it

314
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
And I think it was like this is marketing

315
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,015
Like this is how you get paid to do marketing and do social media and these are all things I was interested in

316
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
I got this I'm figuring this out so

317
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
I started being like a freelancing filter

318
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Set the social media

319
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,023
You just put your like you to sleep hung shingle out to like how did you get people

320
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
Tire you how did you know where to go

321
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Honesty

322
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
So much of it is like it was a really a lot of the right place

323
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
Right time I was living in La it was when

324
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
I'm in food trucks for a big thing

325
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
And I kind of just spread the word

326
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
I would go to small business

327
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
Kisses and two food trucks

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
And my first client was the caffe

329
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
On my street

330
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
Not around anymore but

331
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
You're just a little cafe on Beverly Boulevard and I would

332
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
But he's sitting at Cafe all day

333
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
And sweet things like

334
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
There's a password of the day and if you say the password at the register you get like

335
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Caffe Espresso

336
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
So.

337
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
With such a mature our butt

338
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
There was also nobody doing

339
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
So

340
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
I found myself in this

341
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Kitchenware

342
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
I am getting paid

343
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
To do something

344
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
I don't know that much about it

345
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
But also at the same time everyone saw me

346
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
And it was

347
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
One of the wildest

348
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Years of my life because

349
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
My first

350
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Client was

351
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Was Buzz Coffee

352
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
And I don't even know if they paid me like I think they paid me

353
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Coffee

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
And then all the sudden I was doing it

355
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,519
For a food truck in a restaurant and then all the sudden like they introduce me to someone and I was doing it for

356
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
A new hotel that was open

357
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
And then all the sudden I realized I

358
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,967
Just spent a year being immersed in digital and social media and realizing how

359
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
How people could

360
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Could use that in a really powerful way

361
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Like I also it wasn't making a ton of money but I was

362
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,231
Size also doing like personal assistant stuff so I was a personal assistant to

363
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
The wife

364
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
As one of the heads of like one of the very big studios in LA

365
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
And then she had asked me to help her with her blog

366
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
And her social media and her website

367
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
They start helping her with that

368
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
She told her husband I was doing a great job

369
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
And all the sudden I find myself like

370
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Driving up to the lot everyday like checking in with my ID and

371
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,159
Meeting with these film Executives talking about how they could Market their films

372
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
Like your social media and this was like

373
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:32,607
This is a time when it's just starting to explode right into primarily this is like Facebook and Twitter at that

374
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Adam Wainwright

375
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Yeah I was just Facebook

376
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
But I like my space with tapering off

377
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
I mean

378
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
You were just sort of

379
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,943
Doing it right like you weren't even set up a business or a company or

380
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
You didn't sort of show the company's how the their social media impacted the world right you weren't like producing

381
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
You were just out there doing the social media

382
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Stop and

383
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
Hoping that they were happy with it

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah exactly because there are no metrics the red-nosed analytics of any sort at this time

385
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
And

386
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,847
Artistic look what I tweeted look at all these people that responded look at these people who showed up and end for me it was

387
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
That was actually great because it wasn't reported look real tangible stuff it was like

388
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
People showing up and saying some

389
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
We're doing something or spending money

390
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
At the business

391
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
I'm in that was really exciting

392
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Skip ahead

393
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Prefer sex

394
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
Because I guess eventually you were you were able to get a job at

395
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Like a legit

396
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Ad Agency New York and then and then you started

397
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Do this

398
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
What type of stuff like marketing

399
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Real

400
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,591
And then in 2011 you got recruited by Warby Parker how did that happen

401
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
So I have Tumblr to think for this one again so

402
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
My friend Rich who worked a Tumblr

403
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Would like

404
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
You could meet with these guys are starting this

405
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Glasses

406
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Company

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183
Online and they just want to talk to someone about social media

408
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Remember meeting this guy who works at Warby Parker

409
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
And we met at at Union Square Park

410
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
And

411
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:14,751
I remember realize I kind of halfway through our conversation that it was a job interview

412
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
I thought that

413
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
I just like coming in there to like chat with them about the startup and

414
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
They would like take my brain and there was something like really open to

415
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,575
And I like being like I think I just interview to be the social media manager at Warby Parker

416
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
And that's how I got started in the startup world

417
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Damn

418
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
To the cofounders have been on

419
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
The show

420
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Before and them

421
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
In the social media yet

422
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Really came up do they have

423
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
800 social media strategy when when you got there

424
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
It's still

425
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
This is the like the Stone Age is just a social media compare

426
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Compared to today but today

427
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Do they have like

428
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Accounts for all the different social media Staffing

429
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Sickly for

430
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
No customer service and

431
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
And the guy who interviewed me Brian

432
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
You're his whole job is like

433
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
Replying to everyone on Twitter which I became my job

434
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Fidget spinners

435
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
10 hours a day

436
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Plaintiff

437
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
People even if even people

438
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
Be like I love Warby Parker I would reply like

439
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Thanks

440
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Like hundreds of times a day

441
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Xian Facebook

442
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
On Twitter

443
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Are there on Tumblr

444
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
And

445
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Instagram login

446
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Right when I started

447
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Are the guys there's a school platform

448
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,903
I think we should go on it and they're like the pic or whatever

449
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
And what did you what did you do for the money

450
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Like what

451
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
Did you start to use like me like Instagram to

452
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Tepexpan

453
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Their brand

454
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Just so I think

455
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
I started thinking about

456
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
The content strategy would look like how do we

457
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
How do we take

458
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,431
This is amazing thing that we're building this kind of weird which is selling glasses online

459
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
All of my friends thought I was crazy for doing this

460
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
I like how do we how do we like translate that experience

461
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
It's like a social media community and we would do things like

462
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
Like Warby Parker had that like home try-on program to Tryon

463
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
5 pairs of glasses

464
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
And we would do it so that like people would post their 5 and like weed repost at or Tambo

465
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
And then like our community would like help them pack

466
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
There's like a big thing on on Tumblr

467
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Facebook like

468
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
We're basically crowdsource

469
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
What brands people should buy

470
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
A new disturbance

471
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
Really loyal really engaged community and its

472
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Kept growing and growing and I think

473
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
It was embarrassing to kind of like

474
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Look back at

475
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Your work

476
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,207
Especially in those early days but I really was just like

477
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
I really could feel how

478
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Social media was having a

479
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Impact on

480
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
How much people love the brand that was released

481
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
When you why you're at

482
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Warby Parker did it ever cross your mind that

483
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Like I want to start my own business one day or was that

484
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Not even

485
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
On your radar at all

486
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
No I never wanted

487
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,759
Start my own business I never wanted to be an entrepreneur

488
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
I think it was just so grateful to have found

489
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,207
Work into something that I really enjoyed and for me that was a social media and marketing

490
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Eventually

491
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Brand development

492
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
That because those opportunities

493
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
Seems so Limitless

494
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
And that I never felt like I could learn everything there was to know

495
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,823
About what I was doing that it never occurred to me to do to start my own thing

496
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
So I guess you you should have

497
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
Plasti Dip Warby Parker for

498
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
I'm about to

499
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
Plus years

500
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
And you were

501
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Recruiter ruu

502
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
You got a job with

503
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
AllSaints which is that the

504
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
The fashion brand

505
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Basement UK

506
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,047
Global head of innovation you would like

507
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
26 27 years old

508
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,471
Happy that happen when I join Warby Parker there where

509
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
8015 p

510
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
People there

511
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
By the time I left there were a couple hundred

512
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
So

513
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
It was still growing really quickly I still left like

514
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Pretty early days but my my father passed away while I was working at Warby Parker and it kind of

515
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
It like I kind of

516
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
Slow down a little bit after that and I start thinking a lot about what I wanted to be doing and coincidentally like this head

517
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Headhunter called me at the same time as kind of going through that

518
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
And moving to London

519
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
I

520
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Seems like

521
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
The most exciting things I could do and I was so drawn to the opportunity

522
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Thing to do with anything

523
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
I'd ever done

524
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
Before so I became

525
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
The global director of innovation at all

526
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
And this is when they were there trying to turn the company around they had new owners and new CEO

527
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Yo

528
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,352
Has 26 or 27 and I had a seat at the table

529
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,448
With all these like very seasoned Executives from

530
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
I'm selfridges and Harrods and

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,384
Engagement from Warby Parker and they wanted some of that magic

532
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
For their brand freezing Italy

533
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
Basically the new CEO

534
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
At All Saints

535
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
I think I just

536
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
Wanted someone from Warby Parker it was like

537
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,208
Great job great title like I got to live in London

538
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,608
I didn't realize until after the fact that what was missing is that might our career had revolved around the idea that

539
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
There's a Brad

540
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
And that

541
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Someone in the middle does something

542
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
And then

543
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Does

544
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
A customer at the other end Who falls in love with it

545
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
And I don't mind her career around like

546
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
That middle

547
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Like being in the gap

548
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Between

549
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
The customer and the brat

550
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
Building a relationship making people fall in love with the company

551
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
And because all of my projects at All Saints

552
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,280
Turned out to be internal facing and more like internal innovation

553
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
I realize that was the part

554
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
But I really miss

555
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,936
A bike wasn't wise enough to realize that at the time

556
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
I bet I can get space

557
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
So what

558
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
What happened what did you mean

559
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
We just kind of

560
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Waiting tip

561
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
To figure it out

562
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Yeah I was waiting to figure it out

563
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
I've always promised myself that I would

564
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Only

565
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Work on things it

566
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,928
Made me happy especially after my dad passed away was like really poor

567
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
For me to

568
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,304
To spend my time doing things that I was really passionate about and I knew that I had kind of

569
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Dried up for me and this opportunity

570
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
Since I left

571
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
I left all Saints

572
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
And I was still living in London

573
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Kind of

574
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
For finite amount of time

575
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:48,224
Because my Visa was going to expire so I started interviewing for jobs

576
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
I

577
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
Interviewed for like

578
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
VP of marketing like CMO.

579
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,392
Sat companies of all different sizes

580
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:01,280
And during this I completely just on a tear around the world

581
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Splitting my time between

582
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
Interviewing and like going on vacation

583
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,984
So I'm in Zurich Airport

584
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
And

585
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
My back break

586
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
And it was this

587
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,664
Old dog that I'd had

588
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
Texas College I guess

589
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
No name

590
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
Like black ballistic nylon bag

591
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
Super Mario saying like I didn't realize it broke

592
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
I didn't realize a zipper broke so I'm leaving a trail of like

593
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:35,328
My underwear behind me as I'm as I'm running through the airport

594
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
And

595
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
I get home and

596
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
I

597
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Go on Facebook

598
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,592
And I told her about this embarrassing story about my back breaking and I asked

599
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
People if they have any record

600
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,480
4 News

601
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Just trying to shop

602
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,856
This is like this is like 2015 this isn't thought that long

603
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
2015

604
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
At that point I've travelled

605
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,792
Hundreds of thousands of miles in my life with this one bag

606
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,144
And I was super annoyed and I was just like okay I'm just going to buy a really nice bag

607
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
But I love and this won't happen again for a while

608
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
What time

609
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
So

610
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
I asked a bunch of

611
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
People in every single person is like

612
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
I don't know or

613
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,040
I have this but don't get it it's awful or or I would specifically ask a friend

614
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
That and you traveled a lot

615
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
And here she would be like

616
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,232
You know what what brand a table with and I think

617
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
So crazy to me that

618
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
All of these people including myself

619
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,728
Who love to travel who did it all the time who packed a suitcase every time they travel

620
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Really had

621
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
No connection to

622
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
This thing that they brought with them

623
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Get on every single flight on every

624
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Most people

625
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Bogota like

626
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
Target r

627
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
TJ Maxx or something or

628
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Marshalls in just like

629
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
Go to CK sorry and get a suitcase

630
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Yeah and I didn't want to do that which is why I asked them

631
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
And then if I found out that like

632
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
No one really had luggage that they

633
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
There is

634
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
One girl

635
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Really loved her

636
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
And it was like 4000

637
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
Even though they make $4,000 luggage

638
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
So what I thought to myself was

639
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
I have to find the spread

640
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
There has to be a great luggage

641
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Yeah like I didn't I didn't

642
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
Start my toes just like we're not looking for

643
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Just be clear

644
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,392
You weren't looking for the category start a business in

645
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
No not at all not at all know I was like

646
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
I wanted to go shopping

647
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
I wanted to buy the right thing so that this wouldn't happen

648
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,168
I was I was crowdsourcing for answers

649
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
I didn't get it

650
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
And these are people

651
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Who I have liked

652
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Emmaus

653
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
A network of friends over time

654
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
MC2

655
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Whose taste I really trust Whose advice

656
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
I take and

657
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
No one had

658
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Any advice from

659
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Iran is like good luck

660
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
So I started to think

661
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Why doesn't this luggage brand exist

662
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
That's like how come buying luggage

663
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Is so awful

664
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
I like how come you have to go

665
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
It's like the basement of a department store or

666
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm your New York there's all these like

667
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Crazy luggage stores in Midtown

668
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
There are massive and

669
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
And you go in and there's a

670
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
The $500 bag

671
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
Text a $50 bag and they look exactly the same

672
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
And I

673
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
I like the luggage sales man is like whispering in your ear like

674
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
I can give you 30% off

675
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
If you buy it right now

676
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
Why is it so horrible

677
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
So

678
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
That's when

679
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
I maybe thought

680
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
That I could

681
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
Start something like at this point

682
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
Because interviewing for jobs and in my head I was like I can start a little luggage business

683
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
On the side

684
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
I like make it like

685
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
Some cool brand

686
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
And maybe sell it at

687
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,200
Like at liberty or on Netta Forte or like this cool places that I like to shop

688
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
And that's when I caught up with

689
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Stuff

690
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
Parker

691
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,160
I met Steph Curry and we started on the same day

692
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,744
And we became fast friends and we're friends

693
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,328
All throughout my time at Warby Parker

694
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
Sharon supply chain there

695
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
So she's in charge of how

696
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
The glasses where me is like

697
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
The factories that we got him from like how they got

698
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
To the states to be shipped to customers

699
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Stuff that

700
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
I actually

701
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
Technically went to school for but really didn't know much about

702
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Kind of went through this like

703
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
Hypocrisy growth of Warby Parker together

704
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
And we stayed friends and we like Loosely kept in touch we check in

705
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
Every few months

706
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
So just has this like

707
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
Is little baby idea

708
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Of making luggage that my friends would love

709
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Was brewing in my head

710
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
I I reach out to staff and

711
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Facebook message

712
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
And I said hey there

713
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
Something I've been thinking about would love to catch

714
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
With you

715
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
And

716
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
She was

717
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
Chisholm business school at the time so should we will be Parker

718
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah she left her B Parker to go to business school at Columbia

719
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
And I

720
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
She just always been my son

721
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Sounding board

722
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
So I called her catch up

723
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
And I was mostly complaining

724
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
I was like

725
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Good luggage brand doesn't exist like

726
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
I have a bunch of ideas like I think

727
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
I think I could make like a cool one

728
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Also how annoying have to go interview

729
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Other job

730
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
I was just catching up

731
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
And this was supposed to be a 10-minute

732
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Call and

733
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
3 hours later

734
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
First on the phone

735
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
And

736
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,344
Basically she was in business school and she had been looking

737
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
And she was the one who was like

738
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
What we did at Warby Parker

739
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768

NPR

785
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Okay so it's 2015

786
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
And Jen Rubio and steph korey

787
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
We have this idea for

788
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Better luggage

789
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
But to start working on it

790
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Take a leap of faith

791
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Because at the time

792
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Both of them work interviewing

793
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Other jobs

794
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
So I still living in London and I was in

795
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
Pretty late

796
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Stages

797
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
To be VP of marketing at this fashion

798
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Stuff is in business school and talking to a few startups about

799
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
Being like their VP of supply chain

800
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
And I

801
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
And I was

802
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
I was actually being flown into New York

803
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Or like one of my final interviews

804
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,912
And I realize I was doing the interview that I was like

805
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
I don't want to do this

806
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,240
I want to do the luggage

807
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,872
I don't remember how wet but I got the job offer

808
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
And I really didn't want to take it

809
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Because I had been

810
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
So excited

811
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
About

812
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
About this idea

813
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
4 luggage brand

814
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
That I actually wrote

815
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
I wrote stuff in email

816
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
About how

817
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
I never wanted to be an entrepreneur before but like

818
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Was really passionate about this a to ya

819
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
And I thought that we were the two perfect people to do it

820
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:15,776
Animate a whole list of everything I wanted a co-founder and then explain how she embodied

821
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,336
All of those things like I wanted someone

822
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Crye-Leike

823
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Complimentary

824
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,272
Skillset and like had other lucrative opportunities that they were turning down to do this which is like

825
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
Weird qualifier but was really important to me

826
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
And it wasn't until

827
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
I wrote that email

828
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Like asking her to be my co-founder

829
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
And asking her to do this with me

830
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
That

831
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,096
That was the point of kind of realize

832
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
I wanted to be

833
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
Did you did you come up with the name already at that point

834
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
I was looking for

835
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
It's a wild story about how he came up with it but

836
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
As I was doing my research I was like

837
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
Try to stay organized

838
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
I made like a folder on my computer

839
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Peter

840
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
And it was like

841
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,416
TBD luggage brand and one day I like open my computer

842
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,976
And I just typed in a way

843
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
As a placeholder like it just came

844
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
And I always had it in my head

845
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
There's no way we can use it away as

846
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Brand name

847
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
Just simple like four letter word

848
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
Sick extremely common

849
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
And then it stopped

850
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,128
She spent a lot of time like brainstorming new names but we just never came up

851
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
With anything

852
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
As good

853
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
And she found like

854
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
Some trademark lawyers

855
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
And ask them

856
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
If we could trade market and they basically laughed in her face

857
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
I just like

858
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,280
Cilic insisted that they looked into it and then a week later they called us and they said

859
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
You have been given a gift in the marketing gods

860
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Because

861
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,448
This trademark is available in your category in a lot of different

862
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Countries

863
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
Alright so you have a name and

864
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
What's the first step like how do you

865
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
Luggage made like where do you where you going to start

866
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
Yashow kind of like

867
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
Our first steps made sense to us because

868
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
We R Who We R I had this

869
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
Branding background should the supply

870
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
And I was like

871
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Okay we need to get a brand new

872
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Like we need someone

873
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
To do that it was still like we didn't have a product

874
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Pretty middle how to make it

875
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
But I was like I'm going to start working on the brand

876
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
I need to design

877
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Light design

878
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
The suitcases are going to look like

879
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Oh yeah I didn't

880
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Think about that

881
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
I'd like I can sell any

882
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,336
I was like we have two brand it like what are you branding like the company

883
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Budget

884
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Chicano Batman

885
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,968
So I think that's where my head was at and

886
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
SF is like okay well we have to like come up with a product

887
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
It's also how did you find

888
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Like I mean how did you

889
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
Begin the day cuz I have assumed

890
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
Suitcases are probably mainly made in China

891
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
In terms of

892
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Finding a place to make them and

893
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
Designers and

894
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Like what was the

895
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
What did you do that how did you

896
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
What to do

897
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Yeah so we

898
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
At Warby Parker

899
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Except easily learn

900
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
How to make things

901
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
An object Industries are different but she had

902
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
A bunch of contacts in China

903
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Kushiyaki

904
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
4

905
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Intros to like in the luggage space

906
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
Yuri Casas y that we realize that

907
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
There are

908
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Lots of different factories

909
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
Like a varying degrees of

910
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Being good at what they do

911
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
And like varying degrees of working conditions and like

912
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
An end product and all of that

913
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
That we couldn't really make a decision

914
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Until we had decided

915
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
And

916
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
In the first few weeks were just like really intense

917
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
Like our intense version of like market research

918
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
Wish shopping

919
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Every single day

920
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
Logic every department store

921
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
We went to every luggage store

922
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,720
Am I compared all the experiences and all the prices like at very meticulous notes

923
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
On what was out there

924
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,632
Mainly cuz we couldn't afford to pay for the industry reports the real like we'll just figure this out ourselves

925
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
So

926
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
We start shopping for luggage

927
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
And we're like

928
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,080
Getting a better sense of like what was being offered it still wasn't super clear to us

929
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
So we decided that

930
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
To really create the perfect luggage we need to actually figure out what people wanted

931
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,040
So over the course of a few months

932
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
800 people

933
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,952
And we would just talk to them about travel and we would ask them things like

934
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
Not even about luggage but about their biggest pain points

935
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
When they travel and we discovered things like

936
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,424
People get hotel rooms and they would like

937
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,264
Steel laundry bags from hotels because like they didn't have their own

938
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,616
Or that you know everybody like wanted a bag that they could

939
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,688
Fit a ton of stuff in but also have it be

940
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,272
Flexible but also really durable and like really lightweight

941
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
And then something we heard what time it was

942
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,720
My biggest pain Point like one of my biggest pain points when I travel is like my phone always dies

943
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
I'm at the airport so we were basically armed with

944
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,912
I would not a list of features but but story is that kept coming up

945
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
And that's how

946
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,776
We figure it out all of the things we needed to make like

947
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
R1 perfect suitcase

948
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
So as the the design process

949
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
Began what look like how did that work

950
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
What did you

951
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,576
Yeah so basically you know second I had this list and

952
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
Then I knew what I wanted it

953
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
To look like

954
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
And I

955
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
You know we're basically up

956
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Like 20 hours a day

957
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Because

958
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
Ivar dustrial designers rent Tampa

959
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
Yes, we had factories that we were talking to in China

960
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
I'm busily II

961
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
One of them

962
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Rodi send email

963
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,640
Like we would make sure to write back or pass it on so there would be no delays

964
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Because also in all of this

965
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
A night to this day don't know where

966
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Came from

967
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
You know this way

968
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,648
A January 6th February of 2015

969
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
And we had it in our heads

970
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
That we wanted to launch my

971
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,536
So in less than a year we wanted to have like

972
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
What product out into the world

973
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
Luckily like we really didn't have anything else

974
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,704
To do so we just like immerse ourselves fully in this

975
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,496
And we're just obsessed

976
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Everything

977
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,360
So I guess it's amazing is by

978
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
This idea really begins

979
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
In 2015 like

980
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
January February 2015

981
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
By November of that year

982
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
You guys managed to raise

983
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
Like two and a half million dollars from

984
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
From

985
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
DC company is yeah

986
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,352
Was it was it hard to get I mean it was hard to make

987
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Make the case cuz it sounds like

988
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
G-Eazy I mean

989
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
Pretty quickly after that you had the idea

990
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Yeso

991
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
In March

992
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
2050

993
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Like when this was

994
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Barely an idea I like we still

995
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
Didn't have a Time directions what we were doing

996
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
A friend of mine in San Francisco

997
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
Introduce me to Eureka him

998
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
He's a partner at Forerunner

999
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
And

1000
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Forerunner is the

1001
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488
The VC firm that invested in Warby Parker and everlane

1002
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
And Dollar Shave Club in jet.com

1003
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
And they just had like

1004
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Amazing portfolio and he's amazing wins

1005
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,496
And we had heard about them Odyssey when we worked at werribee but didn't really interact

1006
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
To them

1007
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
And my friend was like I'll introduce you to one of the partners

1008
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,152
Me like I just had like

1009
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
The audacity to

1010
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Schedule a meeting with her even though

1011
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
We literally had

1012
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
At this point we still got away with the place

1013
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:29,184
It was just like an idea to create this thing and we were busy just like in the throes of

1014
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
Doing research

1015
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,560
Verizon San Francisco and I met with Yuri and I kind of like

1016
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
It was busy just like a meeting of me being excited

1017
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
About what we're doing

1018
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
In my head it wasn't

1019
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
Me pitching her

1020
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
But because of that

1021
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,664
But because of that early meeting and because of like her wanting to stay in touch

1022
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,504
And excited about the agnc how excited we were about the idea

1023
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
We stayed in touch

1024
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Which meant that when we actually went out to raise

1025
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
RC drowned in the summer

1026
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
We already had like a

1027
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,792
Like a foot in the door with one of the firms that we wanted to partner with

1028
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
I meant we pitched a lot of

1029
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Because a lot of VC is like a

1030
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,192
Crazy process really super diligent we had

1031
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Is crazy spreadsheet of every single Venture Capital firm who'd ever invested in a direct-to-consumer brand

1032
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Who the partner wasn't

1033
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
Each permit did it

1034
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,528
If we had any like Mutual connections on LinkedIn like how we would get to them we had this like

1035
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
Crazy master plan for for fundraising really thought this through

1036
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
You really did your homework

1037
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
Yeah I mean I think

1038
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
I think part of it was at like

1039
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
That deadline to Launch

1040
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
In 2015

1041
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Came from nobody but us

1042
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
We really wanted to do it I don't even know where that timeline came

1043
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,128
And you want us to do in time for Christmas

1044
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,431
Merry Christmas ya

1045
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,015
We're like this would be like a great way to law to get a ton of press

1046
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,367
So we had the self-imposed deadline looming above our heads but like

1047
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
Once you're down

1048
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:09,791
We stuck to it and that meant being super methodical and everything we were doing whether it was designing the product

1049
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,839
Or fundraising or just like

1050
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
Literally anything that we were doing

1051
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,263
Sissy drowned in the summer and we talked a lot of investors and

1052
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
And Yuri Kim at Forerunner ended up kohli-dang

1053
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
RC Drone

1054
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,455
And she actually brought in the other Kool-Aid which was

1055
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
Brian O'Malley from

1056
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
Sell at a time

1057
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,343
So you guys I mean by that summer you get your

1058
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Picture of million-dollar

1059
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
2 million

1060
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
So what was

1061
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
Plan in the summer of 2015

1062
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,559
The plan was

1063
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
To launch before Christmas and we had known from

1064
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
Previous experience at the

1065
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
It was like a very

1066
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Behr lucrative time

1067
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
2 to launch something

1068
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
All the media does guess guys

1069
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
There's also like

1070
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,943
A lot of demand for human interest stories and things like that's what all these angles

1071
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
What's that we wanted to hit

1072
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
The PC the plan was

1073
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:07,903
To launch the suitcases and get a lot of press cuz when you

1074
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
From Warby Parker that

1075
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Depressive debate

1076
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
A part of

1077
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,607
Forgot to self write they have disliked article in GQ or Vogue or something

1078
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
Petition definition

1079
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,823
July August of 2015 like the big magazines are already

1080
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
30 making decisions about their Christmas issues

1081
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
At this point the gift giving guide

1082
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Yeah so we didn't do that

1083
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,527
At the time

1084
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
We're like

1085
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
We are whole thing was

1086
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Watch Before Christmas got a lot of press

1087
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Solana tequila

1088
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,583
But we found out when we placed our order in August

1089
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,727
That because of the way we designed the bags and we use like all these like top-of-the-line components and we had

1090
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,823
Looked at like every single supplier and wanted all the best thing to mulch suppliers

1091
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,151
That there was no way that our back would be ready before Christmas

1092
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,943
Wow

1093
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Which

1094
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
I don't know why it was so surprising to us were like

1095
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
What do you mean like we have this

1096
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
Timeline in the spreadsheet and it says

1097
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,415
The spreadsheet that we meet up

1098
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:17,023
And it said that if we ordered the bags by August we would have them

1099
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
And it's so weird that this whole world did not adhere to our timeline

1100
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
And it was as if like someone had said like we had to stop doing the

1101
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,239
Company it was a self-imposed deadline

1102
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
At this point

1103
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
We actually started

1104
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,151
Like we didn't even have a suitcase set and we've already started talking

1105
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,991
Two editors intellect potential PR agencies about what we were do

1106
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
And he'd gotten some really good feedback so

1107
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
But didn't they want to see

1108
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
Suitcase or did you where you say men like

1109
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
Photos of it

1110
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
We were sending them like

1111
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,743
What's 3D rendering

1112
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
And we're mostly just like

1113
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Selling them on

1114
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
On this idea that

1115
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Don't like

1116
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Before us

1117
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,471
Amazing affordable luggage did not exist

1118
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
And

1119
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Beyond that there's like

1120
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Is whole brand that was a

1121
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
Successful travel the way that they were

1122
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
And that we were created

1123
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,711
Secured is excited about that

1124
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,527
And when we found out the bags were going to be ready we're like

1125
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
So what are we going to Lodge like

1126
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Quit we can't watch suits

1127
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
So

1128
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
Obviously our options are like don't launch or push it back

1129
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
Wasn't on the table

1130
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Price for whatever

1131
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
Or we could lunch with the pre-order

1132
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Which I think is just like

1133
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
The most boring thing you can do when you're launching a brand like

1134
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
No one wants

1135
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
2

1136
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Put their credit card down for something that they like merriment

1137
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Not yet

1138
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
So we came up with this idea

1139
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
And the idea was

1140
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
That

1141
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,991
We would come up with something before Christmas that people would want to buy

1142
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,551
That would show them that we were like this amazing Utah

1143
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
So they're due to write a book

1144
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,047
Or a single suitcases come off the Factory The Factory

1145
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
I said I'm just like I was

1146
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,703
I usually get this freak with all these crazy ideas and stuff and be like okay okay we can make this work like

1147
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:05,311
We were just total enabler this is going to be a book of your flight photos of your luggage

1148
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,431
No so basically I was like 4 like

1149
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,527
We have to show people that that were an exciting you travel Brad

1150
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,599
And that that they're going to love us

1151
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
So the book was we were going to find 40 tastemakers like not celebrities but people who had really

1152
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
A strong Community like people who he wanted to vouch for us Anjali and my friend who would like a freelancer

1153
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,799
40 magazine envogue and into the gloss she was going to interview these people about like

1154
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,103
Your favorite place to travel to

1155
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
And to write the little blurb

1156
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,967
And we realize it like we would need

1157
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:50,367
Photos in the book Ruby really boring so she would also ask them for their vacation photos and we came up with this list

1158
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
Of a people that she would interview

1159
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
And the whole plan was to write this book

1160
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
+ 2

1161
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,351
Yeah we had to do was just us into designers at the time

1162
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,911
And we got them to agree to design the book

1163
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,519
So we're like we're going make a coffee table book and then inside the coffee table book

1164
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
We're going to put a gif

1165
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Card

1166
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
The people can redeem

1167
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
For the log

1168
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
Wait let me just

1169
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
Yuan raised to 1/2 million dollars from

1170
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
PCS who wanted you to make

1171
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Luggage

1172
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,159
Uni using that money to come up with a coffee table book of people

1173
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Vacations

1174
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:34,655
I just I just would like that anybody say hey what are you guys doing or or do they not really no

1175
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,727
What's actually funny because when we were trying

1176
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
How to choose our and

1177
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
A lot of the feedback that we got really

1178
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
Oh you're kind of Warby Parker for luggage

1179
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
Great will invest

1180
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Another Super

1181
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
The other feedback was like

1182
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
Yeah we show them a picture of the leg

1183
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
I get like a rendering of the luggage and they'd be like

1184
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
I don't get it

1185
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
It's just like it's like what's different about it we're like

1186
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Well here's all the great things about the

1187
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
The product but also

1188
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
And then I would go on and on about

1189
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
Brand that we rebuild

1190
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
I knew that I would like a ramble about the band and I was like

1191
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,471
Like we make luggage but we're travel bran it's really going to connect

1192
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,799
People and that's the whole idea for away is that

1193
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
People

1194
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Didn't emotionally connect with

1195
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
Samsonite or Tumi or any of these other brands

1196
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,039
And basically the feces that we ended up going with we're the ones

1197
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Who got

1198
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
That brand

1199
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,439
With this tangible thing that we could make uniquely ours and that's what would said

1200
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
So every time

1201
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,303
And even not like everytime you come up here like some

1202
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,095
Crazy idea like this they're like

1203
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,167
Okay must be for the brand so no one questioned what we did

1204
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
Where we going to sell the book

1205
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
So we're going to that was like the book

1206
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
But the thing that we were going to sell

1207
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
Also we had set up this whole website

1208
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
To sell luggage

1209
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,967
That wasn't going to be ready so then we change the website

1210
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
To sell the book

1211
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:58,111
Wait so if you were on the away website in November of 2015 you could only buy

1212
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
The away coffee table book you could not buy suitcase

1213
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
Yeah I mean I guess

1214
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,559
I guess I could different way of looking at it would be like you would

1215
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,631
Is this a pre-order for the suitcase that you would get the book

1216
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
And the reason we did that was because

1217
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
We wanted people to be able to like give

1218
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,799
People things for the holidays like something tangible

1219
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,127
So yes if you want on the website

1220
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
November 2015

1221
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
You buy the coffee table book

1222
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
And the book would come

1223
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,343
Put a gift card for the suitcase but you'd have to go back on the website in February

1224
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
Turning the gift card and it was like

1225
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,975
Crazy likely sufficient

1226
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Idea

1227
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
On paper and even now as I'm telling you

1228
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
But stuff like

1229
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,399
You know what I think this could really work and we made

1230
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
2000's books

1231
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
And I'm I remember like the books got delivered the Haley's food boxes and I think Stephen I looked at each other

1232
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,431
This is either a great idea or we're going to have these books

1233
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
MS Office like

1234
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:02,367
Fraternity around we had

1235
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
We had lined up

1236
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
A bunch of progress we invested a ton of time and

1237
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
And meeting with editors like getting into foam up with with us and the idea and the product that would eventually launch

1238
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:21,055
And a November 9th 2015 we woke up and there's a big feature on

1239
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
Boat.com all about the travel brand

1240
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:30,271
And that was our lunch and we had the book on the website and we basically spent the whole day like

1241
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Profession Google analytics refreshing are like a dashboard for the platform that you were selling on

1242
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,487
And people just started buying the book

1243
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
How much does it cost

1244
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,887
Well you have to basically you had to buy the book for $225

1245
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Which is the price

1246
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
Of the First suitcase

1247
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,543
And we sold hundreds on the first day Thursday

1248
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
On the first day I'm a bunch of other outlets picked it up all of the people in The Bookworm

1249
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,807
Like really excited about it like a big dinner everyone's posting about it

1250
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
And the next day like a hundred more sold and then and then more the next day and by the end of a couple of

1251
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
We had sold out

1252
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,583
Of all of the books and each book represented

1253
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,191
One suitcase that we ordered so it's sold out of our first order

1254
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:25,823
Is it still did not have a single suitcase like in stock in the US

1255
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,663
Ivory suitcase

1256
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
That would come in February with a

1257
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
Show February of 2000

1258
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
16 suitcases were going to arrive

1259
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
My prom dress

1260
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
And how and where do they live

1261
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
Steps to becoming like a giant

1262
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Shipping container

1263
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
To look up

1264
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Warehouse in New

1265
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
Yasso

1266
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
So that should be it because

1267
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
Soda like the holidays happened

1268
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
We sold the Box

1269
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
But like our minds were blow and we were like

1270
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
Look at the appetite for

1271
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
For the spread like all the stuff

1272
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
We told you she is real

1273
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
And we actually weren't sure if it would be

1274
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,199
That felt great

1275
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
But then we're like

1276
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
Okay we actually have two

1277
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
To get the light

1278
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Over here

1279
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
So right after Christmas we flew to our fact

1280
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,439
And we actually spent days like

1281
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,743
In the factory on the production line

1282
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Doing like

1283
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047
Quality control

1284
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Checking every suitcase

1285
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Like Steph and I were like

1286
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:25,727
We're standing there with all the factory workers like we inspected every bag off of the line

1287
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
They got packaged

1288
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,311
In their boxes

1289
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,639
Were you happy with them to do they look do they look the way you wanted them to

1290
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,455
Yeah it was it was a dream come true

1291
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Because we basically spent

1292
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
An entire year.

1293
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Just imagining

1294
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
I'm in designing it and like

1295
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
And putting in the work

1296
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,719
And I had never been a part of that process before of

1297
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,791
I like coming up with in designing something from scratch

1298
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Annunciating

1299
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,839
The end result

1300
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
I'm through a lot of Tears

1301
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:58,751
It was a very emotional time but we were on the factory floor like crying

1302
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
Like hugging this

1303
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,639
Fiesta. Was January like they put them on a boat

1304
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
They made their way over and

1305
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
We sold our first

1306
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Physical suit

1307
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
In February of 2006

1308
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
That year

1309
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
I think

1310
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
In your first

1311
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
The first year you actually had the

1312
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
SE cases

1313
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
UE wenzhou upselling 55

1314
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,559
1000 suitcases which is amazing

1315
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
How did people

1316
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Find out about

1317
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
I mean

1318
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
I think what we saw

1319
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Pretty quickly is that

1320
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Our timing was perfect

1321
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:35,615
We were in this time and social media where travel is

1322
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,943
Status symbol everyone wanted to post about

1323
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Not just

1324
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,807
Their trips and like nauseous about the beach that they're on or like the mountain that

1325
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,111
Just getting on but by how they got there

1326
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:49,695
And people taking photos at airports or or even when they were pocket

1327
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,791
And stuff and I realize it would be hard to be a part of this

1328
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
And we had to be the bag

1329
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:00,959
In all those photos that people are posting as they were talking or as they were

1330
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
At the airport

1331
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,567
So we basically found I mean in the beginning

1332
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,383
NBA news a lot of press and then it was a lot of

1333
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
Basically anyone we knew on social media that had a lot of followers like asking them to post about the bag

1334
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,855
During that kind of like pre-trip

1335
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
And we made it so that

1336
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:25,023
Anytime you open Instagram and then someone was like getting ready for a trip

1337
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
They would be posting a photo with their waste

1338
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
How did you I mean

1339
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Pretty I guess

1340
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
Pretty soon you were

1341
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
Even celebrities were

1342
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
Starting to use the bags

1343
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Like Rashida Jones and

1344
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,175
Karlie Kloss and I mean did you did you deliberately seek them out and say

1345
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
Hey check out our bags

1346
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
I think what happened was

1347
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
We give it a couple celebrities and I can't remember who but

1348
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
PS celebrities

1349
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,975
Get their photo taken by Paparazzi when they leave the airport

1350
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
So

1351
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,791
The bag would start showing up

1352
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
Like in all these magazines

1353
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
As

1354
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
As celebrities were leaving Airport

1355
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
So I think they did a lot for

1356
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Growing our customer base

1357
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
And also other celebrities seeing it

1358
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,079
But I think what's been amazing is that like

1359
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,383
Celebrities were so drawn

1360
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
To the brand

1361
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,039
Every celebrity collaboration we've ever done has been because

1362
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
That's the lad has been

1363
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
It was crazy like I don't I don't know how.

1364
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,487
I like when we first launched the book and we were like looking at the orders come in

1365
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,791
Elliot see the names of every single person

1366
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,583
Who ordered

1367
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,447
Yeah and I'm ever be like oh I know that person from college like they must have seen on Facebook or

1368
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Like I used to work with that person

1369
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,823
And it'd be like names of people being you and then maybe like

1370
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
Name the people we didn't know

1371
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
But then once in awhile like

1372
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,991
Marching orders come in one day

1373
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Laura Jean Witherspoon

1374
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Order.

1375
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Assassins

1376
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,623
Dusted out loud

1377
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,183
I like that's Reese Witherspoon that's her real name

1378
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
You know that

1379
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,839
Alex she had heard about it from like one of these articles are one of these influencers

1380
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
And she ordered a box of Jackson has one of our

1381
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
Like original books

1382
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Send the bag

1383
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
You started this company

1384
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
To view

1385
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,079
How many employees do you have now

1386
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Because a 200

1387
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
15 points wow

1388
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
It is pretty unbelievable

1389
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
You

1390
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,831
It is unbelievable that you start this company in 25

1391
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Game

1392
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Today

1393
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
You know

1394
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
3 + years later

1395
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
You know you're doing

1396
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
The last I've seen is

1397
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
50 million Revenue probably higher today

1398
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,679
So we've sold over 1 million

1399
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
I mean

1400
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
It gets

1401
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,335
It's pretty amazing how quickly that's happened but at the same time like

1402
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
You really

1403
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
Mercy wings and staff

1404
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Can do this with

1405
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
A lot of experience

1406
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
An experience a really kind of

1407
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
Set you up

1408
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
To succeed in

1409
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,879
And this Venture like this was

1410
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
Thank you

1411
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
The time to

1412
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
Turn the ropes and

1413
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,607
It's it's not surprising that it's

1414
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
Succeeded so quickly

1415
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
Does it surprise you

1416
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
I think that

1417
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
Things have been moving so quickly that

1418
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Like I don't think we stopping us like

1419
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
I think about

1420
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
What happened

1421
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
What we've done

1422
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,247
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that

1423
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
We're so dead

1424
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,063
Different and

1425
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,111
Basically like any strength

1426
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:35,487
The staff has is like my weakness and and vice versa so that might like from the beginning we had

1427
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
All bases covered

1428
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,583
So I feel like

1429
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,447
Even if this wasn't a runaway success we would have done things like twice as quickly or

1430
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
Are twice as good as anyone else

1431
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,591
Like from the beginning operated is like one brain

1432
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
I mean I don't know I think it's like

1433
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,735
I never set out to do this I never set out to

1434
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,831
Toronto company with the hundreds of people and I think

1435
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,135
What's asked of you when when you have

1436
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,975
Couple dozen employees and maybe like a couple million Revenue

1437
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,279
Is so different then

1438
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,863
And what is being asked for us now before us like

1439
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Well externally

1440
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:19,007
It definitely has been successful in real exciting and said they were really proud of

1441
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,895
Where where does like we're constantly like behind the scenes like trying to fix things or trying to

1442
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,919
Trying to keep up with that

1443
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Yeah

1444
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,759
Investor meetings

1445
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
They'll sit there look at you

1446
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,439
To see if you have what it takes or if you have the idea that can turn into

1447
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
A 1 billion dollar company

1448
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
El Sol Dante

1449
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
How to create a billion dollar company

1450
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,495
And now the kinds of investors that we meet with her that we're getting to know for the next phase of the business will say things

1451
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
Games like yeah we really

1452
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
You're really just evaluating to

1453
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
See if this can be like

1454
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
5 or 10 billion

1455
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Which which is mine blower

You've got

1460
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
Oh my God like your entire career

1461
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
Where do you see this company going

1462
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,279
I mean do you what what do you what do you imagine a wavy

1463
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Becoming a

1464
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,071
Beyond

1465
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Company that

1466
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Sells hookah

1467
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,447
Emily 31 sorry

1468
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,495
I'm sorry

1469
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,103
I mean I saw a thing for us

1470
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,759
It's funny because the future Away really goes back to what we were saying in those first investor mean

1471
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
We're building this travel brand

1472
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,647
And I think we talked about it a lot but we didn't really know what it meant

1473
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,463
When you were going to travel Brad and we're going to start by selling

1474
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
Luggage

1475
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
But

1476
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,559
We became so obsessed

1477
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
We just every part of the cow

1478
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
Experience

1479
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,215
So I think you know in the short-term like our goal right now is

1480
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
The way you would go to like

1481
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Turn Nike

1482
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,895
If you're if you're playing sports and you kind of get

1483
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
You can get everything from like 1

1484
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,247
Sportswear brand and they make all the difference

1485
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Things like we want to do that

1486
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
Asia travel

1487
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
When someone's going on a trip

1488
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,159
We want to make everything they need to go on that

1489
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
You must lie

1490
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
I think in the long-term like what we've done

1491
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,839
Or what we're trying to do is really set this foundation for

1492
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
How do we create a brand

1493
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,983
That people love and Trust enough so that we can solve every single part of the problem

1494
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,055
How much do you think of

1495
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
How much you think

1496
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,663
Luck played a part in in your success and how much do you think it was

1497
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
Hard working skills

1498
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Allen

1499
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,783
I think it's on

1500
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
It's probably

1501
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,671
50/50 I mean I think for me personally luck and timing

1502
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
That's so much to do with

1503
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,279
With everything I've done at every single step

1504
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,583
Sometimes it like the way we time thing

1505
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
For the people that we met

1506
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,703
Or even just the fact that like he was really lucky that I called staff

1507
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
When I did

1508
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,775
And that we didn't take the job that we were supposed to

1509
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
But I think

1510
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
We

1511
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
We work our tails off

1512
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Especially

1513
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,943
In that procedure

1514
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,991
Obsessing over everything

1515
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,783
I mean I don't know I think it's like

1516
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
Every time

1517
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
I saw something that is

1518
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
Excited me

1519
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
I would find a way to do it

1520
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,975
Like I never thought oh I need to

1521
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:25,375
Get a degree to do that or any test certain Works. To do that I would just find a way to do it and I think I'm just

1522
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:30,495
A very curious person that's of something I learned from my dad actually and

1523
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,895
I just followed all of my Curiosities

1524
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:42,527
Rubio of a way the company has expanded its product line Abyss

1525
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
Ebags Emma Factory floor in addition to their signature hard shell suitcases and now sells duffle bag

1526
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,719
Backpacks

1527
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:55,071
And the brand continues to gain more and more celebrity fan

1528
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Including most recently

1529
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
Duchess Meghan Markle

1530
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:04,543
Quarterly gifted away suitcases as party favors at a baby shower

1531
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,039
And please do stick around because in just a moment

1532
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
Hear from you about

1533
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
That stings your building

1534
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
But first

1535
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
A quick message

1536
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
One of our sponsors

1537
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
Smart Water

1538
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
Inspired by fresh

1539
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Thinkers who

1540
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
Stories you're listening to

1541
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
Smart water has more ways to hydrate

1542
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
Smart Water alkaline 9 + pH

1543
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
SmartWater antioxidant

1544
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Added selenium

1545
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Smart Water

1546
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
Retard

1547
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,175
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

1548
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,223
Timeout for how you got that

1549
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,039
Is it a story comes to us from John moroney

1550
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,367
Who lives just outside Grand Rapids in Michigan

1551
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,511
Way back in November of 2015 the Snows came early to the east side of Lake Michigan

1552
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
And what happened then

1553
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,583
John decided to take the kids

1554
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,935
Something fun and grab a few slides and go find a hill

1555
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
And then spent hours

1556
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,311
And as John watched his kids slide down the hill he said hey

1557
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
I want to get in on the action because

1558
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,895
Sledding is awesome

1559
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:18,783
But John is also a fully grown middle-aged man and as he sat on that sled

1560
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
Waiting to

1561
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Why down the hill

1562
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,391
You realize that

1563
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,463
Always agree with grown ups

1564
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,023
Many pounds--in years later on our bodies

1565
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,607
Sweating isn't quite as exciting as it used to be

1566
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,167
You know when you're 8 10 12 years old

1567
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,239
Which did John didn't seem fair or right

1568
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,311
Sledding should be fun for everyone in besides

1569
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,639
This seems like a problem waiting to be solved

1570
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:49,247
Which worked out great because John happens to be a professor of product design

1571
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,063
So that afternoon he decided to

1572
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,463
He got his notepad and take some notes we noticed that a lot of kids like to run and jump onto their

1573
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
Their sleds

1574
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
Trying to get a little bit more speed and in a lot of them would do it running and then kneeling on their sled as they go down and hitting

1575
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,495
Jumpsuit things like that while that was terribly uncomfortable for us as adults

1576
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
That kind of got the wheels turning a little bit

1577
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:19,455
The wheels started turning and Sean got in touch with a group of friends who also love to solve design problem

1578
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:25,855
He shared his notes with the team and he has to figure out a way to make sledding more comfortable

1579
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
And more fun

1580
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,791
Pictures for kids but for grown-ups to one of the team members said was hey I think we could really make this

1581
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
A little bit more exciting

1582
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:39,167
If we created two independent sleds and strapped into our legs

1583
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
Two sleds

1584
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
Strapped to your legs

1585
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:46,079
I like the pads a hockey goalie might wear but instead of pads

1586
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,943
Baby sleds so John and his buddies decided to pursue this idea

1587
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,343
They pulled together about $20,000 each and got to work the first prototype was actually

1588
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,671
Kind of like a foam-filled sled that was cut in half

1589
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:06,303
And duct tape to somebody's legs just to see if it were possible to have two independent

1590
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
Legs

1591
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:11,679
With something underneath thumb track and stay straight down a hill

1592
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
Possible but

1593
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
Not that simple so for the next model John made a hard plastic shell to fit over the

1594
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,175
Lower legs screwed some straps to it and then

1595
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:27,295
Cut up some yoga mats and stuck dots on the inside just to get a little bit of cushion

1596
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
Yeah you laugh but when you're my age that matters

1597
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,695
Dispersion did move better on the snow but

1598
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
Now John needed to make the sleds more comfortable without losing that agility the phone was kind of the key

1599
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,887
The ingredients all this

1600
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
There's an impact

1601
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,567
Energy absorbing foam that goes into it that sort of raises your feet up in the back and really makes it possible

1602
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
To go down the hill and pick up some Speed without totally dragging your feet the whole way at this point John needed feedback

1603
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,807
Design so he got his friends his kids and his neighbor's kid

1604
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,087
Did try them out

1605
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:07,487
You know we heard really straightforward things like I really like how I can run in

1606
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,303
And slide on them it helps me go faster

1607
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,703
I like how I can walk up the hill and I have to carry my sled up by the next winter 2016

1608
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,519
Team was ready to sell their product

1609
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,615
The use of their money for advertising and they ended up selling 800 units

1610
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,407
It was time to celebrate

1611
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
But

1612
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,503
About two days after that big shipment

1613
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,391
We hit this local ski hill all the founders put on a pair jump went down the hill

1614
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,695
And half of them broke

1615
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
I'm the very first run

1616
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:45,887
Thank God for the beer because that probably made it a little bit more tolerable we discovered what the problem was but

1617
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
Man it sure didn't feel good at all the problem was the straps they weren't properly attached

1618
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:59,199
2 Team grab the beer and left the hill and spent an entire night troubleshooting and after a few days

1619
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,759
They sent customers of follow-up shipment

1620
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,599
You had better Fasteners and instructions on how to attach them

1621
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
And they also started gearing up for the next winter

1622
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:13,023
The Tweet the sled design and the added a smaller size for little kids

1623
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,351
So when the 2017 season rolls around

1624
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:20,191
We sold 8000 units we actually sold out

1625
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,799
Jabroni

1626
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,639
