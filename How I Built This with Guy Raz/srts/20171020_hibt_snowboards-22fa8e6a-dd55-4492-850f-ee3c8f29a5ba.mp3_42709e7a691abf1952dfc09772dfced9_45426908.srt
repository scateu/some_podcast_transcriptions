00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
I mean I was like Willy Loman and I was a traveling salesman that I would

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Load up my car it was a Volvo Wagon at the time but I remember once going out with

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
38 doors and I drove around New York State and visited dealers and I went out with 38 I came home with 40

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,544
40 support because one guy had given me to bag that he bought and said this is a joke

9
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Brown NPR how I built this

Innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movement

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
How did Jake Carpenter turned a childhood novelty toy into one of the biggest winter sports in the world

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,728
Burton Snowboards

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
So imagine being on an airplane in 1977

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,368
You sit down you strike up a conversation with the guy sitting next to you you ask him what he does

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,464
Because something like I make sleds for the snow except

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
You standing there

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Skateboard

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,888
You have no idea what he was describing you couldn't have imagined that it was in

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
What are years

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,752
Snowboarding would become a multibillion-dollar industry

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
And if that person next to you or Jake Burton Carpenter

22
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,432
There's no way you've predicted that one day

23
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
One out of every three snowboards sold worldwide

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,624
Would be a Burton Snowboard and not because he invented the sport he didn't

25
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
There's probably no one on earth who did more to popularize it

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
And it didn't happen overnight

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,352
10 years after Jake founded Burton Snowboards

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Fewer than 7%

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
Ski resorts even allowed snowboarding

30
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
It's hard to find one that doesn't

31
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,664
Anything about Burton is it didn't just build snowboards

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Celtic culture around snowboarding

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Culture

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,088
It was inspired in part by Family ski trips to Vermont

35
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Glenn Jacobs

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,464
My dad sort of figured I might be something fun for a family to do

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
When I was around I guess

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,328
Seven or eight and he would take the whole family

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
I just always had this attachment

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
Just know I mean I

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Tamia with mint no school and

42
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
Still my favorite thing to do in life is go up to my kids rooms and

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Those days are behind me but

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Time to get up for school and then after they get up elements of snow day

45
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Winter in 1966 there was a brief craze across parts of America foreign

46
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Novelty toy called the snurfer

47
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,280
As in snow + surf was basically a stand-up slide that

48
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
You could ride down a hill

49
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,424
And a carpenter was one of the thousands of kids who bought one

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Pretend box

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
It was a 4 ft long piece of wood that was about six or seven inches wide

52
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
And there ain't no edges

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
You stood on it on these sort of

54
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,736
Staples it gave you traction and yet a rope attached to the nose

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
It was a little bit like you were riding a bucking bronco just getting down the hill

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
But it was fun

57
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
And I

58
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
Brunswick made them they sold 800000 or something like that

59
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
But it developed a sort of called

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
In a positive sense of the word

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Nike friends and

62
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
We would do it together and we would modify them

63
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
For me

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Misinterpret was the opportunity

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Who's basically surfing on snow

66
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Surfing on snow

67
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
Not always Jake's childhood was

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
Pretty great even idyllic

69
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
But then when he was about 13

70
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Things started to unravel

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Jake's older brother George

72
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
Was killed in battle in Vietnam

73
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
And a few years later

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
His mother died as well

75
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
And for Jake

76
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
It was a pretty tough time

77
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
He even ended up getting expelled from his

78
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Is boarding school

79
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
I mean I was

80
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Wiseass

81
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
And when I was young

82
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Victoria Falls

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
End

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
When I got kicked out of

85
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
Brooks was a school and I went up to see the Headmaster

86
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Who was the Headmaster one

87
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
My father was

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
And when my brother was there

89
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
It was brewed on me and my dad made me get in the car and go 5 hours see this guy and you know for a 5-minute conversation

90
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,279
And then a long drive home and that is when I decided to turn my life around and start

91
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Applying myself to whatever the hell I did

92
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,727
Did apply himself by figuring out how to take what he was good at

93
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
And make money

94
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Jake's first century was a small Landscaping

95
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
And then after college

96
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
He went to work for an investor in Manhattan

97
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
In the back of his mind

98
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
Never forgot about the snurfer

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Annabelle

100
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
Potential to be something much

101
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Much bigger

102
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Yai

103
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
Really from the very beginning of Surfing for me

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
I saw it as

105
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Something that could be

106
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Developed

107
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
And I was sure the project was going to do it or somebody

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
And nothing happen

109
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
But you know

110
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,151
In the back of my mind I always knew it could be as forward and I didn't have a business plan for a site but I did the math that

111
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
If I can make 50 snowboard today I can make $100,000 a year

112
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
And that would be

113
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Awesome

114
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
You thought

115
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
I'm going to I can do something in the thing to do is

116
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Makeup much better Surfer

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Yeah make money on it

118
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
So I started the company in 77

119
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
And because you were living in Manhattan

120
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
The time right yes and I made my first

121
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,543
Prototypes in my apartment on the Upper East Side 80s

122
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Shop in your apartment in like

123
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,175
People selling stuff in or I was just clueless then as you are now

124
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
I did not know how to do it I was a loser in shop class in school

125
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
Like my napkin holder was by far the ugliest for the worse

126
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
And so there I was with a saber saw on

127
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
In my apartment making them

128
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Like out of what

129
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
Yeah I'd avoid the very first I was modifying some Surfer

130
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
First ever round and then

131
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
I said I got to move to Vermont

132
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Midas company

133
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
We not going to start a snowboard company

134
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Manhattan

135
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
So I left my job in New York City in

136
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Like early

137
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
December at the Old Winter is here and I start a landscaping business

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
When do we spring

139
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Start Reiki at 1 tonight

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
I had a car station wagon a narrative in the family on

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Fox garbage bags a couple of rakes

142
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
That's what I started like landscape business with

143
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Manufacturing is a lot tougher than

144
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Mowing lawn

145
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
But I thought okay it's winter now it's time to start the company I almost missed the next

146
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
Literally it took so long to develop a product

147
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Annabelle

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
You finance

149
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Get the money

150
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Well my

151
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Because my mother died

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
Young age when my grandmother died

153
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,271
She had some dough and instead of going to my mother came to

154
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Play my two sisters

155
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
And so I inherited almost $200,000

156
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
150 of it

157
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Developing Burton

158
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
So

159
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Your middle name is Burton

160
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Yes

161
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Carpenter so why did you call the

162
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Mr. Borges compass

163
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
I just always had this

164
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Interest

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
And the guy was named after

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
John house Burton and I

167
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Doctor

168
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Burton was a

169
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Cooler name

170
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
And I wanted the name of Bohr's I mean boards was part of the name was Burton boards

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
And then I

172
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
Drove down to Montpelier Vermont unincorporated went to the

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
We so cold that all the paperwork and everything was a big moment for me

174
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
Incorporation

175
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,583
Or maybe Burton boards I sort of did

176
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Some form of

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Trademark

178
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
Petechiae next to Android n

00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Yeah everything official

180
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
So you okay see you you moved to Vermont and then to start the singing and then

181
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
What was your next step

182
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
Yeah so I went to this company called

183
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Shushan Bentwood company and they made

184
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,879
Curved wood for people that made furniture out of solid Ash

185
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,999
So my first prototype was a piece of solid Ash that was just put in this thing to curve the nose

186
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
And then I

187
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Just start writing

188
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
The money outside literally made a hundred

189
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
But all those under prototypes they weren't all solid wood I got onto laminated wood vertically laminated at haar's

190
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Bodily laminated like

191
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Why would I went to a friend too

192
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
Live in California who had a surfboard company

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
And they would let me make boards in their Factory at night

194
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
And I would take a surfboard blank which is

195
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Six or seven feet long and maybe three or four inches thick and by the morning I have little to think down to us

196
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,375
Snowboard and they were just these guys were so cool but they laughed at me went to these

197
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,007
Factory you said I need you to give me this curved piece of water that needs a Betrayal Knows

198
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
What is a 4 what would you

199
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,359
You tell them I'm in the store for there was some awareness

200
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
It has been around

201
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
So I was telling him that I was

202
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Making a modern rendition of an

203
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
And I always feared that like the minute

204
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Ski companies caught wind of this then

205
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
They would just jump on and I'll be out of his

206
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Nobody cares

207
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Nobody cares

208
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
And it wasn't just you like

209
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
With this thing like

210
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Messing around on Hills

211
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Dude I was so alone yet

212
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
Wow did you ever come across people like what

213
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
What is that

214
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
What are you doing yes it was

215
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
To the point

216
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,311
Literally if I wasn't implying something to ask me what I did I would make something

217
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Cuz it was just too

218
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
Embarrassing

219
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,015
I concept of snowboarding wasn't something that it would be like saying today

220
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Yeah yeah

221
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Hybrid cloud

222
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
Like that's my job I make skateboards for cloud skateboarding for sure

223
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
At what

224
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Point where you able

225
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
How to say I got it I've got this is the one I'm going to make

226
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
I hadn't thought about this in a long time but

227
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
I remember that specific moment on Mount Washington

228
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
In June

229
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,639
And you can hike up Mountain you know that you know would have been June of 78

230
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,503
And I'm hiking up there and Hillman's Highway was the trail and I had to board

231
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Orwell just testing the final

232
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
Past and it was horizontally laminated

233
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
Rock Maple very much like Escape

234
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
What's better and more flexible

235
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
And I wrote

236
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Down you know just hiking up Logan right is like okay

237
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
And then I've decided on the construction now so I go out and I

238
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Rent this place that's going to be this little

239
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Serta Factory

240
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
And I hire to relatives

241
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
And a friend

242
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
To help me

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Take these pieces of

244
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Kirkwood and

245
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Shape them

246
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,183
Drill them paint them with fins on the mat on them with bindings on them

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
It was a long process and we

248
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
As I said my original plan was to make 54 today that was always sort of my goal because you thought that they were just going to this is going to blow

249
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Blow up it was you were going to need

250
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
I majored in economics

251
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Call Ajay

252
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Classes with

253
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
Nobel Prize winners but I don't know if I really understood supply and demand

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Digital shop

255
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
In Londonderry Vermont with Burton boards written on the front of it and big letters who are the kinds of people who work on

256
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Coming into your shop

257
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
In Londonderry

258
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Vermont

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Yeah it wasn't

260
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
People

261
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Out for a walk

262
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Buying a snowboard in

263
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
We didn't sell any Wheat made me a few t-shirts but

264
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Are most people found out about us that would come there and

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,895
People we would advertise in the skateboard magazines in a little bit and ski magazine to spend some money there I mean I

266
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Because there were these pockets

267
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,039
Around the country in Michigan and Arizona are these places were people

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Head surf

269
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
And like me and they sort of stuck with it and they got it they understood it

270
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
That first year

271
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
What kind of feedback are you getting from people

272
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
Who bought them today love it they were day like this is going to change the world

273
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
Yeah it was

274
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
I mean I was

275
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Like Willy Loman and I was a traveling salesman and I would

276
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Load up my car

277
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
It was a Volvo Wagon at the time and I remember once going out with

278
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,855
38 Star Wars and I drove around New York State and visited dealers and I went out with 38 I came home with 40

279
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,463
Tortie snowboard because one guy has given me to back that he bought and said

280
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
No One Is Your Love

281
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Pua would visit ski shops

282
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Bicycle shops yeah that was my first

283
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
And then ultimately

284
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
You know some

285
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Surf shops in

286
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
It was in the beginning

287
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
Skateboard shop surf shop ski shops nobody wanted any part of it

288
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,919
Did you have more you discouraged off my first year did you think maybe this is not going to work maybe I should

289
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Just cut bait

290
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
Yeah I had some I had a few days it was tough

291
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Getting out of bed

292
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Just motivating

293
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Myself

294
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
All day long

295
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
And you're all by yourself

296
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Yeah

297
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
And I am like I'm an emotional guy and you know you having lost

298
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
People wanting

299
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Always happen

300
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
So I had to let go of

301
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
My chihuahua doesn't my friend very quick

302
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
And it became

303
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Back to me

304
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
And you're too because we made enough boards

305
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
In that first winter I don't know what are we made of

306
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
1050

307
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
We made an effort

308
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
Three years just sitting here but yeah they're pretty much done

309
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
So I had one high school kid helping me out

310
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Part-time and now is it

311
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
How many boards

312
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
First year was 300 or 350 second-year with 700 I member one day and

313
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
That second winner of selling

314
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Packing up the 700 Sport and thinking

315
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Wow that's

316
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
You know that's over doubling

317
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
So what happens

318
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Between that first year in a second

319
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
When you go from

320
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Three hundred two seven hundred

321
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Why why did you double

322
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
The number for

323
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Was it just

324
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Black

325
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
Bossier who is just getting out there Word of Mouth

326
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
I mean marketing

327
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
You know advertising placing ads in these

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
Ski Surfer skateboard mags

329
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
I mean I remember going to check the mailbox cuz dealers really weren't that interested in you know

330
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Stores

331
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,223
And so we would send out these brochures right from your one we had brochures and

332
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
We would send them out with a little male or four minutes

333
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
And I would go to get the mail every day and I remember looking in the mailbox and would be like you

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Nothing

335
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
Couple of envelopes or Sunday there be 5 or 6 envelopes

336
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
And then you open up the thing and that is cruel order form and you can get it

337
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
You'd open up the envelope it'll be

338
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
County t-shirts or something

339
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
And then you'd open up an envelope would be like

340
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
For sale boards for a family in Connecticut I mean

341
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,407
I can remember it so clearly Could you actually use them

342
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
I'm assuming you couldn't

343
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Take it to ski resort and just go down

344
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
Mountain nobody was presented

345
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
I mean

346
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
Skiing at the time was 20 bucks a day and it was a lot of money so this was an opportunity to

347
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
Express yourself and have fun out and do with friends and

348
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
It was

349
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
A cheap way to have a lot of fun when it's snowing

350
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
You could not

351
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Going to Resort

352
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
And to be honest

353
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
I didn't start as a resort

354
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
You didn't tear

355
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
No it wasn't that wasn't it was like

356
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
A low-cost alternative to

357
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
But then these kids

358
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
Then I started to hiring more

359
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
Maybe you're 3 to what

360
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Did you help

361
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,279
Assemble these boards put them in boxes and get them out of the door still doing all the assembly in that place in Vermont yes

362
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
And hand

363
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Yeah they were just help me get the board out the door

364
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
This one was or Cromwell you could drive up to this Village that was

365
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
What are the way up the mountain

366
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
So we would buy one of the car drive up to the Village

367
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Everybody would

368
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
If there are four of us

369
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
One guy would stay in the car the other three would snowboard down the hill

370
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
And that would meet at the bottom and do it again and again and then ultimately

371
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
Snowcat drivers would give us rides and

372
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Bribe snowcat drivers the six-pack or something you up to a point off of the Moon

373
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
It was so challenging to ride those boards

374
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
People now they have these vintage races naked on

375
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,287
Also work tonight for the life of me don't get it I mean it's you know

376
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Hard but

377
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,895
It was just easy on rebellious I mean

378
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,503
What snowboarding and Burton did as we revolutionized

379
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Winner

380
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Life and honor

381
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
This was the beginning of it

382
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
When when this thing

383
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Please turn to take off

384
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Well I mean in terms of this

385
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
Sports or my company I mean it was nothing

386
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
I think in the

387
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
Now in the context

388
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Starting a business people think of

389
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,639
Internet companies in Costa Mesa blow then they wanted there just was not

390
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
A defining moment in the context of

391
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
The sport blowing up I mean they were big Milestones along the way and

392
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Take time with cordless

393
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
Calling it the worst new sport

394
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah that would have been

395
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Early 80s

396
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
And now

397
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Part of that time

398
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
The worst new sport was they said it was more about raging hormones and this was his rebellious young man

399
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
Bet we're making it happen and then

400
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Cool girls

401
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Very courageous

402
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Women

403
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Got into it and started doing it

404
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
And I realized okay

405
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
We're not

406
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Going to lose any more money

407
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
We might not make money but I can you know manage

408
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Manage this financially

409
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Play so

410
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
It just

411
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Grew and grew and grew but at a manageable pace

412
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
Why didn't ski resort allow snowboarders

413
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
In the beginning

414
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Well it was

415
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
There was a

416
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:21,311
Actually famous cases Stratton which was Resort when the first Resorts lettuce and where this guy at Stratton

417
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
It's in southern Vermont

418
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
And that this guy

419
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Broken his leg because of some

420
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Sign or something skiing

421
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
Annies through the mountain and I think he tried to get

422
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
Definitely got a million dollars

423
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
So there was this liability

424
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
There's this

425
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Paranoia about

426
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Getting sued

427
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
That's all that was their fear but

428
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
They ultimately would give us a chance that we would lobby with them and their kids sometimes out than we would Lobby Reserve

429
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,287
Shorts and then if a big Resort like that and then probably had to come along and Magic Mountain

430
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
It took years

431
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
But it was there was no stopping it

432
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,551
Also I guess start identify

433
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,111
People who are really good snowboarders and and

434
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Sponsor them

435
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,511
Yeah we'll for a minute there these kids at work for me just happened to be

436
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
The best and then

437
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,703
There was a rider Greg Kelly who actually wrote for this company since you started making snowboards after we did but they

438
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
Pretty well-known skateboard company and this guy Craig Kelly wrote for them but we were good friends that always.

439
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
Old Gregg

440
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
You ever had the opportunity

441
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
We would love for him to ride for us

442
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,623
And then Sims ultimately sold his company to bigger skateboard company

443
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,999
And so we got a deal anymore for me and I paid him $17,000 a year

444
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,863
And this guy was Greg Kelly was a godson all Wheaties Birds

445
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,935
He was very impressed with all over his

446
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Yes

447
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
So having him

448
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Represent

449
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
That was my pretty transformation

450
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
It was beyond Transformers

451
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Cuz you're out all of a sudden not only

452
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Give this advertisement

453
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
But you got the coolest

454
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
And the best guy

455
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
You can do all this

456
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Cool Staffing

457
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
You got kids singing this

458
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Well

459
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,719
I want to try this and I guess Burton's the way to go cuz this guy uses Burger

460
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
You know what that's

461
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Pretty much it

462
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Craig made the sport cool and the brand cool

463
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
When did Emmylou a snowboarding start to get bigger

464
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
The ski companies must have thought well

465
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
There's money to be made

466
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
K2 and rationality

467
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,383
Did they start to make snowboards

468
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
It's just so funny that the ski company

469
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
We're so

470
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
What was going on in

471
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Front of their eyes

472
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
I mean

473
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Talk about

474
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Close minded

475
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
You know

476
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
Ask you earlier, I could have destroyed us anywhere all these

477
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
Rumors that some cucumbers going to start making in the neck

478
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
We went from being

479
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
In a fly in the windshield

480
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
All of a sudden

481
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
We became a threat

482
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
In just a minute had Jake dealt with the competitors

483
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:10,271
Now wanted a piece of the action play with this guy Rising you're listening to how I built this from NPR

Early days for Jay Carpenter

496
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:37,312
Building Burton and at the same time trying to build the whole sport of snowboarding

497
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Sometimes lonely

498
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,200
Because he stuck with it because the sport car

499
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,296
The big ski companies as you can imagine started to notice

500
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
And all of a sudden the market for snowboards

501
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Wenzhou lonely anymore

502
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
Okay so when when the big ski company started to to make snowboards

503
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
What happened to you guys well

504
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,192
By the time they started making a weird maybe on the 3rd of the resorts

505
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
Ndk

506
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
They didn't want the sport to happen right I mean these

507
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
He companies did not want sovereignty succeed

508
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
So snowboarders didn't like ski company

509
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,016
I mean people did perceive them as not being the real deal

510
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,160
And we didn't keep that a secret I mean we made it pretty damn clear that we were the real deal and

511
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
What day did

512
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,280
Have manufacturing ability and some of those French and Austrian companies were

513
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
Subsidized by the government

514
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
To keep their factories going

515
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,704
So, cost perspective they were lower-cost producer

516
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
For a minute there

517
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
But it was just they were too late

518
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
They missed the boat

519
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Did you ever have

520
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
A stubborn really begin to take off in the

521
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
In the early 90s

522
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
Did you ever face serious threats from competitors either big or small

523
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,696
Well it was always like any early days was a rivalry between bird and Simsbury

524
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
We've doubled the number of snowboards sold

525
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
For the first 20 years I think of the

526
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
So

527
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
Sims with red one point K2

528
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Was somewhat of a thread

529
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Got more aggressive earlier on

530
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
But now we've been

531
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
We've been the number one

532
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Manufacturer

533
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Snowboards since

534
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
The day I

535
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Did you

536
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
You know what I mean even though you

537
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Had this market share near the soil customer base

538
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
He's had a lot more money to work with

539
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
And you were

540
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Your money was coming from sales

541
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Yeah I know ultimately we were borrowing money from Banks

542
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
It was very secure

543
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
And then

544
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
We would get bigger and bigger and obviously we're doubling our sale so we're doubling the money that we need in the bank and you need some money

545
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
The money for marketing and for what we needed the money to make the snowboards because in this industry and ski

546
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
We didn't start this

547
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
But you do shipping the stuff and whatever August

548
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
September

549
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
And then you don't get paid until

550
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
December game

551
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
So it was always working capital we never needed long-term debt

552
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
But we've always had this need for working capital

553
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,632
Until we would work with these Vermont Banks and we'd get up to a certain level is have like three times

554
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
And then we get those are lovely so you know this

555
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Maybe a bad we're going to bail

556
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Never cuz we were late on a payment or

557
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
Tell me about

558
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
Young people money that we owe them

559
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
But they just sort of figured you know this has been a good ride we're going to

560
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,272
Bail and then we go to a bigger bank and then a bigger bag and then

561
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
We borrow we still borrow some working capital but it has

562
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Become less and less

563
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
At any point did you think about

564
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
Going public doing IPO

565
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,352
Seeking venture-capital outside investors

566
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Anything like that

567
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
Yeah interesting way

568
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,752
There was this one company called ride

569
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
And they started out

570
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
And then a guy that work for us went to work 4th Avenue sort of a mid-level manager everything was a competing snowboarding company

571
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,016
Convenience towing company you want to work for them and then they went public

572
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Can they at a very low price

573
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
And the stock went up to

574
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
It's split and then we're up to

575
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
35 box with up to 70 on it

576
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Non-supportive valuation

577
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,352
Which was a millionaire all of a sudden and I felt this

578
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
Enormous

579
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Amount of pressure

580
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
Like I taking care of my people and yeah I bet and like

581
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
Just am I doing the right thing here until I went and I met

582
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
With

583
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
A couple of big

584
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
New York

585
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,456
Investment Banking firms and I

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Just couldn't deal.

587
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
The Bible I just feel like this is not us

588
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
And then all of a sudden

589
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Right stock

590
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Which was it 35 bucks at the time went down to

591
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
2 Box

592
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
Because they have these expectations that

593
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
Like Wall Street just they take things and they

594
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Project

595
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Unrealistic

596
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Expectation

597
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,984
So ultimately people have realized

598
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
Working for a privately held company

599
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,616
Has many many advantages

600
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,248
I guess it was in like 98 that snowboarding became an Olympic sport

601
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
You I know that you don't like to

602
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
Say this to you tonight but

603
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,256
You are widely credited as the guy who really made snowboarding what it is and

604
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
This is became an Olympic sport

605
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
What did you

606
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,960
Think when that happened like that must have been a pretty amazing moment

607
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
It was

608
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Not

609
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,872
Cool moment at all

610
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,784
That was not the answer I was expecting what happened well

611
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Spell switches

612
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
International ski Federation

613
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Swiss

614
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
You know whatever governmental body and 8

615
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
I'm control the scene and then they started having snowboard competition

616
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
When they just said

617
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Aside from the ski races and we were wondering what they were up to

618
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,776
And then they just arbitrarily decide okay snow is going to be the Olympics I mean they didn't even give me a phone call they never

619
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
How old is anyting

620
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
I

621
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Will take credit for pioneering

622
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
You would think

623
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
But you might

624
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
Pick up the phone and tell that person what you're up to or

625
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
How do you think we should do this

626
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:11,648
None of that they just arbitrarily it's like the baseball player that finds out he's traded when he reads in the newspaper

627
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
And then I go to the Olympics

628
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,024
We've got our team there that I get to the venue

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,912
And they got snowboarding misspelled at the venue how do you spell it well you spell it with a W snowboarding

630
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,264
Today at snro - boarding is in Nagano Japan alike

631
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Not a good sign

632
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Right so

633
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
And then they proceeded to have the

634
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
The racing thing was

635
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Heart condition

636
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
And then

637
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Decide it was a

638
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Driving rainstorm

639
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
And they said okay we can have the

640
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
Monsanto we would never have this

641
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Prestigious P event in the rainstorm

642
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
But they can go they can get

643
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,840
Risk life and limb and not be wearing goggles it's raining so hard

644
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
And so

645
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
But nonetheless

646
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
They've gotten

647
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,288
Better and they're doing a better and better job in The American or emits a form of

648
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
National Association

649
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,176
They care about this morning I've got some people to care about the sport they're trying to do better but

650
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
The last Olympics the venues

651
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
For the freestyle stuff which is what people care about

652
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
For the half pipe and slopestyle that the Bengals have been

653
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Really

654
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
As your company grew

655
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
Describe the culture of the temp

656
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Was it I mean

657
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,936
I'm looking at you right now and I cannot imagine you ever wearing a suit and tie

658
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,824
And being like a boardroom boss like like where do you have your

659
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
Meetings with your top tmall

660
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,712
What are meetings you know you look at my office

661
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
It's

662
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
3 sofas and

663
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
Two chairs in a coffee table and there's no desk

664
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
Senior conference room where we have our board meetings itself has

665
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Put your feet up

666
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Bring your dog to work day

667
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,840
132 registered dogs are between always heard of

668
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
Keep track of the number and

669
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
It's

670
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Resembles snowboarding

671
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Lifestyle

672
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
Edward tribe n we

673
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,688
Are so focused on the sport everybody in that cup you know damn near everybody that company snowboard

674
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,016
And cuz that's our source of energy that's where you recharge your batteries

675
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
And he was like

676
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,904
Jake I'm going to be in late today. Snowboarding

677
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
It's Scott

678
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Pretty much

679
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
The Dramamine if it snows over two feet it's an automatic

680
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,584
Day off at all company

681
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
And last year they were

682
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
3 of those days which is almost too nice I mean I like people to work to I'm not

683
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,104
It sucks but people come in late and work late

684
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
You know people work hard there so that's

685
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
As long as people are giving us a solid effort I get it if they want to get up there and catch a few runs on.

686
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,696
You're a your wife Donna

687
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
She she actually at some point became

688
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,304
Took over as it as a Company CEO right

689
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Yeah

690
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
And what's what story

691
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
Well she came

692
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
And went and then she was

693
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,288
CFO for a while this is in your early days and then

694
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
When we had kids she backed off some she wasn't working as much then and then when the financial crisis

695
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Which was really Roger Clyne

696
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
The big one

697
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Lehman Brothers All That

698
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
It you guys

699
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Well

700
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
The bank

701
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,768
Charge this 4 million dollars to change one paragraph

702
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
A&R loan agreement

703
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Which was call The Covenant when you're borrowing money

704
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,472
Your earnings had to represent a certain ratio compared to how much money or borrowing

705
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
And we

706
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Slipped on that one

707
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
It was a very tough year

708
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
And we weren't losing money we were making money

709
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
But literally they said well you broke his coming in so

710
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
You're going to pay a $4000000 fee

711
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
And that

712
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
Boy I mean

713
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
With the right people off

714
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,232
We weren't making the money that we had been I so we had a recession

715
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Yes exactly

716
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:05,120
But you know what it's always been a youth Rivermark and it's kids at I mean people would buy

717
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
Two or three snowboards a year

718
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Can you look at

719
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
Italy or Spain to very big markets for us

720
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,384
And the unemployment rate amongst people under 20 was 50%

721
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
It was a very tough

722
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Stop time

723
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
Through this process

724
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Of this

725
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
Crisis and I think it's not unique to burn

726
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Art

727
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Company culture what kind of got

728
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Destroyer

729
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
Well I think a lot of people

730
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
Wood

731
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Blame other people

732
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
4 things

733
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Negative things

734
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
Is there a happening in there would be finger-pointing and

735
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
The culture of our company

736
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
Was messed up and at the same time

737
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
I felt

738
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
You're no women in our top manager

739
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
And that

740
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
Felt wrong to me so

741
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,112
I got in there are night and Donna came along with me and

742
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,440
At that level we were running the company and I brought her and

743
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Serta specifically that

744
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Help with the culture and get

745
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
More women

746
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
In leadership positions at Burton

747
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
When you see the culture I mean I'm just trying to get in

748
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Through the innuendo

749
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,776
Is it wasn't like British was it like

750
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,848
Male solo Macho was it like

751
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,664
In what was the thing you want to change

752
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Well

753
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
I mean you're not happy when

754
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
You're being managed by

755
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Feeder

756
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Or

757
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
For you

758
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
Instill fear in yourself that you're going to lose your job or

759
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
It's just you need to make people

760
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
People have to understand

761
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
When and why

762
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Stuff happen

763
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
Were you responsible for any of that

764
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Friday events

765
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Fear-based up

766
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Well I think

767
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
Many of the people that were

768
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,688
In and around it and I think that

769
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,040
We were all responsible to answer I said I mean I don't think that's ever been a

770
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
Tactic that I've used hopefully

771
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,416
But I certainly let it happen under my nose

772
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
Do you think that that you have a hard time

773
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
With criticism

774
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
And I said because you know

775
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,400
It it didn't really problematic right if you're unwilling to listen to somebody

776
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
It says listen I know you built this thing

777
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
But I'm trying to make it better listen to me

778
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
No that's

779
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
Couldn't be more true but last

780
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,176
And less and less every year I mean I did every job and I come

781
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
IMEI made

782
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
The first Ford

783
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
And for a while there I mean we might have had

784
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
50 employees and I was convinced

785
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
In a bragging way but I could do anybody's job

786
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Better than naked

787
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,280
But that's not the case anymore you know we've been Engineers now that I don't even

788
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
Have a hard time having a conversation

789
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
But

790
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
I got better at it

791
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
And I had the sense to

792
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
Surround myself with people

793
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Where

794
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Better

795
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Things

796
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Then I am but I'm not good at it

797
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
That's been good and I've learned

798
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
To delegate

799
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,064
That's not an easy thing to learn how to do specially when you're detail-oriented learn to let go like that

800
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
You have to trust

801
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
Beyond trusting you have to let him screw up

802
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,024
Can live with it and live through mistakes and if they repeat the mistakes and that's not

803
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Burton's made everything

804
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Mistake in the Box

805
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
But I don't think we made too many

806
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,056
Why can I'm sure at certain points you were offered money to buy

807
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
I just didn't take those phone calls

808
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
I mean you could I mean

809
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,968
You could have sold this company

810
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
You know Ben like a philanthropist and

811
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,880
I don't know I'm messing with a better life for sounds pretty cool it's like a pretty great life

812
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Well I

813
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
For a long time if people ask me that question I would say well

814
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
I think I become a couch potato on

815
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,888
Egyptian watch SportsCenter

816
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
So you don't snowboard funny but

817
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,544
I mean it's the best job in the world why would I ever walk away from it that's

818
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
Selfishly admittedly

819
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
That's always

820
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,528
Part of it and I think they were doing a great job and we're humming along if we were

821
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Really struggling

822
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
I might be more appropriate for me to look at that more

823
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Seriously

824
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Important is money to you

825
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
Is being rich to you

826
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
Well to be brutally honest

827
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
I mean I

828
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
Enjoy having

829
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
Eligibility financial aid

830
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,104
We're going surfing for a week in the Maldives next week my all family

831
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,944
And we're going to have a speedboat it's going to take us to the lineup and

832
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,016
It's going to be epic and the stuff that cheap

833
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,856
So I love that and I would be a liar if I told you I didn't

834
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
But it's not the most important thing in life

835
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
Yeah

836
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,792
You're a really tough couple years and

837
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Your chest

838
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Now

839
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Internet recovery of it

840
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
ENT surgery

841
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
I guess in 2015

842
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
And then and then before that you had

843
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Heart surgery

844
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Bright

845
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
And then you

846
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Battled cancer

847
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Testicular cancer

848
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Yeah

849
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
An idea what the whole process of chemotherapy which is

850
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Dreadful

851
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
And then

852
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,904
Tell Linda that I was in a plane and I had a pulmonary embolism which

853
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Really

854
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Still

855
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Affects me

856
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
And then I came down with that

857
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
Miller Fisher that form of gamma ray

858
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
Miller Fisher because

859
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
A lot of people know about this but

860
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
It's

861
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
I guess it's an autoimmune disease that can make you temporarily

862
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Paralyzed

863
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
So

864
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Like what was that

865
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
What was going on like

866
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Why did you even discover

867
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
What was going on

868
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
Well I've gotten the knee

869
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
And then I got home

870
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
And I was with the doctor the next day in

871
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
I started seeing double and and

872
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
I told him that he's like

873
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Check it out see if

874
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Might just go away and

875
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
The next day I was seeing double

876
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
And

877
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
I felt really loud

878
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
And I wait till Donna went to work I didn't she

879
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Thank you so much

880
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
With me and

881
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
I just like and so I went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock and they

882
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Barry

883
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,528
Quickly analyze what was going on and

884
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:19,648
Within 24 hours of eating it be in there they said if you have always take you out tomorrow you won't be able

885
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
Swallow

886
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
He won't be able to open your eyes

887
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
And the next day you won't be able to breathe

888
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
And were they right

889
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
Yeah that's how it went down

890
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,776
That's what you get to the hospital and you are confined to the bed

891
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Surprise you for 6

892
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Squeaks

893
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
You couldn't move your body

894
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Hours or days

895
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
And I was there for

896
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Over 6 weeks

897
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
You're like a prisoner in your own body

898
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Yeah

899
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Very much so

900
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
I think it's like

901
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
ALS

902
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
Handstand do a couple of weeks

903
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
First of all

904
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
How did you breathe

905
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Do a ventilator

906
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
And

907
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
The ventilator was

908
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Find me

909
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Could hear it

910
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
But I couldn't see it

911
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
Did you have feeling in your body

912
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Yeah

913
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah my wife would stretch me every night

914
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Can I get certain

915
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Repeating 2

916
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Did you think you're and I

917
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
For sure

918
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Per minute

919
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
And then

920
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Can my wife did

921
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
You know she told me I was getting better

922
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
Eventually I would see these little

923
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Eye cancer

924
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Improvement

925
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
What you start to notice

926
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
You know that I could open my eyes

927
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
And that I do.

928
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,464
I was showing the physical therapy right from the get-go and then I could do something a little better than

929
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
The day before

930
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,632
And once you get to that point then it's game on. It's up to you

931
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Is that

932
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,496
Experience change the way you

933
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Live your life

934
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
And you interact

935
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
To the people you love

936
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
Well I sure as hell don't take my family for

937
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
I do live life

938
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
But the moment I mean

939
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
Much more than ever I mean I think

940
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
It happens through some

941
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't know why or how

942
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
You're dead to me

943
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
Emma's put into perspective

944
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
All yours

945
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
Success and wealth in the sink

946
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
But you built like

947
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,264
Obviously that stuff matters but like in the context of your life

948
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Nothing else

949
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Really matter

950
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
Yeah yeah that stuff could have been further from my mind

951
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,504
I think it is now though now I'm like prepared to die

952
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Really

953
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Yeah I am much more so

954
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
I could

955
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Guide

956
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
Get hit by a bus walking out of your studio and I still

957
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Luckiest guy

958
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
Because of life

959
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
If you had yes

960
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
Ever had imagined

961
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
When you were

962
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
And that first you need to fire your

963
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Employees and

964
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
That you would have built something this big

965
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,152
I had no idea that what would happen if snow bring passport

966
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
But I did not see

967
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,576
Shaun White on the cover of Rolling Stone twice or snowboarding be in the Olympics

968
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
The stuff that's happened

969
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:36,000
And it's been the athletes would have made it happen and we've facilitated it but it's been

970
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Exceeded

971
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
I wouldn't even say dreams cuz I never

972
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,656
Dreamt anything on the level that were on Now

973
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
Jake Burton Carpenter

974
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,663
By the way Burton just celebrated 40 years in business since Jake built that

975
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,527
First snowboard in the barn in Londonderry Vermont back in 1977

976
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,647

977
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047

Pay thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

992
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
So my name is Jana

993
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,775
I'm from Scarsdale New York and one day I was just so sick of opening my refrigerator and see

994
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Brown guacamole

995
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Brown in there right you scoop out the sock avocado Flash

996
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,783
Onion salt lime cilantro

997
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,647
Stick it in the fridge and then a couple hours later that bright green dip

998
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Looks

999
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
Gross this is absolutely a problem that people have and I say to them would you like a container that prevents clotting

1000
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
Guacamole from turning brown smell like

1001
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,727
Oh my God so anyway about four years ago Jane started to

1002
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
Experiment in her kitchen

1003
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,663
She made a lot of guacamole and she just started to observe that guacamole change color if I

1004
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Take some and put it in a bowl with Saran wrap it turns brown but if there was some way that I could

1005
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Eliminate

1006
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
That

1007
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
Are in that space

1008
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
Then maybe I could

1009
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,791
Sound that age-old problem to Jane recruited her step-sister to help out

1010
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:52,191
They found a designer and together they came up with a plastic container was kind of a little elevator underneath it

1011
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
It pushes the guacamole to the very top

1012
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,591
So there is no space between your guac

1013
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
In the list and then you simply

1014
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
Close the tab to cover the air hole

1015
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Put it in the refrigerator

1016
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,903
Forget about it literally forget about it I mean a week however long you're going to eat your guacamole

1017
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
Will not turn brown

1018
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,815
Okay so they have the right design but for two years they ran into one problem after another

1019
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:23,423
Are we using the wrong materials or the little elevator thing wasn't fitting properly

1020
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,287
But finally last year they got it out of the factory and into the market

1021
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
And they called it

1022
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
The guac lock

1023
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
You can lock anything up so

1024
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Tuna fish

1025
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,759
Egg salad you know chopped vegetables pesto

1026
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,599
Hummus in the more you can switch it and remove the air holes

1027
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
The better

1028
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
It's going to save

1029
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,303
Searching this is not my main problem with guacamole because

1030
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,703
With the lock your men of your kids at the guacamole so they don't eat it all before your guests cup

1031
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,287
But you're right that's a good idea that is a problem in my house

1032
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,871
That's our problem I get into the kitchen I just feel like green

1033
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:10,271
Guacamole around the mouths of my children I feel your pain could be the next iteration of the guac lock you could add a combo

1034
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,903
Nationwide like a child exactly is very funny that you said that because

1035
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,487
A lot of people say I never have leftover guacamole then why would I need this

1036
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
I would always say to them is

1037
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
Now you can make in advance

1038
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655

1049
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,527
With a dream that if we treated the news as if it were completely ridiculous

1050
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,087
It would someday become completely ridiculous

1051
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
We just kept

1052
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,975
Making rude remarks and dumb jokes eventually the world would change so that rude jokes are in fact now

1053
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
The best way to talk about it

1054
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
I'm pleased to say

1055
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
