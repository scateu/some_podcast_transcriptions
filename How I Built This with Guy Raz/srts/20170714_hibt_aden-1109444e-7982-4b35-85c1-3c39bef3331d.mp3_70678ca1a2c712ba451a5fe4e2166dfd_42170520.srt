NPR presents

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
I had read a lot of

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
Literature about women entrepreneurs and I had learned the statistic that only

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,912
2% of all women owned businesses ever break $1000000 Revenue

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Yes isn't that frightening but I'd sit myself that goal so

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,944
So I just did rot once I get to a million in Revenue I've done something that most

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
Women entrepreneurs

30
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Unable to do

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
From NPR how I built this

Tri Delta baby blanket company

00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
I'm making a hundred million dollars

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
A year

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
So back in 2013

42
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
You might remember the birth of a

43
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Brand new royal baby

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
The heir to the British throne

45
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Duchess of Cambridge has been delivered of a son

46
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
I was looking at these pictures from Buckingham Palace

47
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
Day after he was born

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,896
Mom and Dad sit outside st. Mary's Hospital in Paddington and introduced Prince George

49
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
To the world

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,016
Going to give her lungs are not Patrol Big Boys by heavy

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
And as the camera zoomed in on baby George

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
You could

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
Make out

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
He was wrapped up in a white

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Cotton swaddle

56
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Printed with

57
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Baby cartoon birds

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,216
A little internet's losing people track down the maker of that swaddle

59
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Aden & Anais

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,360
It's a baby product company that sells swaddle blankets for about 15 bucks

61
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Recipes

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
Of course the effect was instantaneous within 4 hours

63
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
The company's website crash

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
And then

65
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
Crash together next day

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
And for Aiden today's co-founder

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
It was a pretty big shock because

68
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
The company was barely seven years old

69
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
An over that seven-year.

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Aiden and the Nae had been through a lot of UPS

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Some doubts

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Starting with the recession in 2008

73
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
And then eventually

74
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,408
Traumatic breakup between Reagan and her business partner that threatened to dissolve the entire company

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,528
A company by the way with yearly Revenue now over a hundred million dollars

76
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
How did she create a company Aiden anime

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
Well the Story begins when Reagan and her husband Marcos moved from Sydney Australia to New York in

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
1997

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
After he got a job

80
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Breaking up a time

81
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
She didn't really have any plans

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
I came here without a job without a work

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
These are

84
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
And I thought you know what I'll do

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Teased off all fluids

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Spanish quiz my house

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
Husbands Chilean

88
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
And I'll fill my time that way

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
2 years instead of traded is just

90
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
You know

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,464
A new and different Journey rather than being in a hundred miles an hour with my working my study

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
And that didn't kind of workouts

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
About four months in

94
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
My husband initially was working

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
From home because

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
You know that were released

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Things out from the

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Ground

99
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Here in New York

100
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Anda

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,663
He walked into the living room and I was lying on the couch living in my pajamas you know

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
And he just said to me

103
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,087
What the hell are you doing come on you got to go to get up and shake this off and

104
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Find something to do we would you were getting depressed cuz you were bored I don't know that always.

105
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Depressed I just I didn't know anybody in New York and

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
I just sort of

107
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Fell into a rock

108
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
I think an eye

109
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
Underestimated

110
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
How

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Much I needed

112
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
To be the person that

113
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
You know I had a very

114
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Full

115
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Schedule

116
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
So rather than using the downtime

117
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Productively RJ

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
Use the downtime to lay on the couch and

119
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Watch

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Morning talk shows

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Yeah that does sound

122
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
It was it was horrible

123
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Eventually Regan's Visa did come through so she could start working and the year she landed a job as a

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Sales rep

125
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,239
For The Economist magazine that I was really good at it

126
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,127
You know the wonderful thing with Stiles is you live and die by the number that you are told to his

127
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
And I was very

128
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
Fortunate that I never didn't hit the numbers did you like it did you have fun I did

129
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Fun I

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Did I loved it was it was

131
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
Was it my passion

132
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Slightly North

133
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
And I was very frustrated that

134
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
Wasn't really taken seriously in terms of

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Being able to vape

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,983
Promoted and everything I was very much said have kept in my

137
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,823
Box of what I had always done over differ

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
An Aries

139
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
If the business over 10 years

140
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
But that was

141
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
That was a huge frustration to me that

142
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
It was obvious I was never really going to

143
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Go anywhere within the economist

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Did you like what you dreaming of leaving

145
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
And starting your own thing

146
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
I wasn't going to leave

147
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Is it for another job

148
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,423
I think I have always being an entrepreneur I never

149
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Defined myself

150
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
Is that there was always a desire for me to do something

151
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
On my own

152
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
I just never had that had an idea I've had lots

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Spidey's but none that I felt

154
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Wilwood

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
So if you know diving in the deep end

156
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
Informing at some point

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,183
You got an idea TV idea that would become aden in an a

158
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
What's

159
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
Well I had my first of my four daughters

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
That's what happened

161
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
I was pregnant with an A and always

162
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
You know you're getting ready as we all do when we are having outfits baby with all the paraphernalia that you think you need

163
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
And I went out looking for these muslin blankets that were

164
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Extremely common

165
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
Back time in Australia so common that

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
You could buy them in

167
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Uno supermarket

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,391
It was mind-blowing to me when I went looking for them in the US

169
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,231
But they didn't actually exist you couldn't find the end I guess just to explain.

170
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
To somebody who doesn't know what

171
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Muslin blankets

172
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
It's sort of like a really soft

173
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Cheesecloth

174
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,935
Yes it's it's like a goal is

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
And dumb

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Not only was it

177
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
In my opinion and still in my pee

178
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Canyon

179
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
The only thing you should wrap your baby in because

180
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
It's lightweight and breathable and big enough to be able to

181
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Securely swaddle the baby

182
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
It was the fact that this one blanket

183
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Did multiple things

184
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
You could use it as a

185
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Fitbit clock

186
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Can use it as a portable crib sheet

187
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Could use it as a nursing cover

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
You could use it as a stroller cover you could

189
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Yeah you just use it to

190
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Mopop

191
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
The message that

192
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
You know any available when you have newborn babies

193
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Is that sort of thing so

194
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
And the thing with muslin is the more you wash it the softer it gets

195
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
So in Australia this is

196
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Normal life

197
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
All babies

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
Trapped in these babies cotton muslin

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Bratz

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Yes

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
So that was

202
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
You know it and I

203
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Just thought

204
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,999
Every every Australian can't have this wrong and if I introduced

205
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Product

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
To American parents

207
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
I was just

208
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,471
Absolutely 100% certain that they would respond to it the same way as I saw these

209
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
So you

210
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Presumably took leave at Wacker and I was born

211
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
And then went back to the economist

212
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Yes

213
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
I had

214
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
3 months

215
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
End

216
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
And did you go back to the economist

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
India turning in your head

218
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
And how do you then

219
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Start to

220
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,231
Make this a reality what it was the first thing you do

221
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Well

222
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
I had no

223
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
Supply chain or operational

224
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
You know experience or knowledge, styles

225
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Ngoi Sao

226
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
I had to

227
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
Find out how I would even go about making this stuff

228
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
And that took a long time

229
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
So

230
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Had the idea in mm

231
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
3 when I was born

232
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
At at 2

233
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
It took 2 2006

234
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Work out how

235
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
To make it and and get it to Market

236
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
So did you start this process all by yourself

237
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
No I had to I had a partner

238
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
The one person that my husband knew

239
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Australia

240
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
He's best friend

241
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Girlfriend Gloria

242
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Who ended up marrying in America

243
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Can guy and that was the

244
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
The first person I met here

245
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Employer is

246
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
Aiden's mom she was the other co-founder of Aiden and Danae

247
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Wow

248
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
So you guys got together and she agreed she said that this is crazy that you can

249
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Well she had Aiden

250
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
About 7 or 8 months after I had a night

251
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
So I had been in Australia and I was

252
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Coming back

253
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
From Australia and I would

254
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Stop

255
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
And hang out with Claudia

256
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
And mock her husband

257
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
In LA to break up the

258
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
Trip and I distinctly remember sitting on Aiden

259
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Nursery

260
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Flow

261
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
And

262
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
I just did to a weenie

263
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
We need to do this Claudia live

264
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Yeah we need to find a way to my

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Happen

266
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,631
She actually said what why don't we just try and become a distributor for the company that already makes it

267
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
Hialeah

268
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Alright

269
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
And I said well why would you do that I said and I want it to be

270
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Better than what

271
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Is already available in Australia

272
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
And I I remember seeing a week

273
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
You can call the company Aiden and Danae off

274
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Did the baby

275
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
And that was sort of how it old

276
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Got started

277
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
All right just like

278
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
A logistical question

279
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Cuz you kind of had a growing sense of

280
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
How to make

281
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Start a business

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
What about the design side of it I mean

283
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Did you have

284
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Were you going to design

285
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
The blankets were you going to design the patterns in the

286
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
And the shapes are on them

287
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
That's a great question

288
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Because I am not

289
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
The mice.

290
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Person actually

291
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Jeremiah.

292
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Skills. Guy Beyond

293
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
Stick people I really can't draw to save my life

294
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
But I am

295
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
Very opinionated and I have a very

296
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Provision of

297
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
What I like

298
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Aesthetically

299
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Json

300
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Effective and I am

301
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
So Taipei

302
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
You know that

303
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
I was very much

00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055
I want these colors I want these images I want it

305
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
To look like you know and we

Freelance design

308
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
People

309
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
How to come up with our initial designs that

310
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
It launched the first product

311
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
So where did you find

312
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
The manufacturing facility how did you find somebody who

313
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
Who can make these Muslim

314
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Cotton blanket

315
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
This is actually an inch

316
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Story guy because

317
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
I was standing at the river

318
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Reception desk

319
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
At at The Economist

320
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
And the mail arrived

321
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775

324
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
So I'm sleeping through this

325
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Indonesia

326
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Who paid Judas

327
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199

328
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
An Asian

Text dolls

330
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Sourcing

331
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Trade show that was happening

332
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599

334
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
3 days

335
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Elijah

336
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
So obviously I'll wait

337
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
To that trade show

338
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
And

339
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
I walked the entire trade show with probably

340
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
4C vendors and then

341
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
I got to

342
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447

Venda

344
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Before I was about to walk out

345
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
And I woke driver and I

346
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
I'm trying to

347
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Someone that can make this

348
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Fabric

349
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Blow me

350
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Gold muslin

351
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
He said I have no idea what

352
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
But I would

353
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Drum major

354
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Manufacturing company

355
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
It in China

356
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Let me type this

357
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Back

358
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,999
And see what I say and

359
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Two weeks later I got it

360
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
An email saying we

361
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Can make this for you and that was it

362
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Show

363
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
It was literally the last

364
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Boosie went to

365
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Absolutely true

366
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Story I was

367
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Out the door by 1 booth

368
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
And they ended up

369
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Becoming my menu

370
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Affect heuristic

371
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
10 years

372
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Unbelievable

373
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
So when they they sent you the first sample

374
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Debate do they get it right right away

375
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
No

376
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
A myriad of backing

377
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,767
Enforce in terms of getting the quality to where I wanted it and

378
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
I am not

379
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
Textiles technical person I have no idea I understand the basic

380
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
6 now having beignet

381
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Assignment to use that

382
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,567
I couldn't tell them the grade of cotton I couldn't tell them the warp and weft

383
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Counts I could

384
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Couldn't tell them anything I just basic

385
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
He said

386
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
Make it like this but I need it

387
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
To be softer and then I worked

388
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Fit the factories over the years on

389
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
The way to wash it and what

390
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Put in the wash to make it

391
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Soft and obviously his mom

392
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
I wouldn't

393
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
You'd let them use anything that was in any way

394
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,423
You know they used to use formaldehyde and dies on a baby but that that stuff

395
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Play my mind so obvious

396
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Display

397
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,103
That was very important to me that there was none of that in any Iden & I products

398
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Send it was a long and laborious

399
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Process

400
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
A hell of a lot of

401
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
Failures along the way with

402
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
We had food containers

403
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Product it

404
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
When I arrived in the US

405
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
The fabric and turn yellow is so that you know there's so many stories about

406
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
The trials and tribulations of actually

407
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Perfecting the fabrication

408
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Would you

409
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
Still working at The Economist

410
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
The point yes

411
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
I stayed working at The Economist

412
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
Until May of 2009

413
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,455
Sorry did you tell your colleagues about it they find out not

414
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Nobody knew

415
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
Were you keeping it secret cuz you

416
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Did my didn't want anybody

417
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Looking

418
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Questioning

419
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
I go back to

420
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,791
I was just South post and I never ever didn't make my budget

421
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
I didn't want to walk out that door

422
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
And then have tableside will it's all good and well that she's

423
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
Created this business but it was the ethics

424
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Spencer's

425
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
The economy

426
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Yeah right

427
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
At this point I guess 2006

428
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
Nae Nae is

429
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
At 3 and then

430
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Did you have another child by that point I actually had

431
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
Three is Michael Jordan's by that point

432
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Okay so you are still working

433
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
Full-time at The Economist

434
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,047
Simply flying back and forth to LA to work with Claudia on the side business

435
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,167
And you were also raising three kids and cabbage make all of this war

436
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,239
It was really really hard

437
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
It was a conscious decision that I made

438
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
So

439
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
When I got home from I used to call The Economist my real job and I got home from the reboot

440
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
I was

441
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Well

442
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,159
In Mommy Mode and I focused on my girls and then when the girls went

443
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Bed

444
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
At 8:30

445
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
That's when I would stop my day of working on Aiden and an A and I would do that until you noticed

446
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Free City

447
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Every morning well

448
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
And because it was a conscious decision on my part I should have never

449
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
I just never really

450
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Complained about it it was what it was

451
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
So it's 2006 you have your free make your first big

452
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Order

453
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
How many what was that order like

454
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
What do you remember

455
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Well

456
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
We started we both started

457
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
Putting $15,000 in traffic

458
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Tori and

459
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
And that we

460
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
We did the minimum we had a boy pack a go pack

461
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Wattpad

462
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Towel and washcloth

463
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
And nausea

464
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Just went door-to-door

465
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
In

466
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
LA and New York

467
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
To every baby store to every you know I

468
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
I picked up the phone I called Buy Buy Baby

469
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Yeah that that was

470
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
The child school coming out in me and actually jumping ahead a bit

471
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,487
A year later the target fire calls made

472
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
Called me and said can you come in

473
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
I took in Universe excuse thinking they might take 102 and how much is a SKU

474
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Who is like one full pack so

475
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
I presented sticks for packs thinking they might take

476
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
One boy and one girl and Target

477
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Kohl's

478
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
Wow and roll it out into Old Target

479
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Stores from Taiwan

480
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Once you got orders for

481
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Police big hump

482
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
I mean you had to then make the order

483
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
With a factory in China and I guess

484
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
He's a money how did you fund

485
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
We

486
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Initially it was

487
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Wedowee

488
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Savings

489
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
And end

490
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
The money part of it was actually

491
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
What brought about the demise of

492
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
What are your my partnership I don't know if you want me to talk about that that I can because you know the pot that thing is

493
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
As always

494
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Will often a story with Entre

495

Kodi remote for very wealthy

497
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,047
Marco's 9 not so much she know we were doing fine but we didn't

498
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Have

499
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
You know millions of

500
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
So

501
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Marcus and I kept up

502
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
At Freddy's long as we could met you know we put in

503
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
15000 and we put in another

504
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
30 then we put in another 48 you know that and we kept up as long as we could until we got to a point where

505
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
We couldn't keep up anymore

506
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
There was no access to Capital you know we started the business

507
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Did the beginning of the worst

508
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Recession

509
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Great Depression

510
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Cody said we just need

511
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
To borrow money off

512
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,399
United Moc and and his family which I absolutely did not want to do it with

513
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Last Resort

514
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
But it got to the point I think we borrowed

515
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,103
100000 off career and Mark and then we borrowed another 200

516
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
50000

517
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Mark's dad

518
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
And very long story short

519
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,527
It was more marketing that was just

520
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,135
Not comfortable with the fact that in his mind they were funding the business

521
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
And

522
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
It just got

523
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,559
It just got to the point where you know I go to De mando

524
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,863
You've got 30 days to come up with this

525
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,447
Bios sad if you can't do that we have the right to

526
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
Pay you the same and if we can come to an agreement

527
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
We going to dissolve it

528
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175

555

567
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
Customer service Manufacturing

568
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
Near marketing Finance

569
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
Set my husband was helping with the finance side of

570
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
So

571
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,824
I hide one person to at least alleviate some of the work that I was

572
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Having to. Doing it

573
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,016
8:39 at night once my girls went to bed because that was also

574
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Illini

575
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
J very deeply in the sand

576
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
To myself

577
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
These little girls

578
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Did not sign on for me

579
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
Free entrepreneurial mother

580
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
But I did believe in the business

581
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
And

582
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
I went out to

583
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
A few

584
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
Of my other friends who were watching what I was

585
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Doing to raise the few hundred thousand

586
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Dollars that

587
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Laurdiy

588
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
You know wanted

589
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,200
For another work that she put into the Beast

590
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
The star Spa

591
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Fire route

592
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
To buy her out so

593
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,600
Three other people came into the business

594
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
+ 4

595
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
49% of the business for like

596
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
500000

597
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Well

598
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
This is a really important story because

599
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
We don't get to hear the story 2 off

600
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Talking about

601
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,032
Set the reality of of starting a business with a partner we're at the beginning it

602
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Their suspicion of a favicon

603
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Utopian

604
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Business and there are Partnerships that

605
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
It really works

606
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
IPhone X cases

607
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Small like this where

608
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Money gets involved in

609
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Tension builds in

610
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Can people get nervous about

611
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,000
Investment and you can kind of understand what Claudia and Mark were coming and you could I mean

612
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
I mean they were getting nervous they're worth a lot of money in the

613
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
But I mean

614
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
I have to imagine that it had

615
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
What's the toll on your friendship

616
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Who is she never spoke

617
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
To me again

618
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,152
Cuz I just responded and said clothes what are you doing breaking my heart here we can talk through this year

619
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
I was legal guardian

620
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Children that tell lies

621
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
And dumb

622
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
It was horrible

623
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
But he's horrible that you know it was

624
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
I wanted to talk to her she just in her mind it was also very looking at

625
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
I get it she was under the pressure of

626
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,704
The family and it was her marriage and all of those things so I don't I don't know I'm just

627
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
And Wyatt have

628
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Yeah it was just dumb

629
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
It was just heartbreaking that it did

630
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Did you

631
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
Did you think that the business was going to clap

632
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
I never thought that I

633
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
I thought I might collapse

634
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,136
Of i n I questioned whether or not I

635
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
Keep going because obviously it was Nick

636
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
Extremely emotional time in

637
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
But no eyes

638
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
I've never ever doubted Aiden and Danae

639
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
Was there any tension in your marriage of Marcos

640
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,288
Fully supportive he was the one who actually

641
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
When I started to

642
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
To get a bit shaky

643
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Through the hole

644
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Drama with Claudia

645
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
And I said to him look I don't know if I can do this

646
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
And he said to me

647
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,976
Do you believe in the business and I said I absolutely believe in the business

648
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,840
He said well then fight for it don't give up fight for it

649
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
Have you ever

650
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Claudia Center

651
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Is The Break-Up absolutely none

652
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,592
Unfortunately the friendship was

653
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Very much a casualty of

654
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Of the business

655
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
But she must know

656
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Where the company has

657
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,832
Has curse her child's name is I know

658
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
People ask me why I didn't change the name and I

659
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
That's why I still refer to myself as

660
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
The car sound

661
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Even though

662
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
I Claudius been gone

663
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Forever

664
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
I co-founded this

665
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Business

666
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
So I did

667
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Didn't feel right to me to just

668
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Soto

669
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Hot her out

670
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Story

671
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,616
So so you buy out Claudius year will I die

672
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Get new tires part of do and you

673
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
And you move on you you continue to grow this business believing that this is going to work

674
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
And at what point were you finally able to leave The Economist

675
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,488
What was the the Milestone you hit in the company that made you comfortable that you could

676
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Focus full-time on this day

677
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,096
Well I had read a lot of

678
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
Literature about women on

679
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Hypno's

680
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
I had to learn the statistic that

681
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Only

682
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
2% of all women irons

683
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Businesses

684
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Ever

685
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
Break a million dollar revenues

686
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Yes isn't that frightening the shocking a

687
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
So that I'd sit myself that goal

688
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
So I just did rot

689
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
Once I get to a million in Revenue I've done

690
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
Something that most

691
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
Women entrepreneurs

692
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Unable to

693
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
To do

694
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
So at that point I allowed myself to

695
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
Quit and focus on I-10 and iPhone

696
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
When you

697
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Finally when you leave the economist

698
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
I'm assuming you told them

699
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
No you didn't

700
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,176
No I didn't I just said I've got another opportunity and

701
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
His my two weeks notice

702
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
And

703
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,320
My then-boss to I wasn't a huge fan of

704
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
I was having a discussion

705
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
And I think Lee remember it was about a week

706
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Before I was

707
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
I handed in my resignation so I knew

708
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Coming

709
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
And I sat in his office and he said to me oh what would you know you do not have an entrepreneurial burn in your

710
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:25,824
And then he's he's even this story gets even better that far

711
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Ended up working at

712
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Crying

713
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,224
And we have won multiple Awards with crying

714
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
As

715
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
The Fosters

716
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
One of the fastest

717
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
50 growing

718
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Spring aerial business

719
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
New York

720
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
I mean to do experiences like that with your boss

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
Do they add fuel to your fire are they

722
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
Powerful motivators for you

723
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
I do know what my biggest motivation

724
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Always was

725
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Guyana

726
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Never about making a lot of money

727
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
Mine was very much

728
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Proving to myself I could

729
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Could do it

730
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,944
Because I had been told by many people over the years

731
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
That I was only capable of

732
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
When in my heart of hearts

733
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
I always

734
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,648
Thought I was capable of why

735
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
But I was

736
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,000
Just never afforded the opportunity to prove it

737
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Okay so so by 2009

738
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
You you leave Economist and then

739
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
I guess you your profitable by the way what what is your Revenue

740
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
We closed

741
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
2009 at

742
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Just drive

743
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
4 million

744
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
So as soon as I focus

745
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
You know a hundred percent

746
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Change the game

747
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
And then we

748
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
We more than doubled every year

749
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Obvious off to that

750
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,184
I guess I guess it was around 2010 where you took on some outside

751
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,280
Investment that's correct I took out my first private Equity Firm in 20

752
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
Why did you do that to me up until this point you are

753
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
The majority

754
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,008
I want her you know you're doing well for a million Revenue would that enable you guys

755
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
To do what

756
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Descale

757
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
So it gave me

758
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Send money to

759
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
To be able to highest

760
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
The mole people buy more inventory cuz we would literally be

761
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,064
You are the code team it was about eight of us nine of us

762
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,160
And we would be sitting there light at night going okay well we need weed

763
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
We do our inventory planning

764
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
We say okay well we need this

765
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
And then we look at it guy what we can only afford

766
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,632
And we just have to cut half of

767
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,168
What we really needed

768
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
We could never keep up with the demands

769
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
So when need private Equity sometime in it just allowed us

770
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
To be able to get

771
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
Even today I can't keep up with

772
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
Bet it

773
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
It enabled us to get closer

774
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
To it at Lake

775
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Respect

776
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
I know that I'm like at a certain point celebrities started to

777
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,792
Like Us Weekly like that it just like us they swallow their babies except the swaddle

778
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
Swaddle blankets

779
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
When did you start to see celebrities using

780
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
The blankets

781
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,728
One week after we went on the market when I say wait on the market

782
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,312
May walking the product to the stores and handing it

783
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
To the store rhinos in LA

784
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,992
Adam Sandler and his wife who just had a baby with photographed on Malibu Beach

785
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,392
With a baby in a carrier with an Aiden and a blanket draped over the front of the baby and it was a fool

786
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,256
Page picture in Oswego police so we had celebrity press

787
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,912
From a week after we went on the market did anybody know what the blanket was

788
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
We actually named 2Pac Paparazzi wants

789
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
So this is a Note 2

790
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,336
How many photographers photograph Al blankets with the

791
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Celebrities trying to

792
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Hide a baby's away

793
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Back in in 2013

794
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
Prince William and Kate Middleton

795
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Call Linda

796
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,344
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

797
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
They had a baby Prince George

798
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,256
The leave the hospital and what did you what did you say

799
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,144
They left the hospital in an Aiden and Anais blanket which blew my mind having been raised in

800
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Australia

801
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,264
Because that I would have bet every penny I had on the fact that we

802
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Was never going to happen

803
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Because there's Royal protocol and no royal baby is have it come out in any

804
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Anything other than

805
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,504
White wool blanket that is being royally appointed

806
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Family you know

807
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
And lo and behold I walk out in

808
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Aiden and I in the world goes

809
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,256
Wild and so did sales go crazy

810
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
Yes you know the typical reaction the Royal effect website

811
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
Crash twice

812
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,704
We sold out of that around the world people will coveting it

813
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
To the point without paying

814
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,056
Three times the value of this

815
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
It was inside outside

816
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Guys we've got other

817
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
Patent over here if the time that they owe just wanted

818
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
What the royal baby

819
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
What was the pattern that

820
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
It was interesting Lee

821
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,952
It was from a PATCO jungle Jam which was

822
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
The third path

823
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
I ever released

824
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
So that particular

825
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Design

826
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Had been on the market

827
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
AES

828
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
When the royal baby

829
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,544
These are not like super crazy expensive 4 pack

830
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
I will now it's 4990

831
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
5 when I started it was

832
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
$44 and that was always

833
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
I never

834
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Set out to build

835
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
A luxurious

836
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
Celebrity you know indoors

837
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Brand

838
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
I wanted to create

839
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
And make all the mothers away

840
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
Of this amazing product it as a

841
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
The mother IG

842
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
Just didn't understand how they

843
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Have baby

844
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
He's without it

845
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
When you arms

846
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
Around I guess around 2000

847
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
Thirteen you guys

848
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
You guys got a big

849
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
That's correct

850
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Swander Pace capital

851
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Into the end

852
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
And they became the majority

853
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Shareholders

854
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,808
Now and I deny however I

855
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
Still Remains

856
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,416
The single largest individual shareholder in the

857
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
So explain how this works they they bought

858
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
A big share of the company

859
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
But that allowed you to

860
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,632
Cash out some of some of the value of the company that's correct I bought they both

861
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
The whole camp

862
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,008
What I did was brought back in as a major shareholder in

863
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
The company I mean so in a sense that

864
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
I guess that made you

865
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Set financially for the rest of your life

866
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Baby blankets have

867
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Just boarded my

868
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Family

869
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
An incredibly

870
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Wonderful Life

871
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
And you're still the CEO

872
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
I am

873
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
Pretty incredible

874
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Result

875
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Yes

876
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
It is

877
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
Although what I will tell you guy is

878
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,632
I much prefer and I believe I'm much fish oil

879
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
At

880
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
The entrepreneurial

881
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Building as a company now that we're over a hundred million dollars

882
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456
It's just very different you know obviously the way you run a hundred million dollar company to the way you

883
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Piranha

884
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,576
You know it 20 or even if 30-40 million dollar company

885
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Yeah you can get by with running your business on it

886
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Excel spreadsheet

887
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
30 million

888
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
It doesn't

889
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Can cut it a hundred

890
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
30 million I was still very much involved

891
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
A lot of

892
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
What's the date today

893
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,008
Where is now at this size oh my gosh there is so much that

894
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
You know I'm only getting updates once a week I'm just

895
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Not involved in

896
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Winnetka news

897
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Why anymore

898
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
So I definitely do not enjoy this

899
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,552
As much as I did when I was much more

900
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,880
In the waves of the

901
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
And I am

902
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
You know I am missed that

903
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Given that you got this

904
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
Big payout do you ever think

905
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
I don't like

906
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Stop

907
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
Working and just take up a

908
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
A hottie or do something

909
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Completely different for a while

910
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Well

911
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
It's

912
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,848
I could never be the lady that lunch

913
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,432
Just not let you remember back to the story of May on the

914
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,016
Couch too much time is nautical

915
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Interesting Lee I was talking to my old

916
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Just order an ID of the night

917
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
What do you think baby is

918
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
You know

919
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
Mom stop being the CEO of Aden & Anais

920
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,376
Yeah I could spend more time and then she's like please. Mom

921
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
How come I'm good with food with the amount of time that we have you around

922
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Zoloft High

923
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
At bedtime

924
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Not only do I see

925
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Think that

926
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,176
It would be good to me that if I maybe wasn't

927
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
The CEOs

928
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,248
Business it might be good for the business

929
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
To bring in somebody who is run a business

930
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
50 size and

931
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
The scaled from

932
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
100

933
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
2

934
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,488
300 because I really believe that that

935
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
Which way this brand is going in

936
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
Do I think I could do it I know I could

937
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Could do it

938
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
That I would do it make

939
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
Hell of a lot more mistakes

940
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
It's in somebody who is

941

Many many years and have a proven track record that

950
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
Let you know that

951
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Would probably do a much better job of it

952
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Then

953
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Then I do end

954
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
And selfishly

955
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Being the mom is full little girls

00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
My voice

957
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Not made

958
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Would be

959
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
In

960
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
15

961
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568

Now look at it it so you know

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
A half a billion dollar Global brand

970
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
So that's my

971
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
That's my ultimate goal for

972
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
The house

973
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
Raegan moya-jones she's the CEO and co-founder of Aden and an a by the way a few months ago

975
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,016
Post ran a story called 52 things I learned in 52 weeks of parenting

976
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
And number one on the list was

977
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
That nobody can

978
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,904
Pronounce Aiden and I

979
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,256

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

994
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,592
Time now for how you built that story comes to us from Shenzhen

995
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,456
My name is Sam Boyd and I'm the founder of guided Imports

996
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,760
Incept

997
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
A lot of times we do interviews

998
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,648
People on the show who invent something and then build a prototype and then they

999
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,208
They find a factory in China to make it

1000
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
And Sam

1001
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
He is the guy

1002
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
In China who finds a factory

1003
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Elvis started about 5 years ago when he

1004
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,448
He was in college and studying Chinese

1005
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
And one day at a restaurant

1006
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Two locals walk up to him

1007
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,944
We started talking and now they did they see a foreigner in this small City and they want they want to know what's what's going on what is he doing here

1008
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
And I asked what they do and you know it sort of led to them talking about their Factory in them asking me do know anyone who's in

1009
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,648
Interested in purchasing our products

1010
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,256
And I said yeah sure I don't really know anyone but I'm going to find someone for you

1011
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
Okay but the product these two guys were talking about pretty specific you were talking about sterilized

1012
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Best Packaging

1013
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
Like the kind of thing you might use for medical equipment

1014
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
And Sam

1015
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,824
Didn't have a clue how to find buyers for

1016
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Something like that

1017
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
But it didn't really matter because

1018
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
After that conversation in the restaurant

1019
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
He saw Ann Arbor

1020
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,368
China is incredible in terms of it being such an entrepreneurial location

1021
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
And

1022
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Fortunate enough to

1023
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,024
Have a western education having grown up in America

1024
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
I said I can be doing this

1025
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
And by this he was thinking

1026
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
I can be the middle that I can be there

1027
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,752
Person between people in the west who want to sell consumer goods

1028
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,568
And Chinese factories that want to make them

1029
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
So learn more about how all this work

1030
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
Temperature of a company in Shenzhen that makes

1031
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Electronic gadgets

1032
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:55,136
And when I saw how things working it I really just explain it as my I open my eyes and soul

1033
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Now this is how business

1034
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,024
So that was the experience that I had where I said why do I have a boss right now

1035
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,864
I don't want to but I want to be the boss cuz I can make something big

1036
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
At the time sandwich

1037
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
I was 22 years old

1038
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
In that day

1039
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
He quit his job at the gadget

1040
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
And set out to become an American Middleman

1041
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
In China

1042
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,736
I was on the other side of the world from friends from Family from every type of safety net that I've ever had in my life

1043
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,808
And the the Monday of me going to work

1044
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
Going to work with leaving my bedroom and going to my

1045
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
Kitchen table in my shared apartments in Shenzhen

1046
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
It was just

1047
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
Oh my goodness what do I do

1048
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
Suzanne started scrolling through

1049
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Reddit pages

1050
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,680
And blogs looking for English-speaking entrepreneurs who wanted their products made in China

1051
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,800
And I started just saying hey I'm an American if you're looking for products let me know

1052
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,104
And I can try to help you find them

1053
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Address for

1054
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Dear Sam signed up about

1055
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,968
15 clients who wanted to make stuff

1056
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
In China like watch boxes and jewelry boxes

1057
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Wallet

1058
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
Toothbrush replacement

1059
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Just Sam

1060
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
I'm and is assistant

1061
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,024
The two of them would call places all over China to find factories

1062
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
To make the product

1063
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
And it's funny cuz I remember at my roommate

1064
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,472
He wasn't too happy with all of the boxes that were just coming in and filling up the apartment

1065
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:19,616
Stacking boxes of just products that we were getting ready to ship out a product

1066
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,176
Now Sam's been in business for

1067
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
3 years

1068
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
He has an office with

1069
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,528
15 employees in Shenzhen

1070
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,856
And the company helps clients find a factory they

1071
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
Quality control to handle all the shipping

1072
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,744
And they do all this for a flat fee about a thousand bucks

1073
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
And last year

1074
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
Sam boyd guided Imports

1075
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Made almost

1076
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Half a million dollars

1077
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Once I started

1078
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,728
Building the this company I said I'm going to stay here for 5 years

1079
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Well

1080
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:51,360
Now I look at it and I already said I'm going to stay here five years I'm overstaying that

1081
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,199
So I don't necessarily know what the future is it could be another five years it could be

1082
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
