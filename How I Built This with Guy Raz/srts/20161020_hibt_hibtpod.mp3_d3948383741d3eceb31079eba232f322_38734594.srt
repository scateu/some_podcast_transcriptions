1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
We went to a contract manufacturing loss

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,472
Latrice Rafael on Assad

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,544
And told him I'll dream cave in the pitch

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,384
And said we need you to do like a test run for us

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,968
He's absolutely no reason

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
To do that

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
Because

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,880
99% of everyone that sits opposite me telling me this story does not

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
Succeed but for some crazy reason

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,536
I think you've got something interesting and I want to be in for the ride

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
Running PR is how I built this

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Show about innovators entrepreneurs

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568

00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
The world

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Dermalogica

18
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
Tell the story about Jane wurwand

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
Really begins

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
About a month before

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
She turned three

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Is that month

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Her father passed

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Gene

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Barely remember

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
What she does remember is

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
All of a sudden

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
Her mom had to get a job

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
There were four girls in the family.

30
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Feed-in

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
She now had to do it all on her own

32
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
This was Scotland in the 1950

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
James Bond happens to have a skillet

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
She was a qualified nurse

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
So even though she had

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
Worked for many many years

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
She was able to fight

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Find a job

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
And also

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Pass along a name

41
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Important lesson

42
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
The five words that changed my life

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
When my mom sang to me

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
It's just in my phone

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Learn how to do

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Learn how to do something

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
She was absolutely adamant that we each of us have to get a skill set training

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,064
That no matter what happen if we were somewhere anywhere in the world

49
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
We would have a skill to an all-hands

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
We could

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Go to work

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
Immediately and earn money and keep food on the table

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
So when she was old enough

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Jane wurwand decided on her skill

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
She become what was called at

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
The time

57
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
A beautician

58
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
And right after she got her qualifications

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
At age 19

60
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Cheap started looking for work

61
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
I decided

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Clown as it sounds so flipping out

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,760
It was freezing cold it was the winter of 1970

64
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
7 is one of the coldest on record

65
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
Animating the Sunday paper and I want to see way so hot

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Display Sonos

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
Because I have to feel better about this

68
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Freezing cold

69
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Platinum living

70
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
So I look at the weather in the Sunday paper that said Johannesburg South Africa

71
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
7 degrees

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
Oh my God I wish I was in Johannesburg South Africa

73
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,664

75
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688

I could be in Johannesburg in a month

84
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120

94
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368

It was

103
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Completely

104
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Different to anything I've ever

105
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Experience

106
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
Yeah I remember my first day going to work I was taking a bath

107
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
But just kept coming I kept putting up my arm and they wouldn't stop and I couldn't figure out what was going on because of the front of the bus it said

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
The point and that's why I was going to work

You got any love it you're going to get work

So how how long did you end up living there

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
I lived in South Africa for 4 years

126
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
And is that where you where you met your husband

127
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
Yeah I met him in South Africa he's from Cape Town

128
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
And he was already in process

129
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
For green card for the United States

130
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
I'm all we would dating his green card came through

131
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
And I can't even explain how exciting it is it is like

132
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Getting the golden ticket

133
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
In a Willy Wonka chocolate bar it's

134
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
It's so hard

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Emigrate

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,807
Legally and do it properly and he did and it went off he went and I was so excited for her

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
And

138
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
At the same time I had a job with an American company

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
And they were based in Los Angeles and

140
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
Within a few months that she got offered a training trip to Los Angeles

141
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
Until I met him when I came on that business trip

142
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Together we just said

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,263
We've gotta do something here this is such an amazing Country Inns

144
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Such an amazing opportunity

145
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
I went back age of my notice

146
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Unhide an immigration attorney in LA and

147
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
4 months later I was on a flight

148
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
To Los Angeles

149
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Secret telling this is like

150
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Early 80s

151
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Yeah it was January 1983

152
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
I was 24 and never been so excited in my life

153
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Londi's in Los Angeles with a suitcase in one hand

154
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,959
And my beauty school diploma rolled up in tucked inside

155
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Honda

156
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,103
Had no idea that it was an unemployment rate of 10.4

157
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
Time in California at that point it was good not to know these things right

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
My boyfriend be looking for a job for 6 months couldn't find anything

159
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,695
Living in a one-bedroom apartment in Marina del Rey ready to take any

160
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
And I'm a Londoner sdorica

161
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
I'm going to get job in Asylum

162
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
So I'm going to start cooling my

163
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Trustee

164
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
And the first thing that struck me was so hardly any adverts

165
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Skin care

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
They were mostly just like

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Paris

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
How weird

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,807
Anyways and I quickly realized the ones I could find it was initially a handful

170
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Roland Beverly Hills

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
I'm a very sordid from

172
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Elitist expensive

173
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Sword of offering

174
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,375
So I went and interviewed at water-cooled go to job interview went to in

175
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
I want to go there

176
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
The people at the front desk clerk

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
And yet

178
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,871
The people I was seeing in the white uniform to wear off in skin care treatments while we're paying like

179
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
So when I have my interview

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
There's Johnny questions message I do a question why I just noticed all the people are American on the front desk and

181
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
The people in the treatment rooms or european

182
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
And the woman who owns a who's French

183
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,047
Said to me was really simple The Americans

184
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Have horrible training they don't know how to

185
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
In treatment

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
And the Europeans Council

187
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
So high in carbohydrates

188
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,847
I want away from the interviews and can't repeating what she just said to me in my head in my throat

189
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
I think we've just spotted the greatest opportunity

190
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
In this industry

191
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Anna is

192
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Train Americans

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
How to do better skin treatments

194
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Ines

195
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
Combining with that

196
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Retailing and selling

197
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
I'm surprised it's like skincare wasn't a big thing in in the us at the time

198
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
Skin care regimen

199
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
Very limited because it was old

200
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Big head big shoulder pads

201
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Dallas it was all makeup

202
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,383
I mean you can pick up magazines than Vogue Harper's Bazaar fashion magazine

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
Always articles on makeup that was nothing

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
The dermatologist

205
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
What will saying oh you can use anything you need soap for multi

206
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Remind you that not only

207
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Did

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
The correct product

209
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
What can you go to result in the skin

210
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Mournful

211
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,887
When you receive a treatment in a salon it's about human Connection in human time

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
And there's something much bigger happening in every salon

213
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Then just the service receiving soap

214
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
I was absolutely convinced

215
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
There was a waiting audience

216
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
For the next

217
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Sierra in skincare

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
So at that point

219
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Like what did you do

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,135
I went back set with Raymond my partner

221
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
And he was hurt

222
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
No we weren't married then we was

223
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
We would just dating living.

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
So he was having the same experience

225
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Because oddly enough

226
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
The only job Piedmont

227
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Secure was

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Selling skin care equipment

229
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
4 Japanese

230
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Company

231
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Commission only

232
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
And we both come from the industry by spinning

233
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
So

234
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
He can sell one piece of

235
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Does Japanese equipment which was amazing uses

236
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Sophisticated equipment

237
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
To do what

238
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
To do skiing

239
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
To do steaming a foliation and it was brand new cutting-edge and he wasn't selling a piece

240
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,815
Honestly I'm trying to sell it

241
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,935
So we were having this Epiphany desota together because he was at how come they don't understand what I'm

242
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Suning

243
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
Absolutely sounded in Europe and the rest of the world and we sat down

244
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
And said

245
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
The opportunity is

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Huge

247
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
We can teach

248
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
How to do correct skin care treatments

249
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,831
And we can sell this equipment to the people that were teaching

250
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
So right then and there you decided to start building a plan to

251
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Create a business

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,607
Yeah we actually cooked at up together on a drive back from San Diego to cos to nakul 2 hours

253
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,703
Nanette driveway completely to through a business plan

254
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Wake up back on the kitchen table

255
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
On5

256
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
Pages of yellow legal pad

257
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
And the plan was

258
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
To train the

259
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Professional

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Skin therapist

261
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Then cold

262
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
An esthetician

263
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
Are we going to take everyone who has lice

264
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
We were going to Bridget to the two-year training that we felt would bring them up to 11

265
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Efficiency where they could be success

266
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
To the goal was really simple we're going to make

267
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Skin therapist

268
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Successful

269
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Unable to run their own business

270
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
And be financially independent

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,759
Social Security was that you guys would open up a school and yeah

272
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,207
Ravens going to still sell equipment he was going to stay on the road I was going to teach

273
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,815
I was going to use the equipment he was selling in the closet I was teaching

274
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
Sell the equipment off to the claws

275
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
Are we cold at the international dermal Institute

276
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
Had you even have

277
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Cash to start at the open up at

278
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Yeah it was a helluva difficult together leaves

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
Cuz remember we were immigrants with no credit right

280
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
We had no Bank references with nothing

281
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,671
So the only space we could find was an empty space that been empty for years

282
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
Next to the Social Security Office in Marina del Rey

283
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
And they found it very difficult to lease

284
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,703
This is like long lines of people waiting for the checks every day exactly

285
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Sitting you know people waiting to receive

286
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
So we rented it

287
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
And then we got the equipment from the Japanese money for

288
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
TripAdvisor

289
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
10 and We're Off to the Races and now the challenge walls

290
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Who are we going to train because we didn't know anybody

291
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Glove Butler

292
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
People have to know what

293
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
We were well so we knew that I'll Target malk it would license

294
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071
Esthetician so in other words they had to order to be licensed

295
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
To work in the industry

296
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703
So I called the State Board of Cosmetology in Sacramento Calif

297
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799

298

309
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
I would you like us to print on Avery labels

310
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191

00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471

We took 70 people rented Chaz took 70 people

327
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,975

The cost was finished at 5

371
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,407
Enduido de Pino pizza and boxed wine by 7:30

372

Lemon water

374
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623

375
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
Eating you no Twix and

376

You know 8310ss Earth

00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Divisions maintenance

381
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
Huge thing or was it just something that you love doing that you were

382
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
It wasn't well Festival I didn't use the word on

383
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
I'm not sure I didn't knew that

384
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Maybe I did

385
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
It was the hot sexy would like it is now

386
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,015
I just saw I'm going to leave the tribe we're going to change this industry

387
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
I'm so for three years the international Donuts she was already busy

388
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,951
Very quickly I realized and Raven and I both together said

389
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
What happened today using when they go back

390
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
And when I would often this they would say

391
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
They will European price

392
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
French German and Italian

393
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Why you don't use an American Prada

394
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007

395
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Which one

396
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
And I realized it would know American made

397
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,479
Products in the salon industry. What time is it in the department store in in the drugstore there's nothing

398
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,599
A light bulb went off the both Raymond and myself we both said

399
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Okay

400
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
The big opportunity

401
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Is product

402
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Unwasted to me

403
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
If you had to write down

404
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
The kind of products you want to use

405
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
Do you believe you could write down the briefs for line unless it

406
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Absolutely

407
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
You should write down the bridge

408
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
Unless said about making a product

409
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,407

Skin care products

464
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
They wanted to be

465
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Different than anything else in the market

466
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
I wanted cleanses

467
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
It would completely went off with water

468
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
I wanted to develop

469
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
An exfoliant that would be really really

470
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Efficient and not cause irritation to the skin

471
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
I have an allergy to lanolin

472
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,023
I didn't want any lanolin in the product I want to know mineral oil no fragrance

473
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
No drawing out

474
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839

Re-named the line Dermalogica

477
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
We had the international dermal

478
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
Attitudes that was kind of fitting with that

479
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
And we wanted to know which line it with a bridge

480
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Between a pharmaceutical product

481
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919

00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975

Pink boxes we had gray and white pack

00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
A packaging look

493
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Pharmaceutic

494
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
Many times people criticized in the early days it was on play

495
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
And we felt it was utilitarian and that was the image we want a

496
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
That was who we were

497
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Even working with you

498
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407

How did you know how to make the

I've no idea

503
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
So

504
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
Icosapent took him is doing you and he said

505
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
Look at you looking for chemist

506
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I can make the product

507
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
You want to use a lot of Botanica

508
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Speak to the rule material for

509
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Supplies for the plumbtech

510
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
And ask them

511
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Who in Los Angeles

512
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Formulating product if anyone

513
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Using a lot of plants

514
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
That's cuz you need to work

515
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Someone that knows he's material

516
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,016
And that was what we did we contacted the raw materials

517
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,624
Supplier New Jersey often do you have any come smell like that using you materials

518
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
And they gave us a list

519
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
And we started cooling relay

520
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Honda Odyssey

521
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
1793 hive

522
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
5 would take a call

523
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,008
And of the five there was one that number one was willing to work with us the number to we felt could do it

524
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Boot camps in LA

525
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah he was in LA he's since passed away but he was in Los Angeles and

526
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
We couldn't pay him that was this

527
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
So we figured out Raymond figured out this amazing kind of

528
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
Way of paying him based on

529
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
The first two years

530
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Manufactured

531
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Products

532
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Percentage of

533
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,888
The product that we manufacture not a percentage of sales because

534
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,008
We wanted to make sure he was tied into the fact that if we wouldn't actually able to ever make

535
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
He wasn't going to get

536
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Paid

537
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
And he agreed

538
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
And and what did you decide

539
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Jamaica was a one product

540
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,808
Two products of 27 products

541
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Because we needed to go in with a.

542
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
If we went in with one or two products

543
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
We couldn't

544
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Capture

545
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Skin therapist

546
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
Attention and say you need to use this

547
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
Exclusively in your room and you need to file this

548
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
It would have been enough to like creams

549
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,520
23 cleanses to moisturizer

550
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Three boosters

551
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Two masks

552
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
Annoying makeup remover

553
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,968
And then we had eight or nine products

554
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
That were professional only peels

555
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Unprofessional moth

556
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
Some things that would only be used in the treatment room

557
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
He was making

558
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
All these price

559
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,584
Yeah he was like Rumpelstiltskin is formulating them all you were going and testing them out a little bit earlier

560
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
I briefed him

561
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,984
He came back 2 days later with a little cardboard boxes samples I could we possibly have made these

562
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,104
Any copyright I mean that's going to save on them both elephant

563
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
But they were both great

564
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
I mean an end

565
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
In 9 months

566
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
We had developed 27 formula

567
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
And we named them in one afternoon

568
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
How are you like even

569
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Funding that

570
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,000
Is easy weather today like

571
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
Hundreds of thousands of dollars

572
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,376
Test it and just to look into the tubes that I probably should

573
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,936
How did he how did you how were you able to do it

574
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
We were buying tubes that nobody wanted we were buying 500 at a time that they were setting to us Vino

575
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Feeling them yourself

576
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:21,248
No but we went to a contract manufacturing Los Angeles they actually saw the Felon also.

577
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,832
And told him I'll dream cave in the pitch

578
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
And said we need you to do like a test run for us

579
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
We can pay you like

580
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
$500

581
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
And his minimum ones with Bowser

582
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,168
Without him we really would never come because he looked to us

583
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
After we've been sort of like pitching

584
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
Breezily for an hour

585
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,336
He's absolutely no reason

586
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
To do that because

587
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
99% of everyone that sits opposite me telling me this

588
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Story does not

589
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Succeed but for some crazy reason

590
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
I think you've got some

591
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
Something interesting and I want to be in for the ride

592
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,560
How are you able to test them

593
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
The product I tested everything approved ever

594
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
On yourself

595
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
You are like your own

596
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Guinea pigs with my own guinea pig and then

597
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
I took it to Claus

598
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
I like week the students like to Austin with a soul

599
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
I love that

600
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
And they were using it in the classroom

601
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Just out of curiosity does that have to go through like

602
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
Any kind of regulatory

603
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
Mission writing

604
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
We would

605
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
What's the movie that we were very young

606
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
New company in

607
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
A lot of the rules I suppose we weren't even aware of

608
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Probably

609
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
But Tom

610
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,168
At the time and still we weren't using any ingredients

611
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Controversy

612
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
We would eliminate

613
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Titulos de Z

614
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Irritating

615
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Ingredients

616
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
I'm so in the nine months that we would

617
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Testing the product

618
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
We would develop

619
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
That we had

620
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Had any incident

621
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
Reactions or allergies

622
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
He said I was at that you just like

623
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
You just launched

624
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Yeah

625
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
We launched in January of 1986

626
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
And the crazy thing was the chemist

627
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,024
To develop these formulas who we were

628
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
Going to pay off over to you.

629
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,632
Came to us in December

630
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,216
Of 585 four months before we were due to Launch

631
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
And said that he did not believe

632
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
In the product he didn't believe we could be success

633
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
For any new venture

634
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
What why did he say that

635
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
Because he just seen so many stars

636
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Cops fail this is the visitor chemist

637
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
This is the guy that you like this is Rumpelstiltskin

638
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
And he just said I don't think it's going to work

639
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
Yeah I don't think it's kind of what I'd like you to pay me out for

640
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
For the formulas

641
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Now

642
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
And we didn't have any money to buy the 4th I mean that he wanted something extraordinary and we whistle them down

643
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Came down to

644
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
United soda $14,000

645
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Hollywood

646
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
Lot of money for yuan

647
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
Why did the chemist not think

648
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
It would work

649
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
How to get to believe enough

650
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
How do you do using the formula

651
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
I think he's at least with two immigrants

652
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,648
These crazy immigrants how well do they know about starting a company

653
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
What do they know about funding a company contest

654
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Doll skin care

655
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
Were you freaking out

656
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
Yes we were freaking out but we had to figure this out scramble

657
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Put it together so

658
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
We

659
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
Borrowed money for family we put together everything we could from the

660
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
School we put it together when you pay them aren't you so nervous like if this is the guy sing to you this is not going to work

661
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,320
And you're like we better come up with a 14000 but we're going to be kind of screwed because this guy saying it's not going to work

662
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,392
We were worried that formulas he was giving us

663
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,000
Literally be younick I exchanged on the table of a Coco's Diner

664
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
Que pasa manila envelope of formulas however we passed the money at

665
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Honda

666
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,520
We were worried that the phone is he giving us for not formulas that we approve but we actually had

667
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
The guy who was going to manufacture the product

668
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Look at

669
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Formulas for us and he's another

670
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
This isn't that right

671
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
This the real deal

672
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
Just thinking about that that moment where a guy was a total expert

673
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Sing to you

674
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
Who's never manufactured

675
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Skin care products that

676
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Listen to work

677
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
And yet you have to come up

678
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
$14,000

679
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
Hey him

680
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Did you have any doubt

681
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
No

682
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
You didn't think you didn't maybe is right

683
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,472
No he couldn't be right wasn't possible because if he was right

684
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
We are about to launch into the biggest disaster of all life that may have been

685
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,712
But we turned each other one with self repeated enthusiasm

686
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Yuan Ray

687
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
Like you were a world like this is going to work it's going to work

688
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,416
Isn't it I need one of us is having a modicum of doubt

689
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,256
Guarantee the other woman having a good day so on the days when I might be saying

690
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
We not crazy right

691
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,888
Rabies

692
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,448
It's going to be great and on the days when he was saying

693
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
I think it's a house of cards maybe it'll going to collapse

694
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
I'd be saying

695
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Nana we just have to

696
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,384
Plato's Closet was so fantastic everybody's excited

697
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
This is going to work

698
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
You know what

699
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
If it doesn't work

700
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,088
It's not the greatest disaster in the world we have nothing to lose by

701
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Alex

702
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
What if it works

703
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
And we did the classic immigrant tsinghua

704
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,840
Look at the population only takes 1% of the population to buy one product

705
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Enormous

706
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Bigger than it could ever be in the UK

707
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
So

708
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Let's go

709
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
Okay so you had no investors and

710
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
And you basically figured

711
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
Will sell the product that will fund

712
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
The manufacturer of more of the product

713
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Yeah exactly

714
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
Most of your customers were who

715
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
My students

716
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,928
The first account we opened was in Bakersfield Calif

717
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
20 hour

718
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,792
And I was one of your students who had a salon there or

719
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Becky Sinclair

720
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
What's the name

721
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
She won't talk with the check and I said Becky I haven't even shown you the product and she said Jane if you and Raymond are in

722
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
I'm into

723
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,592
And I said you are first account in the world

724
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,224
And that was at my student came out they came up and said we want and we want to be positive that

725
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,552
This was a California made skin care product

726
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
We were going to Take On The World

727
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
And you are not selling this in storage right

728
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
The only

729
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
Do you have to have a skin Center hydrotherapy

730
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
And why was that why wouldn't you just like sell it in Walgreens

731
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
I don't know because

732
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
Because I'm asking therapist we knew that this was an educated

733
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
It so it had to be people understand

734
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
The skin

735
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
I don't sell these for the people that brought us

736
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
The party

737
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,152
I my mom another piece of advice she gave me was you leave

738
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
The party with the person you went with

739
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
We whittwood committee

741
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
Headed Dermalogica do

742
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
In that first year

743
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Did $1000000 no face

744
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
That's insane

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
It was

746
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
So

747
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
Insane you must have at that point

748
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
Like I had all these buyers who wanted

749
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
To buy you out

750
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Via

751
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
And those people want you to lend us money

752
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
And you didn't take any of it

753
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
No we wouldn't even sales

754
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Funding the business

755
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Yeah it was so

756
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
What's great I mean

757
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,296
That first year we were planning everything back into the business to know more stuff we hide our itself. We want to

758
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
People walking in that with dumb logic

759
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,416
I thought we were putting everything back into building the business

760
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
But how are you like

761
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Teaching classes and

762
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792

We were working all tell the story a day

765
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
I didn't hire another teacher until 1980

766
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
97

767
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824

What handling the product

We finished it

778
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
10 at 9:11 at night

779
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Everyone came back to my house

780
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Fall flat for spaghetti

781
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
And then we were back at work

782
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
730

783
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
The next morning

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
Lost you

00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Lowry

789
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
No I mean

790
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
We knew we had a

791
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
The tiger by the toe

792
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Tile.

793
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
And we

794
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
New

795
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
That we had to

796
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192
Spread of thousand snatched movie needed eggs in Old basket so that

797
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,520
Is there was a recession in one place it wasn't going to take a business

798
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
And international terminal

799
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
Who is now the number one provider

800
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,272
Advanced education in the industry worldwide we train a hundred thousand skin therapist every single year

801
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
And lost you

802
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,416
A wholesale turnover was a little north of 250 million dollars

803
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Take you guys were

804
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
You basically ran the company

805
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
Promise 30 years

806
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Yeah

807
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
And

808
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
Decided to sell it

809
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Last year sold to Unilever

810
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Why did you decide to do that

811
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:20,384
You know we from the company as what I supposed to say was you never beneficial

812
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Dictatorship

813
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
We've always had a great

814
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Team

815
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
We still have a great

816
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Team but the decisions ultimately

817
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
He came down to Raymond to myself

818
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,904
Product approval Advertiser everything the brand ID

819
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
And you know we realized

820
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
Much that we hate Susan

821
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
Think about it the death rate is holding steady at 100%

822
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Pho

823
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Ultimately

824
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,168
We're going to have to make a plan

825
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
Of what we wanted to do with

826
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
The company we have to dilute has the 17 + 2

827
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
And neither of them wanted

828
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
To come into the business and we didn't want until we tell them

829
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,760
Kind of before they were born we decided we have five children and not coming into Dermalogica

830
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
It's our dream and we believe

831
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
It's a burden

832
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
Two kind of shoulder your children with that

833
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
Responsibility

834
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
And so we

835
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Decided will hire a CEO

836
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,840
Are we going through a couple of CEOs

837
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
In the eight years before we decided

838
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
We eat apples at work

839
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Can we realized

840
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,288
The problem probably wasn't the CEOs a problem was fully off

841
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Because

842
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
We are the founders you don't we have this flu

843
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
Passion about the ownership

844
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,296
It is very hard to run a company when the founders Room Place

845
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Kind of want to have the last word

846
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
And so we decided we should at least it's

847
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
Explore the idea of an ox

848
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,048
We've never taken a phone call from anyone that was interested in buying never even taking a

849
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
Cool cuz we said we don't even have a car

850
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
It's a despot

851
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
Until we we could have lined up

852
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,008
Who we thought would be the right partner

853
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
For us

854
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
And then we we set about

855
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Deciding which ones we wanted to court

856
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
And Unilever

857
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
With very aligned with us

858
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
On that sustainable living plan

859
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
The very long with us on the volume

860
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
And so we decided to go forward

861
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,024
And I have to say we have one year in and it's been a fence

862
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
So much so that Raymond and I kept

863
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Absentia.

864
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
The company was still involved

865
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,752
It and that chemists the one who like bailed a month before Dermalogica

866
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
Lochte he ever come back to you guys

867
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
And apologize

868
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
No NFL

869
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,968
He never did know he was like Rumpelstiltskin that flew out the window and never came back

870
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
It means amazing like looking back at your story

871
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
Because your mom was a widow with

872
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
For girls

873
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,280
And the cheetah racing around and she must been a little worried when you laugh

874
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
England for South Africa and

875
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Us

876
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Very little

877
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
What did she make of your

878
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Of your success

879
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,848
I know I know that she was really proud she felt validated in the direction that she pushed us in

880
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
She passed away in 2001

881
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
But she's so awesome

882
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Success

883
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,064
The Lofts of months of my mom's life shed Alzheimer's

884
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
I'm not sure if she remembered

885
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
Anything about gemologica

886
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,768
She remembered me and I sat on her bed when she was in the hospital in

887
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
I was giving her money

888
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Carol I was right back to filing her nails and

889
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Painting lemon

890
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
She was watching me

891
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
And she

892
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,520
I looked across at the woman who was in the chair next to her

893
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,128
And she said to her with a huge liquor price she said to

894
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,944
My daughter is a qualified manicurist you know

895
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,552
And am I smile just always doing it because I felt the

896
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,600
If she doesn't remember anything about

897
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
What's accessory side she's really proud

898
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
But I got that training and I'm going to be out

899
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Okay

00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
And I was

901
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,192
Jane wurwand founder of Dermalogica

Now spends most of her time on helping women around the world become entrepreneurs through her foundation

903
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,968
And of course we couldn't let Jane go without asking for her number one skincare tip

Soap Puritas

905

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Hundreds of stories that

922
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
You guys have been sending us these are stories about

923
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
The things that

924
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
You are building

925
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,808
Like many new Ventures this one though

926
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
To talk about

927
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Start with the problem

928
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
We could actually refer to it as trash juice

929
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Fresh juice

930
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Juice

931
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Juice

932
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,608
Which is the runoff from dumpsters and garbage truck

933
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:33,472
If you're in urban dweller you walk by and you smell it and you do not want to go anywhere near that

934
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
Okay so Michael vanity and its Partners came up with a device to put a stop

935
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
To trust you

936
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Before it even starts

937
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
Think of it as a utility cart

938
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,248
There is a hundred foot hose on it

939
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
And when you pull the trigger at the end of the toes

940
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Phone comes out

941
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Think of it

942
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Scrubbing Bubbles x 1000

943
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,744
In these Scrubbing Bubbles are, like the secret magical ingredient here

944
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,072
Michael says they're full of bacteria that eat up all the

945
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,376
Junk in dumpsters and in trash chutes

946
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,216
And then the phone kind of evaporate so you don't even need water

947
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
To clean it up and

948
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
No water

949
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Old tractors

950
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
We test out the product

951
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
We got incredible feedback

952
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
And

953
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
The maintenance guys

954
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
Cut my cleaning time in half

955
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:24,416

956
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720

957
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,816
What orders are coming in and Michael says so far they're doing pretty well

958
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,656
