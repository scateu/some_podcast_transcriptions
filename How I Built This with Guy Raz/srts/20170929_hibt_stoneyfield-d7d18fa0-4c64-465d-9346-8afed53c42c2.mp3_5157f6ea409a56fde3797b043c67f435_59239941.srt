Perfect pear

11
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
On many occasions I would tip toe over

12
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
To the office to call my mother-in-law

13
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Have a chat to see if I could borrow another 3520 500 to make ends meet and one night I heard the

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Click click of call waiting on my mother-in-law's phone and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't do this weight you

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
Telling her mom not to lend you money

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
Well she had no reason to believe and it was insane

17
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
Ron NPR it's how I built this a show about

18
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements they built

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
How to hippy farmers in a County

20
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
Lily Bell

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
Start a barn

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
And threw it into Stonyfield

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
What are the biggest yogurt brands

24
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
In America

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
I think it's

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,624
Fairly safe to say that Stonyfield yogurt has had more ups and downs

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Really more down

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,976
Then just about any other

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
And it's a pretty unlikely tale to begin with

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
2ego hippie farmer

31
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
With no real desire to build a copper

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Wind up

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Building a company

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Daystar small

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,824
Milking their own cows making their own yogurt selling locally

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
And then eventually

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Spreading themselves

38
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Way Too Thin

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Sliding into

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Deep.

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,600
A whole slew of near-death experiences

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Never

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
White dyed infected group

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
He grew into one of the most

45
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Popular yogurt brands

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
In the United States

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
And one thing about Stonyfield co-founder

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Gary hirshberg

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
Is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company

50
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
He knew what it took to run one

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
Because when I was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
His dad owned and ran up

53
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Pretty big cucumber

54
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
You know it was in those days they were probably

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
50 shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
And probably

57
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
150 in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,976
So how many people did your dad's company employ

59
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
Several thousand I think at their Peak they were at

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
The 2800

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Wow

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
These are true company town

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
Course in those days manufacturing was into the state was built in the region of the country were weird

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Built on things that we made

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
The dark side of that is that when they

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Especially because of

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,248
Cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapse

68
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
No all these communities did as well

69
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
And what happened to your family

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,256
Well it was really a 303 for the family's business

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
Went bankrupt

72
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
My parents got divorced

73
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
And my childhood role model

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
A died suddenly of spinal meningitis how it was

75
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
It was a wake up here

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
I mean did your lifestyle change

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
Overnight cuz you were probably pretty

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Prosperous

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Family iPhone family

80
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
Yeah there we were certainly comfortable I was a ski racer

81
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
You know I wasn't

82
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,976
Every worrying certainty about the next meal are banned in in a week

83
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
Travel up north on weekends for

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Skiing we had a

85
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Home on a lake

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
But yeah it it you know the world I mean I think everybody at 14

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Deneb conscious being

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Starts to

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Edit your life

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
Undergoes changes better my case they were kind of expedited

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
I am

92
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
My father I got it

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
I began drinking

94
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
And so I had to ask her to confront all of that

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
And yeah

96
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
You know watch to sort of all the rock

97
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Just suddenly turned to mush

98
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
You know my mom

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,095
Became a single mom with 5 kids I was the oldest and how does she support you what is she

100
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Well yes so Chris

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Again because

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
My dad's

103
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Business

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
It was gone now so you know there was a

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
Huge amount of tension there was lots of battling over alimony which

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
For money that didn't exist so

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,807
She wound up becoming a buyer for a local family-owned Hotel chain actually close friends of ours

108
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Which eventually sold to Sheraton and

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
In-N-Out

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Gradually she parried that into becoming

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Ultimately the senior buyer for Sheraton worldwide

112
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
And then from there she became the senior buyer for Disney for the Epcot Center

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
When they built that so yes she she was like literally

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,847
You know Mom with 5 kids running a little general store part-time is kind of a hobby

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
To be coming up

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Dino Global Executive

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
So disliked

118
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
Major change in your life happens at the age of 14 which

119
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Of course

120
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
It's going to have an impact and influence

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Did you

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,743
Did you start to think about a business about being a businessman that early

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
I mean besides parents were both entrepreneurial

124
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,423
No I I started to think about running as far as I possibly could away from it

125
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
Obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a

126
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
Result of a steady decline in my

127
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,711
My grandfather my father and my uncle were all in the business and I used to sit

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Or work

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,367
It there and I would listen to them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Passionately

131
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
About what to do about this downturn

132
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
And so to me business was this thing where people got

133
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
People yelled at each other

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
Are people hung up phones on each other

135
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
People were stressed

136
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Employees lost their jobs

137
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
And if and on top of that

138
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
Serious pollution soap

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
It led to my deciding that business was the worst thing on the planet the last thing I wanted to do in life

140
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,063
I've made a really pursue a career in The Sciences environmental Sciences

141
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
So would you do after high school

142
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
I went off

143
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Yelp to a college that was

144
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Dist

145
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
And overtly

146
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
Liberal arts non-business environment is Hampshire College

147
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Whitaker skin burns and

148
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
If you want to get business knocked out of you

149
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Yeah

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Yeah but stick with it because it

151
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
It turns out that it was probably the best training for an entrepreneur

152
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
That there is

153
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Because this is a school

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
That has no credits no requirements no grades

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
You only pass

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
Matriculate through by Contracting

157
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,975
And making progress with an individual professors who take you on as their

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Essentially Apprentice

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
And in many cases

160
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Is the funding of

161
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Where can I wind up

162
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Diving deep into ecology and environmental science

163
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
And turns out

164
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
I was

165
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
Those hating business still and thinking

166
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
You know again now I thought

167
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,711
Getting educated I realized my God we're warming the planet

168
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Detoxifying word

169
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Depleting

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,879
Waterwood disturbing you know biodiversity everywhere it's all because of Industry so I was

171
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Assertive radicalizing in my environmental beliefs but

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
But actually getting business

173
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Bells all the way

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Should I get

175
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
College that

176
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
That you went and worked

177
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Yeah

178
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,519
At the time there was a little ecological Research Institute on Cape Cod called the new Alchemy Institute

179
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,407
And they were advancing the idea of using wind and solar power building really sustainable food

180
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
Long before those words were in our vernacular

181
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
I went from

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Windmill

183
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
Apprentice to Windmill technician to executive director and

184
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
And I saw them on The Cutting Edge

185
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
Of how we were going to need to grow food in the future

186
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
In-N-Out

187
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Around this time you also me

188
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Sam human rights

189
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Right

190
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
And he is the guy who's going to

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Become your business partner

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
He's also running his own organic farm

193
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,199
Right so he was mostly teaching organic farming methods raised beds

194
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Biological Pest Control

195
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
A greenhouse season extending

196
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,415
Basically kind of back-to-the-land type stuff but without with an organic Focus

197
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Busy running this is a non-profit and just

198
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
Oh yes it was a nonprofit so we're both we're each running nonprofit

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,423
But I got really excited by his work and of course he was back here in my native New Hampshire

200
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Which I love and he's older than you

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Oh yes he's about six

202
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
16 years old or Samuel

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
At that time

204
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Had six kids

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
I was a single guy

206
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
But

207
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
You know we became fast

208
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Friends

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
And a he asked me if I would join the board of the world education

210
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Saturday help him

211
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
With his money raised

212
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
IMDb have a hard time raising money

213
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
In the first place

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
Well right about that time Ronald Reagan came into

215
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Office and

216
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
Essentially cut off the lifeline

217
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
4

218
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Sustainable energy research

219
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Sustainable a

220
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
So essentially money dried up

221
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
For these nonprofits and so we would sit at Samuels board meetings

222
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
At the Royal Education Center

223
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,783
And by the way it critical to this whole story he had one cow

224
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Animal Ebel

225
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
And Samuel was experimenting with yogurt

226
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
And he was

227
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
A fermentation

228
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Nutcase

229
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
I mean he make sauerkraut beer wine

230
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
A kimchi

231
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
If it fermented

232
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
He made

233
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
When I say he made it he made in

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Credible

235
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Foods animed

236
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
This wonderful yogurt from his cow has one cow

237
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
And we would sit at these board meetings

238
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Eating bowls of this absolutely incredible

239
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
Playing cream on top whole milk yogurt

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
And I'm just about

241
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
Up one step Samuel is originally from Brooklyn

242
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
I grew up very poor

243
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,047
In Flatbush but he got to know a lot of these old

244
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Jewish yogurt makers down there

245
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
And they taught him yogurt maker

246
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
And I went they explain to him as it's very simple it's all about the weather

247
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
At meaning times and temperatures

248
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,895
It's about the weather the humidity the temperatures and he

249
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,527
Enter Samuel for his family and for the school experimented with yogurt for many years

250
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,903
And one day and and unfortunately none of us can remember who but one of us said

251
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Why don't we start selling this stuff too

252
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
It'll make up for the

253
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Lack of

254
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Grant money cuz it was

255
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,887
Nigh impossible to raise money during that period

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
And

257
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
You know

258
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Seemed like a pretty good idea so

259
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Samuel

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Was able to get

261
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Some Catholic nuns

262
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,687
To provide a $25,000 Grant wait nuns

263
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Yeah

264
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
The Sisters of Mercy

265
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Which is

266
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
You'll hear the moment the appropriate name

267
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Are they were taking Mercy on these two crazy entrepreneurs

268
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
They were selling them honest

269
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
And they were

270
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Wanted to turn their principal into a

271
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Local community Act

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
Canned salmon to use that money to build the first

273
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Yogurt work

274
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
And

275
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
About the time that the money came in which

276
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Who is April of 83

277
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
When we opened

278
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
I decided that

279
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
I was

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
Pretty interested in joining him full-time not

281
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
So much to run the yogurt but

282
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
I thought that I could

283
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Help him

284
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
Run his farming School while he did this little fun

285
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Yogurt venture

286
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159

00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,031
Cabin with no Plumbing

292
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
And I put solar cells on it and

293
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
And the Cameron family live there

294
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
And our interns are

295
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991

Crazy

297
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Powdered milk in yogurt making

298
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Operation

Jars and

304
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559

To cuss

306
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Depression glass

307
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
Well we started with one cow

308
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Send me use the money to buy six more cops

309
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
So now he's milking 7

310
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871

Finances

312
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
This little tiny Factory in

313
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
Tiny little room that you could only really described as

314
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Is a closet in a

315
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
1792 Barn

With a wood wood fired boiler

317
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
And

318
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
The way it worked was he put in a

319
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
50 gallon stainless steel tank

320
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
We bought class

321
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Hiccups

322
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
And

323
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Sammy was a very

324
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,775
Charming and persuasive guy in after paying for his first shipment of Cups he managed to somehow get continue to get shipments

325
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
5 months without

326
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
Paying for any more so

327
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
He started producing April 9th 1983

328
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
And took

329
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
His first

330
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
Six packs of yogurt

331
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Drove down to

332
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
The local

333
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Supermarket

334
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
The hardwoods and said would you guys sell the stuff

335
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Well they didn't know what the heck this was

336
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
And

337
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,095
They said what price should we sell it at 7 so I don't know whatever

338
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Whatever price you think

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
We were not business people

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
So we started selling

341
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,847
At a dollar 49 a quart which is the same price down and was selling

342
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Hey by the way was only making

343
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
10 quarts

344
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Six packs of plain cream on top yogurt

345
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
It was like Ambrosia guy it was the most incredibly perfect

346
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
Products still the best thing we make

347
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
So you guys just start to

348
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
You know basically

349
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Sell it locally

350
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
And and

351
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Eventually

352
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
The Harwich people called suggestion of this is good

353
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Selling

354
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
By the way below the price we could afford

355
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
So Sam is a great

356
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
So we eventually hired a young

357
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Local

358
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Guy to drive a van

359
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
We couldn't afford a refrigerator van so we just told me

360
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
To drive fast

361
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
But yeah so by the time I got there

362
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
5 months into this thing

363
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Samuel head

364
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Probably about

365
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
$50,000 of sales

366
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
And

367
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
My gosh

368
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
The product was selling through but he couldn't keep up

369
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
And he was out of cash

370
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
And

371
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Course he wasn't paying bills

372
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
He was out of cash because

373
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Is the lag time between

374
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
When he's getting paid

375
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,015
Well he had to pay for grain to feed the cows he had to pay this guy to drive

376
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,855
And bring the yogurt as I told you before he wasn't paying for his cups

377
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
But he had to pay people to help

378
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
And I got the $35,000 it started just

379
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Disappeared overnight

380
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Honestly I don't know how I got through five month

381
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Because

382
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
When I arrived on September 15th of 83

383
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
Did Samuel have these old army surplus desk

384
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Indus farmhouse

385
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
That the three desks work

386
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
Piled high with envelopes on open mail

387
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,783
Okay I'm now the executive director of the relegation Center

388
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
And the vice president of Stonyfield Farm

389
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:27,231
And I'm going to spend my first at which of the name of the farm Stonyfield

390
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Are still there

391
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
So I spent the morning separating I thought

392
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
The checks

393
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
From the

394
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Bill's the only problem was

395
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
There were no checks

396
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,311
I Samuel any money that I come in he had used it to buy feed

397
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
You know lubrication equipment

398
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Fuelwood whatever

399
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
And

400
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,527
By 11 a.m. that morning my first day

401
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,111
I calculator that we were $75,000 in the red

402
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
So what did you do

403
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Well I did what any self

404
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
Respecting entrepreneur does I called my mother

405
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
And I borrowed $30,000

406
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
From Harwich

407
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
She could ill-afford as I told you before she

408
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
She was

409
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239
You know her own business women with for you no family but

410
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
You know what I had

411
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:17,663
A good fundraising scale so I went too many of my former funders and many of his and I said look can we

412
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Can we borrow

413
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
These were the the founders of the farm that you had run back in Massachusetts

414
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Right well Samuel had a handful of

415
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,023
Folks who had been his funders like I said he he raised $125,000 so they work

416
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
They're probably 20 or 30

417
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Wealthy individuals and then I had

418
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Raise a million dollars a year so I had

419
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
You know by net worth

420
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Individuals out there and I

421
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Look what I told him was very simple I said

422
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
You know the first

423
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
10 years of artwork

424
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,223
Was all about proving that you can grow food organically

425
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,599
But if we're going to be successful with this revolution I said to the funders who had gotten us there

426
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,671
Then we're going to have to prove that you can actually make money doing

427
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
And we're going to have to build a model Enterprise

428
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
That will show that you can

429
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
Avoid the use of pesticides avoid the use of hormones with cows

430
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Support family farmers

431
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
Not depend on fossil fuels

432
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
Etc etc all the things that we were doing in the nonprofit context

433
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
I said you know this is

434
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
I'd like to ask you to join us in the next phase which is

435
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Helping us to

436
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,879
I build a successful business and instead of asking for a grant I'm asking you for a loan

437
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,719
And I wound up borrowing $125,000

438
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:42,655
Okay so you go out and you start raising money and did you and and and Samuel sit down and say

439
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,031
Okay how we going to structure this business like we are co-owners is a

440
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
Joint venture like how did you did you ever do that

441
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Well we did because

442
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
One of the things I did was I hired a lawyer

443
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
Cuz I knew we didn't know what we're doing and the first thing this lawyer

444
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
Said to me was he said Gary

445
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
What percentage of the world Education Centers revenue is coming from

446
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
The yogurt well that point

447
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
It was getting close to

448
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
75%

449
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
And he said well guess what you got to spin it off

450
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Because under IRS rules

451
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
That makes

452
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Makes you a business

453
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Not a non-profit

454
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,687
So Samuel and I realized we're going to have to buy this from the world education set

455
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
So we agreed

456
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
To a split

457
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
In the company

458
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Translate

459
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
And then I

460
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
Went out to our lenders

461
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
725 k

462
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
And I said look up will you take stock in this company

463
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
We did our first private

464
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Replacement

465
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
You know threw a dart at the wall figured out the value of the business

466
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
What's the time

467
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Well

468
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
We thought we're going to value

469
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Add $1000000

470
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
By then

471
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
In 1984 our sales were up to

472
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,295
Around 250 thousand a year in this is Justin in New Hampshire or all of them

473
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Well

474
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
By 84 we were

475
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Starting to

476
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Push the boundaries

477
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
We're selling the about 20 stores

478
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
And

479
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
Eventually we started selling to a

480
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
An Independent Grocer who had seven stores

481
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
I called Alexander supermarkets now part of Hannaford

482
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
In the Northeast

483
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Anda

484
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
This will give you the real flavor for this

485
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,199
What was going on here someone Sunday night we're having dinner at the Caymans after milking

486
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Hand of the phone ranks and Jack demoulas

487
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
The nephew of the

488
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,439
Owner of the demoulas Market Basket chain calls and says Samuel

489
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
Why are you selling to buy competitor to this little seven store chain of Alexander's and not to me that he had 34

490
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
How to be honest mist

491
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,519
We don't have enough cause he said we'll get some more goddamn cars and he slammed the phone down

492
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
And we took that is very

493
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,895
Good business advice so we went out and

494
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
Do I heard even further and

495
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
So we

496
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Now realize we needed to

497
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
You know

498
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,671
Get serious about this and so we did manage to lease a small refrigerator truck and started

499
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
Delivering actually to the Market Basket Warehouse

500
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
How much yogurt were you making at that

501
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
We're producing now about

502
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
360 cases a week of yogurt

503
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
And a case of like

504
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
24 cups

505
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Six pack

506
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Six packs of Courts

507
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,895
So by the end of 84 we were our run-rate was headed

508
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
In the start of half a million-dollar range but you were probably spending more money than you were bringing it right

509
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
You have no idea we were burning

510
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
I mean I kept

511
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Not

512
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,999
Weekly cash flows not daily casuals I kept hourly cash

513
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,119
I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon

514
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
In order for us to buy then the cup guy it figured out

515
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Sammy wasn't paying I'm so

516
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
Now we are on very short terms with everybody

517
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
I mean

518
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
My fundraising skill turn out to be

519
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
Will it be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills in his

520
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Families unbelievable

521
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,903
Attention to detail they were perfectionist all but we were also we would also be nowhere

522
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Without my ability to keep getting credit

523
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
And cash because it was burning

524
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,840
Believer on fumes

525
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
When we come back in just a moment tell Gary and Samuel begged and borrowed

526
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
How to keep Stonyfield going

527
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,104
And how they almost lost it anyway again

528
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,944

559
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Almost

560
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Broke the

561
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Basically running on fumes

562
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Electronic bring in more money by

563
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Just

564
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Finding

565
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Kmart stores

566
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
To sell their yogurt

567
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
In those days

568
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
A Whole Foods didn't exist yet

569
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,840
But the holy grail for natural products was a little priest or chain called bread and circus Arts events

570
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Who became part of

571
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
And they had one store in Cambridge

572
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
On Prospect

573
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
And you know we were selling now to

574
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Demoulas Market Basket

575
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
This is now I'm talking to live 84

576
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
And

577
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
And we were desperately trying to get down there cuz we knew that

578
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
If we could crack

579
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,088
Bread & circus every other little Natural Foods Co-op in New England

580
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Would then take us in

581
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
And we kept going down there

582
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
And they

583
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:03,072
Said no no no we've already got you know hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to

584
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
In their teepee with their wetgo you know they didn't need

585
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Another

586
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
You know organic yogurt from some

587
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Crazy people in New Hampshire

588
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
To play would you guys do

589
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
So in July of 84 I had my 30th birthday at the

590
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,176
The farm in my I had my old Ultimate Frisbee team

591
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Come up

592
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
To visit me most of them lived in Cambridge

593
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
You might imagine

594
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
And

595
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
I said look

596
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,928
It's wonderful you've all come if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under Bread & circus

597
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
I'm prospects

598
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Cambridge and asked for my yoga

599
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
That was on a Sunday on Wednesday

600
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,960
Mary Carol Skinner the buyer Bread & circus called and said Gary I don't know what's going on but the man is suddenly gone through the roof

601
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,592
We're getting all kinds of requests for yogurt when can you get it in there will I got in my car and I

602
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Made the first delivery. After

603
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
About

604
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
A month later we were her number one selling yogurt

605
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
She took us in the other to bread and circuses

606
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
And off we went but

607
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
It was my frisbee

608
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
I mean

609
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,000
You know that's what it takes. You know I always say we can ship the yogurt 3000 miles

610
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,864
18in that makes all the difference you get in people's mouths and then they're going to ask

611
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
But it was the best-selling yogurt

612
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Bread and circuses

613
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Loved it but you were not making a profit

614
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
No that's absolutely right

615
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Stressful

616
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Utterly

617
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
It was impossible.

618
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
This was crazy right we're growing

619
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
We're booming and wood burning cast soap

620
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Yeah we're 24

621
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,952
7 Samuel had six kids

622
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Secret weapon

623
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
Cuz it was sort of indentured servitude I mean

624
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
You know it was hard

625
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
If they were going to have dinner that night it was hard for them to say no to

626
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
No milking or making it by the way

627
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Hit several of his kids were Arts

628
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Just absolutely

629
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Astonishing

630
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
We good yogurt makers they had their father

631
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
And mother sense of

632
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Pride in the product

633
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
This is around the time we meet Meg

634
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Become your wife

635
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Yasso

636
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
A month after that fateful meeting with Bread & circus

637
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
We had our Summer nofa Conference

638
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
Northeast organic farming

639
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
Is it turn that I was the Keynote

640
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
What speaker

641
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
And so I started talking about this

642
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Enterprises

643
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
That was now

644
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
A year old and

645
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
You know all of the dreams of

646
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Organic farmers lie we were sort of like

647
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
I didn't talk about our financial problems

648
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Show the

649
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
That this is possible that if you

650
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Build it they will come

651
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,760
And a right after I finish my speech this

652
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
It's very

653
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Adorable

654
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Organic farmer from

655
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
New Jersey

656
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Who is running her own non-profit

657
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Farm down there

658
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,512
I waited patiently to ask me a question will that

659
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Turned out to be what

660
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
Now my 31-year wife Meg

661
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
And

662
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,448
We began courting and

663
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,544
A Thanksgiving that year and 84 Meg introduced me to her family

664
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
And her mom had been

665
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
The Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture

666
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Weather for New York State

667
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,248
So she had a kind of an egg orientation

668
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,344
At one point she kind of whispered to me that she'd be

669
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Okay with

670
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
If I needed some money

671
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Would lending me

672
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Well course I needed

673
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Sochi

674
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Londa

675
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
$50,000

676
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
And

677
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,424
Now we're heading into 1985

678
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
We've no lunch small cups of

679
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Unflavored yogurt

680
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
I

681
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Now needed to raise about

682
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
500000

683
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
Cuz we needed to buy more cups more fruit you know

684
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
People expected us to pay

685
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
So

686
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
Doris had loaned us 250

687
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,856
Towards the $500,000 as your mother-in-law my mother-in-law excuse me

688
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
And

689
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,952
I started raising then I got to about

690
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
275 300

691
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
I just heard of a month or so later

692
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
Well I think we can increase

693
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,984
Insouciant Chris to a hundred and eventually I got across the Finish Line got the 500

694
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
Why did you need so much money

695
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Well if the factory itself

696
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
Was probably 300,000 the factory

697
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
On Stonyfield Farm

698
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
Yeah the little we call that the yogurt work

699
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
A little Shoppe

700
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
You know what's up

701
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
Drafty Old Barn it was

702
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
We needed to switch over from wood

703
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
2 oil

704
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
We needed to just get more modern we needed to get the warehouse

705
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
The barn

706
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,608
You made sanitary we had to get real floor drains we had to

707
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Stop being a

708
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
Kind of a kitchen operation

709
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
And what a cows how many cows do you have

710
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,824
Well that point we were up to 19 button

711
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
One Night in this same era

712
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
Sammy without milk and heated milk

713
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,760
The first of the 19 cows and the power went out

714
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
Samuel came in and said

715
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
You know I need help

716
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:46,720
Cuz he has his electric milker so Louise and I went out and started milking well

717
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
Yeah it was freezing the cows hated it if you haven't hand melt

718
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
Let me tell you that they didn't it was

719
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
It was a nightmare to Kaiser

720
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Kicking over the bucket we had these

721
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
Kerosene lanterns in this firetrap Barn

722
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
You know everyone's well the car with Kik one over in the milk with

723
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
Put spell on the lanterns

724
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
We finished milking the last

725
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
Kyle at about 3 a.m. in time to start milking the first

726
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
And that was the night when we realized you know what

727
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
We got to sell the cows

728
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
You had

729
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
To sell the cows because

730
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
You guys could not milk them

731
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
All by yourself

732
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Right

733
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
And until the next morning

734
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
We reached out to a

735
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
Local Jersey farmer cuz we're using all

736
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
Jersey cow milk

737
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,336
And said look what you buy are cows and start selling us milk well he said I'm not going to have anything to do with that

738
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
That Organics

739
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,224
And he was fine with hormone-free antibiotic-free but he didn't want to

740
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,320
Fetus cows herbs and buy organic feed and put that was your condition

741
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Well

742
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Honestly we had no condition

743
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,952
We were Beggars not too sore so we briefly

744
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,560
At this moment in Stonyfield life we briefly departed from organic

745
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
You had no choice

746
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
We had no choice

747
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
Did you get that disturb you did you

748
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,264
Betraying your values at that Mommy I guess because you were

749
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
You are hemorrhaging you send me money

750
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
But you had this demanded

751
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
You had to make and you didn't have enough cows

752
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Yeah and

753
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,224
I not only had all these problems but I had my mother

754
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
And worse

755
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
My mother-in-law's money

756
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
And so you know what that makes

757
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
A guy pretty practical

758
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
You know venture capitalist

759
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
The reason they want

760
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
When they call f&f money first friends and family money

761
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
It's cuz they know that you might as well.

762
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
Supernatural things get rough you might

763
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Get up and walk away if it

764
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,824
Some Harvard MBA with with a tie

765
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,872
But if it's your mother's money

766
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,432
Yeah and so now we worked for our moms

767
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
Which must have been pretty stressed

768
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
Oh yeah you know what happened

769
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
In this farmhouse

770
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
I always had payroll on Thursday morning

771
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
At and by this point was a half a million dollar business

772
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
And I never had cash in the bank

773
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
That night before payroll

774
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Never just this is became our way of life

775
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,680
And so I thinking Meg was asleep

776
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Ann Arbor

777
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
Bedroom which is about 50 feet from my office I would

778
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
On many occasions

779
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,640
Tiptoe over to the office to call my mother-in-law

780
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,760
Have a chat to see if I could borrow another 3500 2500 to make ends meet

781
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
And eventually Meg got on to this one night I heard the Click Click of call waiting on my mother-in-law's phone imegwu

782
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,256
Who's calling from the house to say mom don't do this with your wife

783
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
Was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business because

784
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,216
She's living in a nightmare when she saw

785
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,544
How crazy was it me we had chimney fires we had

786
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
The well pump would go out

787
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:49,248
The power would I be wearing this Hilltop Farm a long way from anywhere

788
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,392
Well she had no reason to believe and it was insane

789
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,024
But why did you believe it and did you think it was three years into this thing

790
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,840
You are

791
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Dick that big time

792
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Yeah

793
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Well

794
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Say this

795
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Meg

796
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
You know fortunately loved me

797
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Even more fortunate probably loved the yogurt

798
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
And we have nowhere else to go

799
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:25,856
Is she giving up her job done on her Farm in New Jersey and signed on

800
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,208
Do this crazy damn Enterprise but here's where the story if

801
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
I know that you think it couldn't get worse but

802
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
Has Tessa

803
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Lily Tomlin says it

804
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
It is

805
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,936
It got a lot worse before it got worse

806
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,496
Well so now I'm going to jump

807
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
A year-and-a-half

808
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
We've now expanded the plant we're buying milk

809
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
10 or 12 Farms

810
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,784
I'm going to guess let me just tell you the number we are at about a one-point

811
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
$3000000 a year run rate

812
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
And we have Max

813
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Out this

814
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Little farm there is no

815
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,256
You cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this

816
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
So presumably you are looking to

817
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Another Factor

818
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Right

819
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
Spring of 86

820
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
We are

821
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,800
Out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in Western Mass

822
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
This is Greenfield Mass

823
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
We were desperate we did not do any

824
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,712
Have the financial due diligence one would normally do we just

825
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Got our way and then we started making yogurt

826
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
And it was

827
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
Rate that mean all of a sudden

828
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Pave roads

829
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
You know

830
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
Regular power

831
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
A dairy and we thought we were

832
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Coming out of the woods yeah

833
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
The yogurts being made somewhere else

834
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Never see it yeah yeah

835
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,288
But now we're on the bend into the fall of 87 October of 87

836
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,152
A fateful weekend the weekend of the crash of 87 and Wall Street

837
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,712
But what happened for us was on the Thursday night

838
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Of that weekend

839
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
Becky capeless the banker for his

840
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Manufacturers Bank

841
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Call Mia

842
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,720
At the farm and said Gary would you like to buy this Dairy

843
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
The theory that that was producing your

844
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,096
The Prisoner yogurt and I said no we

845
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
We don't have the cash to buy their dad.

846
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
And I said why are you asking she said well

847
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
They're in their third year of their

848
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,872
Small business administration loan guarantee and the SBA has enough to not going to renew it

849
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,688
And therefore are back my boss is going to have to

850
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
To pull our loan to him

851
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
And that means that he's probably not going to make it

852
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:36,416
The next morning at 7 a.m. that their bank went in and put them into chapter 7

853
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Padlocked

854
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
The place locked it up

855
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,536
My cups my Lids my fruit my yogurt

856
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Was in there

857
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,632
But suddenly this thing is in receivership

858
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,704
Wait a minute your production comes to a halt

859
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
Outsource

860
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
Blake production facility

861
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Stop

862
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,872
So it came to a screaming halt worse than that

863
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
I had to come up with $100,000

864
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
To take my get my inventory out of the building

865
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,344
Because again we owe them co-packing fees now the banks the owner

866
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,416
And so I had to go call my shareholders

867
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
And

868
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
Find $100,000 within hours

869
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
And so I did

870
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
We got our inventory out

871
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,520
And that but now we have no Factory yet you're making no yogurt we have no yogurt we have what was in the factory

872
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,872
What can we do if we took a look at the old yogurt work

873
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Hilltop Farm

874
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
Where the roosters were now living as his son of a gun we got to come back here now by then our volume had grown to 100% more

875
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:41,440
You know when winter has been exceeded you could not make enough yogurt at Stonyfield Farm where you were

876
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Right right

877
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:48,096
But that didn't dantas that we can send me when I put on our Carpenters aprons went out

878
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
And kick the roosters out and restarted the old yogurt

879
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Fortunately the equipment was still there

880
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
And

881
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,104
By Monday morning so it was $100,000 that we had to

882
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Borrow to

883
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Payoff

884
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
The dairy

885
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
And then we had to put about

886
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
$100,000 into getting this place

887
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
Up and running again we

888
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,184
You know we borrowed and borrowed and borrowed and you know I went to all the shareholders and

889
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
You know what course

890
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,304
They have no choice but to land because everything they had ever put in was

891
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Monday morning

892
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
We begin

893
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
Action against Stonyfield Farm now

894
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
The problem is

895
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
In order to keep up we have to

896
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
Mapreduce

897
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Twenty-four hours a day

898
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
7 days a week

899
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
Assembler I had to make yogurt every other night

900
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
And guy this began

901
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
And continued

902
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
420 months

903
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
And we've started burning

904
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
Embrace yourself for this

905
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
You started burning $25,000 a week

906
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
On top of the 200000 that we had borrowed

907
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
So now I am in

908
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,376
Deep you-know-what and

909
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
How much money do you think you

910
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
You weren't at that

911
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Like a million

912
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Dora Moore

913
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Well by the

914
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
Bike by Christmas of 87

915
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
You know running this Factory for 2 months

916
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
I can tell you we were already

917
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
A $600,000 in debt

918
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
By Christmas of 88

919
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,184
We were a 1.9 million dollars in debt

920
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
Bye

921
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000

Of the next year

923
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
We were 2.7

924
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Million-dollar

925
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
Can you put shareholders

926
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Say

927
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm getting nervous

928
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
IQR

929
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Has it been a while here

930
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Every one of them

931
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:42,016
And you know you what you have to know at the punchline of the story is that I wound up by the end of this.

932
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
With 297 individual investor

933
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,416
There was no way to find common ground with an Institutional Investor

934
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
How to write a venture capital

935
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Believe me I

936
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,024
I knocked on every door and they were like take a hike

937
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Right

938
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
What about your shoulder

939
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
How did you end up dealing with

940
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
I

941
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
Stayed in constant touch with

942
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
Every single shareholder

943
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,360
I was in constant contact with my creditors I couldn't pay fruit suppliers I couldn't pay

944
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
You know our fruit supplier had lost

945
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,736
$75,000 when that Dairy went chapter 7

946
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
And somehow

947
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
They had

948
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
Not been paying attention and they

949
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Continue to ship us fruit back up at the farm

950
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
So they

951
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
They figured it out you know

952
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
3 months later

953
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,096
They were now into us for 125000

954
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
And I

955
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
I said lucky

956
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
I can't pay it but

957
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
Can I come out and talk to you

958
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
And I borrowed a credit card

959
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
From a friend

960
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,104
And flew out cuz we've certainly had no credit

961
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
So that the Cleveland and met with the

962
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,504
People and I said look here's the bad news we owe you a hundred twenty five thousand

963
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
But here's the good news

964
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,344
Meseta current growth rate

965
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
If we can meet orders

966
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
We will be a 250

967
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
$50,000 a year customer for you

968
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Within six months

969
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
So here's what I'm prepared to do

970
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
I would like to see if you would Advance us

971
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Another

972
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
$125,000 a

973
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
I will pay you back

974
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
Starting a 6 months at your interest

975
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
Whatever you want to charge which is a joke cuz nobody

976
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
No Commercial Bank would even lend to us

977
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
I said I will

978
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
Pledge my stock as collateral

979
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
Which is a joke cuz it was a liability not an asset

980
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:27,232
And finally I said and I will pledge that I will buy exclusively from you

981
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
Not from anyone else so that was a joke

982
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
Cuz no one else would ever sell to us

983
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
And they said well Gary it's an interesting

984
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,008
They said could you mind if we go out and talk and they went into the back room

985
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:44,640
And son of a gun half an hour later they come outside you know what we believe in you were going to do it

986
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:50,272
And am I at in my summary of that story and so many others of this. Is simply

987
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
If you don't ask you don't get

988
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,440
And Desperation you know breeds this thing or you just have no shame anymore you have to

989
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
Asking now I'll just tell you the punchline of that story is those guys have sold Us in the 30-year

990
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Dear sense

991
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
And if so

992
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Probably

993
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,752
250 or 300 million dollars worth of fruit

994
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:17,664
It's crazy because at this point in in all of my interviews normally

995
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:22,272
It's were talking about how the entrepreneur like made it through the troughs in the

996
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,160
Crucibles and just you know to start making money hand-over-fist but you are still in crisis I mean your

997
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Company is

998
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
Somebody doing well

999
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
You didn't even have a factory to make yogurt at this point you you needed a new one

1000
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Yeah

1001
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
Nme ultimately found one

1002
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
It was a dairy in Northern Vermont

1003
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
And

1004
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
We

1005
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
Negotiated for three months with this dairy in Northern Vermont

1006
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
To become the answer

1007
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Go to this whole thing

1008
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Namely

1009
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
They would produce our yogurt

1010
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
Samuel and I would focus on sales and marketing

1011
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,160
And we would become partners and they would get

1012
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952
Pay the price for every cup

1013
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Tokyo Garden

1014
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
Just like the other day but this was a much larger

1015
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
70 million-dollar company

1016
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
So D day comes

1017
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
In April of 88

1018
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
To go up and get the

1019
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,496
Steel sign and we had negotiated a deal

1020
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
About to in

1021
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
And I went up

1022
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Gemini

1023
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,408
Left the farm at this point Meg is pregnant with

1024
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Son number one

1025
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
And

1026
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
Of course I've got now

1027
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
I now have over $1000000 of her mother's money

1028
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Okay

1029
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
Like money she could never

1030
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Everything they had

1031
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,048
And a man comes to me at the door and as we're leaving

1032
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,608
She said you eat you promise this is done right we're going to

1033
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,656
Because I've been milking every other night

1034
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
Right no vacations no brakes no no

1035
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,776
I'm leaving now to go sign the stalemate

1036
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
You promise me that

1037
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
All the details are worked up

1038
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
That when you come back tonight

1039
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Where

1040
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
The beginning of

1041
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Relief is going to have

1042
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
Absolutely we have nailed down every last

1043
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Drove up to Vermont

1044
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
When I got there Sammy one of the rest

1045
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Restroom at the lawyer's office

1046
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
And I looked at my

1047
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
Instead of a 2 inch thick

1048
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Agreement that we were going to go over

1049
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
It was a letter

1050
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Timmy

1051
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,399
It said dear Gary and bottom line is

1052
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Aaron Samuel

1053
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
Basically they decided to trade

1054
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
Just to steal the company from us there there

1055
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
They said we've decided

1056
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
That you guys need us more than we need you

1057
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
We're going to

1058
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
Take over what we're going to do is have all of your shareholders convert there

1059
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
Stock into debt

1060
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
And you are welcome to work down there.

1061
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
With a credit of one penny

1062
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
Perk-up Forever Yogurt

1063
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Every time I we figure it will take 2 years

1064
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,607
And at the end of the two years will negotiate your future employer

1065
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
So it wasn't a deal it was

1066
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Bastille

1067
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Wow

1068
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
Wait this is this was just sitting

1069
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,287
On the table this letter that said

1070
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
Aphorism

1071
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
This is

1072
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
We were stealing

1073
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:02,271
And all the while they're looking at me and that one guys winking at me like you know do the deal sign

1074
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
In your best

1075
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,391
You know your wife's back there desperate for you to solve this get this

1076
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Be smart

1077
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,719
Tell me about not even come into the room I got up

1078
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,583
I heard some things I can't say on public radio and grab Samuel

1079
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
And got in the car

1080
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,191
And we started driving now course as luck would have it

1081
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
Don't you know an April blizzard has started in

1082
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
So no cars are on the road we've now got

1083
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
A two-hour drive back

1084
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
And worse than that one of us is going to have to make yogurt at night

1085
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
And worse than that

1086
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
I have to face my wife

1087
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,575
And so we start driving

1088
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
I turned him I said what what will you do now cuz

1089
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,743
I knew we're going to have to sign the deal I I knew it was over

1090
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
And I said

1091
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
And he said

1092
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
I guess I'll do something in sales

1093
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,935
And you know my heart suck right this is a guy who created this

1094
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:57,311
Incredible yogurt I mean he was a genius who is making the most perfect product and now he's going to sell widgets

1095
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
So you basically thought

1096
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
Or at least

1097
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
Sam thought that

1098
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
This was it I mean you guys were mean

1099
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
This is the darkest of the dark

1100
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,111
Hours for burning $25,000 a week

1101
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
We're taking money we cannot ever pay back

1102
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
We have to go back to the storm we have no solution

1103
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
And so I turned to Samuel and I said listen Samuel

1104
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,423
Just for the fun of it what would be the cheapest yogurt plant we could build

1105
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,239
Somewhere that would actually cover our capacity

1106
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
They said you know

1107
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,175
I was thinking the same thing so he flipped on the dome light in the car pulls out his pad and we start designing a yogurt

1108
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,247
In the car in the car we're driving in this

1109
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
I'm driving he's designing

1110
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
We got back to the house

1111
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
About

1112
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
10:30 11:00 at night

1113
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
He goes in to make yogurt

1114
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,255
I going to see Meg shoes

1115
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Wakes up in

1116
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
She says

1117
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,119
So the deal signed is it done I said no no no

1118
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,679
That is not going to happen but we've got a much better idea

1119
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,751
I slept alone that night

1120
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,799
Over my office

1121
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
And the next morning

1122
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
At 7 a.m.

1123
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
I was up

1124
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
At the SBA office

1125
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
In Concord New Hampshire the small business

1126
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
Administration remember they

1127
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
They will guarantee loans too busy

1128
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
So they make it possible

1129
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
For banks to lend

1130
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
2 high risk

1131
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
But you certainly were

1132
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
And you were I mean you you guys were in

1133
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
That's you

1134
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
You had no plan to come for your orders

1135
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
How are you going to talk them into

1136
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Into giving you a loan

1137
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,215
Well we had figured out that we could build this

1138
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Factory

1139
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
For a 500 and

1140
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
$97,000

1141
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
So I drove up

1142
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
2

1143
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
Cspa and I

1144
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Sat down with them and they never

1145
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,343
Normally you don't go to the sbu go to the bank to go CSP but I sat down

1146
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
You know Stonyfield the pretty

1147
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
Popular brand we're well known in the state so I

1148
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,583
I meet Bill Phillips the head of the New Hampshire SBA office when he walked in at 7:30 and I said

1149
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Bill

1150
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
Here's the deal

1151
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,423
We can build this Factory

1152
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,495
For 597 thousand we need an 85% loan Guerra

1153
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,799
And guess what we've got a bag

1154
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,127
The back of New England's willing to lend us that was a little bit of an exaggerated

1155
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Jason day

1156
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
This is Stone Soup

1157
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Do you know the story

1158
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
I said Anna and and I knew

1159
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
That I had to come up with

1160
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
20% of 8

1161
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
Shareholder

1162
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
Equity so

1163
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,999
And I said I've got the hundred thousand hundred twenty five thousand from the shareholders also not quite sure

1164
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,303
Bill sample dysentery

1165
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
If you got the bag and you've got this

1166
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Plan and

1167
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
And you've got the

1168
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,263
Shareholders and will happily do it I drove from there to the Bank of New England

1169
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Set timer to look guys

1170
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
The

1171
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
SBA

1172
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,943
Is going to provide the loan guarantee and I got the Cheryl this will you

1173
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Do this loan

1174
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,295
And they still at the SPCA of the word of course we'll do it and if you

1175
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
You guarantee the equity will do

1176
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:52,671
Call the shareholders to a meeting in Boston the next night

1177
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,791
Get together with as many of them as I could had my mother-in-law on speakerphone

1178
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
Here we are guys

1179
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
We got the bag

1180
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
We got the SBA all we need is your hundred twenty five thousand

1181
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
And

1182
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
To make a long story short

1183
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
We got their money

1184
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
How much money did you raise

1185
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
All told

1186
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
Including paying off the debt

1187
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
Two and a half million dollars

1188
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,015
And opened our new Factory nine months later

1189
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
In Londonderry

1190
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
Where we are today

1191
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
And did you both yuan Samuel

1192
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,671
Give up big chunks of Iran

1193
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
Oh yeah by then Samuel and I were down

1194
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
To 10% each

1195
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
In the company

1196
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,375
Now we also had stock options like wheat we hadn't turned back

1197
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,983
The end of 89 we began Manufacturing in this facility

1198
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
The business is now doing

1199
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
3.4 million dollars

1200
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Who sells

1201
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,407
But we lost 1.4 million that year

1202
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
The next year

1203
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
We did 6.5 million in sales

1204
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
And we lost

1205
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
900000

1206
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,671
The following year the second full year in the new Factory

1207
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,023
We did 10.1 million and we made $125,000

1208
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
This is 1992

1209
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
March 92

1210
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
That that was our first year making money

1211
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
To the nineties are this is just

1212
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:15,103
The growth. You guys are on the trajectory and when do you know that you are not sustainable and

1213
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Things Are

1214
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
Are looking at

1215
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
We hit

1216
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
40

1217
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,039
4 million dollars in around 95

1218
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
Now we've got

1219
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,671
Stability and cash flow and this gave us the courage

1220
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
To go back to our roots

1221
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,583
Initially with one farmer and eventually now with 1755

1222
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,935
Begin buying organic milk again and of course organic has evolved at this point

1223
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,031
Whole Foods has become a reality and the organic sectors

1224
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Real

1225
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
So

1226
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,175
In 95 we converted back are playing home of Courts do organic

1227
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,503
96 we converted our small cups

1228
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
97 relaunch

1229
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Strength

1230
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,135
98 worth 78 million and sales

1231
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,719
99 or 100 million + sales

1232
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
And that's

1233
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
When I

1234
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,583
Begin negotiating with done on

1235
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
2

1236
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
Have them come in

1237
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
At this point

1238
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,983
It's been a long road right 83 you start the company

1239
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,311
You get a hundred million sales by 99

1240
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,639
What was the reason why you decided to sell

1241
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,199
You know huge steak toot-toot

1242
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,503
Down to the French multinational

1243
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,063
Is yogurt

1244
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Dairy products

1245
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
So the answer is

1246
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,903
The 297 shareholder

1247
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
I mean some of these folks

1248
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Kman

1249
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
In 1984

1250
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Without

1251
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,375
Children now they have kids going to college right I mean they

1252
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
Do you need a return on

1253
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
I had no legal

1254
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
Application but I felt a moral obligation

1255
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Shinto

1256
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,127
No pay them back and Samuel also was ready to retire

1257
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
I'm so

1258
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
My idea was

1259
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
I'll sell

1260
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:00,063
My company to you you buy out all the shareholders in my partner

1261
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,367
But you leave me in control

1262
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,439
By then I was up to about 20% ownership

1263
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
Diet through the ER now

1264
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
And I said

1265
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
United

1266
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Commitment I'll stay on for a really long time

1267
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
But you got to let me keep running the shop

1268
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
So I talked

1269
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
21 companies 20 of them laugh

1270
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,567
Actually even done on left to maybe

1271
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,639
The original head of m&a who came to see me said that

1272
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,199
Gary do you mean to tell me

1273
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:31,039
We're going to buy 80% of your company and you'll still be on

1274
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Core

1275
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
And I said yes

1276
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
And the banker and the lawyers and everyone laughed and

1277
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:40,511
You know two years later that's the deal we signed I spent two years negotiating with them

1278
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,071
So you remained the CEO of the company

1279
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
And up I mean in mm

1280
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
I guess I have my server

1281
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
Remember this

1282
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
Like all of a sudden

1283
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
Greek yogurt chest

1284
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Loaded

1285
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
And you guys

1286
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
We're not a Greek yogurt

1287
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
What did that

1288
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
Due to your

1289
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Sales

1290
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,271
Well Greek is not 50% of the yogurt

1291
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
The thick

1292
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
Unusual creamy

1293
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
Taste of Greek

1294
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Just

1295
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Just caught on

1296
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
It just simply caught on

1297
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,303
And we have a wonderful incredible Greek line

1298
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631
But it's only for us about 15% of our sales

1299
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
And you know

1300
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
While we're not

1301
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,007
The leader in Greek we are the leader in organic

1302
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
I think we're something like

1303
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
80% of organic yogurt in the US

1304
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,199
How much of what happens to you and your successes be

1305
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
Because of luck and how much because of skill

1306
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Oh

1307
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,063
Blood counts for a lot of mean

1308
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
I was lucky to meet my

1309
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
Incredible wife and

1310
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
Turn amazing mother I was lucky to

1311
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
Samuel I was

1312
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,559
We were lucky to find people who lend us

1313
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Money despite how

1314
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Silly this was

1315
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Skill helps you know

1316
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
What made this possible was Samuel

1317
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
And his genius and his incredible skills

1318
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
Okay without that Superior recipe

1319
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,151
None of this could have happened where you and I wouldn't be talking to herself

1320
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Of course kill counts but

1321
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,527
You know school has plenty of fantastic entrepreneurs who

1322
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
Failed hue

1323
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Wonderful skills

1324
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
But just did

1325
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Have good luck

1326
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
This

1327
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
Small little hippie like yogurt saying that you

1328
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
The 1983

1329
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,375
Has made you very wealthy

1330
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,447
First of all was that ever important to you did you

1331
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
Do you always want to become rich out of this

1332
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359
All I wanted was my mother and my mother-in-law to get their money back now

1333
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,943
I could you not know look you know we began this

1334
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Interview by talking about my father

1335
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
His failed business and all that

1336
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
Tragedy

1337
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Came of that

1338
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
With all the people in my

1339
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Community Center

1340
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
You know I

1341
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
I was never

1342
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,279
A believer that making money was the Holy Grail

1343
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,887
You know I sit on many boards now I work with wall streeters and

1344
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,167
Look I know the

1345
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,983
Best way to convince these guys to invest in organic and

1346
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,567
Renovus is to show you can make a lot of money so and that's

1347
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,383
Basically we did me despite all these obstacles

1348
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
You guys hate

1349
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Yeah

1350
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,319
Laughing joke that we had a wonderful company just no Supply and no demand and no one knew that

1351
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,647
There was such a thing as better yogurt and certainly no one who would organic

1352
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
I am yet

1353
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
It's interesting that my dad

1354
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,047
And my mom by the way in both cases

1355
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,863
What I now realize I got from them was this

1356
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,167
Belief in myself that

1357
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
It didn't matter what we

1358
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
What's going to happen

1359
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
If if yogurt cups were leaking if

1360
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,151
Stores weren't accepting us if competition was coming on if I

1361
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Couldn't meet payroll

1362
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,527
You know there was always going to be away and I I learned that from both

1363
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,343
And and your your mother lies she still wrapped

1364
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Sabishii just passed

1365
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
A couple months ago

1366
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
I'm sorry to hear I'm assuming that $4000000 was

1367
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
In the end of very good in

1368
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,327
She did extremely well see you

1369
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,631
She and I still Kept Secrets I was

1370
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
She passed it to nearly 97

1371
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
And

1372
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
I can tell you that

1373
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
The risk she took

1374
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
What's

1375
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
County Fair was probably whenever

1376
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,223
Greatest point of this conversation and

1377
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
And Meg

1378
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,111
Begging and pleading her mother not to mess and Doris always had this one line what she had for

1379
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
Decades witches

1380
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
Maggie I'm a big girl

1381
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
I know what I'm doing

1382
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
It's going to work out

1383
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,655
And she was right Gary hirshberg co-founder of Stonyfield yogurt

1384
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:37,055
Earlier this year did know and sold Stonyfield to another company called like Talus one of the big

1385
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
Biggest Dairy companies in the world

1386
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
And the amount like Talus

1387
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Paid for Stonyfield

1388
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,015
875 million dollars

1389
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:50,111
Which is not bad for yogurt business that began with just

1390
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
1 Cal

1391
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,887
And please stick around because in just a moment

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1403
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
And this week our story starts

1404
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
At the movies

1405
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
I've seen it where Harrison Ford is

1406
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
Stuck in a room is

1407
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Burst into flames

1408
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,455
2/3 to the scooters chair to the only place that is not

1409
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
On fire

1410
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,759
Which is the stone fireplace

1411
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
And then and I think you know where I'm going with this

1412
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
The fireplace

1413
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Sentinelese

1414
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Spin

1415
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,511
In Indiana is a whole new room in this room

1416
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
It's full of Nazis so this movie

1417
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,191
It was informative for Steve humble

1418
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,775
Steve is a mechanical engineer and a few years ago

1419
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,895
He was living in Salt Lake City renting a big house with some friends

1420
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:21,503
There was a spot in the house that was a big Stone Hearth

1421
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,599
I have always been kind of fascinated with secret passageways

1422
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:30,463
And I thought I could totally make a secret passageway like what I seen the Last Crusade

1423
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,607
Because let's face it how awesome would it be to have a secret passageway in your house

1424
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,679
In the more Steve Mueller over the more he thought

1425
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
I've been other people who want one too so the first thing you did was to Google secret passageway build

1426
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:52,479
Holding companies and there was nobody absolutely nobody anywhere that could make be secret doors

1427
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:58,879
We're in the movies you know motorized and and maybe high-security stuff

1428
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Where is Beijing

1429
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:05,023
So he started to dream of creating a business that would build secret passageways

1430
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:11,423
And he called up some contractor friends or clients possibly be interested in something like

1431
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,823
This and I got overwhelmingly positive feedback So eventually you know I I just

1432
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
Decided I'm going to do this thing

1433
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
I quit my job

1434
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
I had to move

1435
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:27,039
In with my parents do you move to his parents place in Mesa Arizona

1436
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:33,439
Restart the tinker and his dad's garage and it just so happened in an old high school buddy was building a house nearby

1437
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Pyside

1438
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,535
Hate why don't I build you a secret hiding place

1439
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,863
He had a niche in wall at a recess

1440
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,447
And he kept a vase in there

1441
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:49,311
And I made it so that when you twist the vase a painting on the wall opens

1442
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:53,151
And it exposed fingerprint scanner and then when you scanned your print

1443
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:58,783
The niche itself would slide upwards towards the ceiling and it was replaced

1444
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,623
From the low buy a gun safe hidden gun safe

1445
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,207
Took this point Steve started to Market his idea

1446
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,535
You got a story in a local paper and within a year

1447
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:15,935
People started to find them big people with people you would have heard of and they are building multimillion-dollar

1448
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:22,335
Dollar houses course we ask them for the salacious details but I wish I could name

1449
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:28,735
Are you ready I am sworn to secrecy

1450
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:35,135
Palatial homes putting in false and fingerprint scanners and secret doors for people whose name

1451
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,927
When's he cannot reveal

1452
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:41,535
I felt a little bit like an imposter you know I show up at this house where there's

1453
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,935
This incredible team of talent but I kept reminding myself that nobody knows

1454
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,335
How to make secret passageways any better than I do certainly no one's built any more than I have so I guess I am

1455
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
The expert advice

1456
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,455
A custom-made Secret Door starts at around $9,000

1457
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,855
But Steve's recently introduced a cheaper line of the secret doors just 1,500 bucks and the

1458
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
Lisa look like anything other than the door

1459
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,975
One is a full length mirror

1460
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:17,375
One is a bookcase one is a wardrobe and another one

1461
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
