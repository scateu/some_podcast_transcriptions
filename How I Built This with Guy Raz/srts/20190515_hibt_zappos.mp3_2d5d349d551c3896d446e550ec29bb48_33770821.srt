After a year of doing live shows

17
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832

Go to Summit. Npr.org

64
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
So you probably heard of or maybe even ordered

65
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Zappos

66
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
And if you've heard was found

67
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Then you'll know that

68
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,632
His Mantra is that Zappos is a customer service company

69
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
It happens

70
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
To sell shoes

71
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
If you haven't heard this episode of

72
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
Before

73
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
The Tony doesn't really care about

74
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Shoes

75
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Two pairs

76
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
He's a huge introvert

77
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
Anything some self is a very

78
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Weird guy

79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
And also he lives in an Airstream trailer

80
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
In all these factors

81
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
A part of his very quiet

82
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Very quirky personality

83
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Explain Zappos unorthodox

84
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Management style

85
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
This is a great episode and it's

86
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
First air

87
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
January 8th

88
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
2017

89
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Enjoy

90
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,800
As Zappos was growing

91
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
It was also losing my money and we also need my money for

92
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,736
Inventory and so all of this was happening at a bad time in terms of the

93
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Dot-com crash back in 2000 so is pretty much impossible to raise money from anyone you could not get

94
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
Investment

95
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,536
Even if someone wanted to invest in an internet company the last thing they wanted

96
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Online shoe company

97
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
No one would ever buy shoes online

98
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist

99
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Stories behind the movements they built

100
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
I'm guy Roz and how old school mail-order catalogs inspired Tony hsieh to build

101
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
One of the world's biggest online shoe retailers

102
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
You know it

103
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Zappos

104
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Billions

105
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
You only have

106
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Four pairs

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Is that the rice

108
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah roughly Maybe

109
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
If you are now

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
But what kind of shoes you wearing now

111
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Right now I'm wearing black ASICS

112
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
I have a pair of

113
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm actually not talking about shoes at all

114
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Investment customer service and Company

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Talk forever about

116
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Those two things but I can't

117
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,007
Choose okay so as you just heard one of the most successful

118
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Shoe salesman in the world

119
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
I care about you

120
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
And also

121
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
He's really quiet

122
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Nice app

123
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Write definitely

124
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
How do you cope with a new computer company

125
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
When you got to talk about the people Inspire them like how do you find the

126
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Energy to do that

127
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm probably different from a lot of

128
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
Goodwill CEOs where

129
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,143
Analogy of a greenhouse where maybe I

130
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Company

131
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Paseo

132
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Ibiza

133
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Strongest

134
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Tallest

135
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Most charismatic plant that all the other

136
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
Strive to

137
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
One Day become Maybe

138
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
And for me I really

139
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Taking my role

140
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
As more about being the

141
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Architect of the greenhouse and then

142
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,975
The other pens inside will flourish and thrive on their own and so from a I guess

143
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Comfy prospective buyer charges

144
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,423
With people that are just naturally more extroverted and a little bit

145
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
We're too because I heard that when you apply to Zappos

146
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Test how weird you are

147
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
I believe so yeah I think our application

148
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Pause button

149
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
As far as I know.

150
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Question still there

151
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
So on a scale of 1 to 10 how weird are you

152
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
I would say maybe in

153
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
8

154
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
There you have it

155
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
Tony Chabot the guy who built this huge company with more than a thousand employees doesn't really like shoes

156
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Is he's an 8 on the weird scale and an introvert and people who study companies and

157
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
Company culture come from all over the world

158
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,919
2 Zappos to 2/10 quarters in Las Vegas to see how it operates

159
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Because as many of you know at Zappos

160
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,599
There are no typical bosses employees have a lot of autonomy to make decisions

161
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
But at the same time

162
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
About customer service

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,303
As you will hear even think of itself as a shoe company

164
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Basically

165
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Is a company that sells good customer service

166
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
In the story of how Tony got there

167
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Begins as these stories often do

168
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
In childhood

169
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Asian-American parents

170
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
Practicing piano and violin and other instruments and

171
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
During the Summers for example practice 1 hour

172
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
1 hour violin and

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,487
And this is as a kid summer vacation and so

174
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
I would actually

175
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Get up super early

176
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
And

177
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
I would actually just

178
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Play back a recording of myself

179
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Violin

180
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
What you'd play Eric

181
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,567
Recording of you practicing the violin to give your parenting impression that you were

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Actually practicing the violin

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Right so because they were

184
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Sleeping but they get here so

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,063
So that was my way around that it's like a Ferris Bueller movie

186
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
And strangely

187
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
Every week when I went to piano lessons or violin

188
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,535
And so the teachers I understand why

189
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
So anyway Tony eventually goes off

190
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
College

191
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Graduates

192
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
In the mid-1990s

193
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
And it's not like he goes right into starting Zappos

194
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
That first

195
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
He goes to work for Oracle as a low-level program

196
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
I wasn't there for very long I think I was there for

197
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
For five months and it's just straight out of college and

198
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,319
The actual work I was assigned to do was

199
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,159
Pretty boring and this is right about when

200
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
The internet

201
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Is the World Wide Web

202
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Started

203
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
I remember

204
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,119
Didn't even really exist I don't think the summer before or at least two summers before

205
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
And at the time these web design and hosting

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
These were popping up left and right and so

207
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Sunday

208
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Decided to do that on the side while we were both our day jobs were at Oracle but during lunch breaks in at night

209
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Would go

210
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Start selling

211
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Designing websites for

212
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
Local small businesses

213
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Yeah and then we had this idea for

214
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
I at the time

215
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Advertising online

216
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Very very very

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Today if you go to

218
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Any website

219
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
She adds all over the place but

220
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,543
Back in the day if you went to a website and it had an advertisement on it

221
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
Was actually kind of a badge of honor because only the really big

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Websites

223
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Yahoo

224
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
Have advertising customers wait till you guys were trying to build it like a web-based ad sales company

225
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Ashley's

226
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Intend to start

227
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
More of those things we were bored in

228
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,559
Let's try this and see what happens and so we literally just

229
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Contacted you a hundred random websites.

230
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Interesting

231
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Maven contact

232
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Reba

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Back then people

234
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
Dresses on the website

235
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Like what Master El Rio

236
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
What was your pitch when you email them

237
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Basically that we're trying this thing out and

238
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
You just

239
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
This little piece of code into the your website banners will start showing up

240
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
You send us your banner and

241
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
Make sure that it's showing up on other websites doing the same thing

242
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
We weren't really trying to

243
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Pet show asb

244
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Would you in this experiment you want to

245
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Participate

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
Okay so just so I understand you you basically got like a lot of small websites to join kind of a network and then

247
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Agree to run ads on their site

248
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,295
And you were like the middle that right you sold those spaces on website

249
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Companies that want to advertise

250
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Yeah

251
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Wow

252
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Friendly Goods

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Hanover

254
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,535
Two and a half years we end up going to come pick me up which was called link Exchange

255
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
It's about a hundred or so people

256
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
And then

257
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Apparently ended up selling the company to Microsoft

258
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
+ 90

259
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
1998

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
426

261
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
5 million

262
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
This is not how this narrative is supposed to go

263
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
I mean you are so young

264
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
3 years after you graduate from college so

265
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,831
I totally overwhelming that that that that happened so quick

266
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
The whole thing definitely seem very surreal but

267
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
At the same time

268
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,535
What a lot of people don't know is the real reason why we ended up selling the company

269
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
And

270
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
The real reason was

271
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Because

272
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Company culture

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
Dragon completely downhill and

274
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
I myself try to getting out of bed in the morning

275
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Go to my own comfy

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Which is kind of a weird feeling

277
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Because when I was

278
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
Just five or ten and we were all friends

279
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
A lot of fun we were

280
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
Typical.com startup

281
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Back and we were sleeping under desk that no idea

282
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Weekly was

283
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Work around the clock but it is

284
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Really exciting in

285
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Fun drawing and as we started

286
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Highmark

287
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
People we eventually ran out of

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Either friends or

289
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Friends of friends in

290
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
So how to do it

291
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
How to do interviews and so on in

292
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
Not everyone we hired was good for

293
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Culture and by the time we got 200 people

294
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
It wasn't anyone's fault

295
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Death by a thousand

296
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Does Cassandra paper cuts and

297
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
That's really what led to the sale

298
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Taupe Subway what do you just like

299
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Cashed out and moved on

300
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
Well in Silicon Valley

301
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
Usually there's a four-year

302
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Soon as a 4 year vesting for

303
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
Your stocking I'd only been there for a 2 and 1/2 years

304
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
So

305
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Really had to stay for another

306
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Going to have after Microsoft

307
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Acquire.

308
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
In order to get the

309
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Full amount of

310
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
What the deal was

311
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
But I ended up at

312
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
You just walk away from

313
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
That way

314
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
I guess I could have

315
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Usually just sat around for

316
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
For your nap

317
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
But I was

318
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Buddy 2

319
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Move on to the next

320
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
So just to be clear you you could have made

321
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Much more money if you had stayed for

322
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Another year-and-a-half

323
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
You walked away because

324
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Cuz you were miserable

325
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah I think I just started going down

326
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
The past of just trying to make sure that I'm

327
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
Intrude myself and

328
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Doing things

329
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Because

330
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
It's what I want to do versus what is

331
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Maybe

332
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Status symbol

333
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Or

334
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
What Society

335
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Expects me to do

336
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
I ain't the one resource that we all

337
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
We have the same

338
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Time

339
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
10 yd waste

340
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Okay so fair enough

341
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
You part ways with link Exchange

342
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,303
An Endeavor that you open an incubator like where you invested in other companies

343
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Adventure frogs

344
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,239
And we race about 27 million roughly half of that was

345
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
My money and then the other half was from

346
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Other early

347
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Link exchange employees

348
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
Add money from the acquisition

349
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,063
And for me when I first got started in that my thinking was so this will be lots of fun

350
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
Oceans of lots of different Founders in different internet company

351
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
But what I realized was that for me

352
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
Actually found that investing was pretty

353
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,887
Boring and I felt like I was sitting on the sidelines all the time and I really miss being part of

354
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
Building something on your radar

355
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Almost actually

356
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
Didn't get on our radar because I remember getting a voicemail

357
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
From

358
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Founders apus

359
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,039
He said he had this idea for selling shoes online and we were getting random

360
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Pictures

361
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Everyday and so

362
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
It seemed like maybe

363
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Custard powder bad

364
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Gladius who's going to actually

365
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Try on shoes without seeing them in in person

366
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
And

367
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,911
Right before hitting the delete button on on the phone at Heathrow

368
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
That made us change your mind one was that Footwear

369
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
At the time was

370
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
40 billion dollar a year industry in the US

371
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
And I'm not into shoes at all so that was

372
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
News to me

373
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
And then the other interesting fact was that

374
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
At the time

375
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
Mail-order catalogs with paper

376
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Allies

377
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
That was actually the fastest growing segment of the Footwear industry in the US and

378
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,023
That represented 5% so 2 billion dollars a year

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
And growing

380
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
And if there's clear proof that

381
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
People are going to

382
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Remotely

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Try on shoes

384
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
And so in our minds

385
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
Internet is going to be

386
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Much bigger than just paper

387
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
Order catalogs and so

388
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
That's what made us ultimately decide to invest

389
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Okay so when

390
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
When the founder of Zappos next

391
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
What's windburn

392
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
For the first time what

393
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Motion Pro

394
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
He just seemed like a pretty casual guide

395
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
We listen just said

396
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
MCU

397
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Next don't have any Footwear background

398
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
On base if you can find a shoe guy

399
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Turn that that there's a shoe guy name

400
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Fred Mosley

401
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Who was working at Nordstrom at the time and

402
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
He told Nick

403
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
I'll join in

404
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
You find an investor and so

405
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Are we on

406
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Smelly friends

407
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
The company and

408
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Working with Fred

409
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Wow so so at what point did you realize that

410
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
You know you want to be more than just

411
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
The passive investor that you wanted to be involved in the company

412
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
There wasn't really any one moment in time it was more

413
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
We were also running an incubator at the time and Zappos ended up

414
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Moving in and

415
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
On the same building and so we just

416
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Started being able to help them or in

417
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Slowly

418
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Just evolve but it it was gradual thing it wasn't like

419
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
One day

420
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Wasn't really helping

421
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Next day it was

422
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
Like a time when people are still kind of

423
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
Freaked out about using credit cards online right so

424
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
In in the first year of that company where you actually selling shoes

425
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Yeah I mean

426
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
So in order to test out the hole

427
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Concept for real

428
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Nick with Ashley

429
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Just got down to the local shoe store

430
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:16,127
Take pictures of all the shoes that were on the wall and then put it on the website and if someone bought something then go down to the local shoe store

431
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
Buy the shoe event and ship it

432
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Obviously

433
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Not making money from each of those but it was really

434
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Really cheap and easy way to

435
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Test the actual

436
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Demand

437
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
So that's how you would get

438
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
User gauge what

439
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,095
Your mom finally just whether they buy shoes online at all

440
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,191
And over time we've learned what brands they were interested in and then eventually

441
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Got to the point where

442
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,311
We wanted to make money and so

443
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Burning through cash

444
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
Respond to how are you finding the

445
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
So after the link exchange sale

446
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Set the money aside

447
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
For investing and also

448
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Bought a bunch of

449
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Apartments or Lofts that were in that same building

450
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
In San Francisco

451
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah this is right in San Francisco

452
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
And I'm basically

453
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
As Zappos

454
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Growing

455
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,543
It was also losing my money and we also need more money for inventory and so

456
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
I ended up one by one selling off the apartments in

457
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,015
Sound like when in Monopoly when you you buy hotel or houses and then you have to sell them

458
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Lose money on the sale

459
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
That's basically what would her

460
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
So how many permits do you have to sell

461
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,767
All of them eventually really believe this thing was going to work

462
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,167
Yeah well so all this was happening at a bad time in terms of the.com Crash back in

463
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Mm psoas

464
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Pretty much impossible

465
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Raise money from anyone

466
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
And there was also 911

467
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
And

468
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
War in

469
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
Basically it's just

470
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Abandoned

471
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Economic environment and especially

472
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Recommend

473
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
As investment

474
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,135
No and also the huge companies like

475
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Pets.com never eCommerce dead

476
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
We're kind of imploding at the time and so

477
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Even if

478
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
Someone wanted to invest in

479
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,631
Internet company the last thing they wanted to do was invested

480
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Online shoe company

481
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
No one would ever buy shoes online

482
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
When we come back in the moment

483
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
The secret sauce that helped

484
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Zappos

485
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Blow up

486
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
And a hint

487
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
It had nothing to do

488
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Which shoes

489
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927

00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Mitsubishi Maine

532
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255

Stream NPR

538

Gyros

539
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
The early 2000s

540
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
And Zappos

541
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Struggling

542
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
Economy isn't doing well and

543
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
Basically at this time Tony hsieh is funding the company with his own money he's doing that

544
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
By selling up a bunch of apartments that he owes

545
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
There's a

546
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
This was not a good time for the company

547
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
Did I mean every week or two we had to make a choice between do we make payroll or do we pay half of our vendors

548
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Or 3 sell another apartment

549
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
But you can

550
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Just selling apartment overnight user

551
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,527
So did you actually have to lay people off it in those early days

552
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Yeah with him

553
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
First a couple years

554
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
The reality of

555
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
You really are out of cash and we're out of

556
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Options and so

557
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,584
How to do a layoff notices to come take down

558
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,264
Even begin to turn it around how did you get to a place where you were able to make it sustainable

559
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
I think for us

560
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Addicting point was

561
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Spell deciding

562
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
We wanted to build a brand to be about

563
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
The very best customer service in

564
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,760
That wasn't baked into the model

565
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
From the beginning

566
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
They came later

567
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,392
Ganso in the beginning we always wanted to offer a good service but

568
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
It wasn't

569
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
Until we decided we wanted to build our

570
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
That's what we

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Ashley wanted a grant to be about that

572
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
The most important thing

573
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
It led us to do a lot of things that

574
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Would not have made

575
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
Any sense if that wasn't on your starting so

576
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Examples would be

577
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Offering free shipping both ways

578
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Cuz

579
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Very expensive to do and

580
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
We were just around trying to say maximize the

581
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,904
Profit margins than we've never would have gone down that path

582
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
And yes we would have made more money in the short-term gern

583
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
Those days but then we can have

584
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Dog bark

585
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Brandon Ray

586
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Occasionally

587
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
I think

588
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
When you actually

589
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,264
Want your brand to stand for something or just have some sort of purpose

590
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Anarchist

591
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
It's about to be about the very best customer service and cuts

592
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
You do things that

593
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
Kind of nonsensical

594
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
That your competition wouldn't

595
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Yes it's there was a point where you really just

596
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Find yourself like

597
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
This is your this is what sets our company

598
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
CNN

599
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
There's actually a phrase that

600
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
I think one of the employees in iron

601
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Call center Ashley

602
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Came up with

603
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Started describing us as

604
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,216
Weir service company that just happens to sell shoes

605
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
And so for us

606
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
That's

607
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,408
But we're having 10-20 years now people won't even realize we started selling shoes online and

608
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Imagine one day there could be a Zappos

609
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
Airlines are Zappa's hotel that

610
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
Is really just about

611
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
The very best customer service

612
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
Zappos

613
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Cable

614
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
TV

615
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
To be great I need that

616
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
We are open to anything where

617
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Service can be a dimension okay so Zappos becomes a

618
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
Huge deal

619
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
And then like

620
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
Entropy

621
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Is what I guess

622
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
In 2009

623
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
You sell to Amazon

624
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Cancel Amazon that actually approached us several years

625
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Before 2009

626
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
Just wanted to

627
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Clara Stanton

628
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
And basically

629
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
Becoming Thane acquired ends up joining the mothership band

630
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
Cannabis it's it's

631
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
Original identity and so we set

632
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
No

633
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Very quickly

634
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
And then they actually in the ears and

635
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Denon 2009

636
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
They launched a competitor called

637
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Endless

638
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
And

639
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Was basically

640
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Lunch

641
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
From our prospective

642
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
Be with us in ultimately

643
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
They weren't going to

644
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Be able to class then

645
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Watch essentially

646
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
D&M and when

647
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,808
And so they try that for a while but

648
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
We continue to grow and so

649
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
I think after several years of

650
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Them

651
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
I'm assuming I don't know

652
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Details

653
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,328
Losing lots of money trying to gain market share through endless

654
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
They are precious again and said

655
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Okay we

656
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
Well let you guys be your own separate

657
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,336
Subsidiary with your own separate culture in own separate way of doing business in

658
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Happy report

659
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
7 years later they free Maine

660
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
Totally true their word and

661
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
We've been able to continue

662
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
Our own thing in our cultures

663
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Very different

664
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Interesting from

665
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
Amazon's in

666
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
And so from our point of view it was really

667
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Just asked if we swapped out our prior board of directors with the new one

668
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
You are so young

669
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
I'm going to eat you still in your early 40s

670
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Anytime so much

671
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
So where do you see yourself in like

672
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
20 year or 30 year term

673
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Are you

674
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
Still running Zappos are you

675
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Are you doing something else

676
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
You know cuz if you ask me

677
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,904
20 years ago means apus wasn't around but I would imagine

678
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
It's only going to be there

679
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
This

680
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
So I don't know I mean I generally don't

681
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Try to think that far ahead

682
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
I guess for me it's just making sure that

683
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,496
I'm doing what makes me happy and

684
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
So many people are

685
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Unhappy

686
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Ladders jobs

687
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
For various reasons I could be

688
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Target Celtic culture

689
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,344
Lack of autonomy all those things are

690
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,136
We want to

691
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,464
Hopefully show that there's a different and better way of

692
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
And I just work but I just think of his ass lights

693
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
And

694
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
And help spread that I guess

695
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
When we were kids that show lifestyles

696
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Yeah and like

697
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
You became a very rich

698
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
A famous person right

699
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
Change the way you live your life

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
I mean right now I live in an Airstream which

701
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
A trailer like a fire

702
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
50 square feet

703
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Everything

704
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Yeah

705
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,440
We've got dogs running around kids running around myself to alpacas

706
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
I and I just love it cuz

707
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
There's just so many

708
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
Random

709
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
Amazing things that happened around the campfire now you just

710
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,520
Go outside and I actually think of it as the world's largest living room

711
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
And I guess for me I've always

712
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Like I'm going to

713
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
Pay for experiences but not really for

714
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Things

715
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Just because

716
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Experiences

717
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
I think I realized

718
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Homologous

719
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Make me happy in

720
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
It's funny cuz I was

721
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Weather this morning

722
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
I having coffee with a

723
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Friend of mine in an Airstream in

724
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
We were talking about

725
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
I think was a quiz or something

726
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Where the question was

727
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
If you

728
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
If your house was on fire and you could only save one thing

729
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
Anyhow what would it be and how that way

730
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Be a really good way of

731
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Getting to know someone and

732
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
I was just looking around my room streaming

733
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
IPhone Maybe

734
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
And

735
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
People ask me what

736
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
My definition of success is in

737
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
I would say

738
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
For me it's

739
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Getting the point where you're truly okay with losing everything you have

740
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,824
Tony hsieh still runs Zappos

741
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,176
It's by forcing himself to do something uncomfortable every single day

742
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
And the date we spoke with him

743
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
He decided to dye his hair red

744
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
And Spike it up into a mohawk

745
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168

00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
We often just

760
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
Expect people to be kind

761
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,168
We think I know you're a good kid you're going to be kind the evidence shows kindness

762
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Is it a skill

763
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
When it takes practice

764
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,568
Find life gets new guide on how to raise an awesome kind kid

765
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Apple podcasts

766
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
Word npr.org

767
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
Hey thanks so much for sticking around

768
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Because it's time now for how you built that

769
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
And today were updating a story we first ran

770
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,928
About a year ago and this one starts

771
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Back in 2015

772
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
When Mike boulos was working as a lawyer

773
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Chicago

774
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,912
And move to a new firm in the new office my new desk was just

775
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
One of those typical dances kind of mounted to a wall

776
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
But yet in downtown Chicago

777
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,616
Is beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows out to my right overlooking the city

778
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
All have floor-to-ceiling Windows in our office

779
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,320
Can relate to the main problem right it office desk that is not in the right place

780
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
The perfect place to be would be the window

781
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Get this beautiful view get the natural sunlight I'm like there's got to be something out there for that Mike was looking for

782
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
Wedge really

783
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
Fit to be mounted

784
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
Directly to a window

785
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
Started looking online couldn't find anything and that's when kind of like I always like to do

786
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
How did the Home Depot in Amazon and started to buy the parts I need to build it okay so first thing on Mike's list

787
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
Suction cups that could attach a desk to a window

788
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
Portwood on the desk but laptop

789
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
Books and stuff

790
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
So I shot then I found some good suction cups that you know held about 40 lb they said mount

791
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
Wanted them with some string that I bought from Amazon and

792
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
Critters really rudimentary almost kind of

793
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Cat bed looking thing

794
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,544
It wasn't too bad for a first try but it was bouncy and it

795
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
Was too narrow to really work as a desk

796
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,688
And it was at that point that I stepped up and I found the

797
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,064
Types of suction disk that they use to install commercial grade glass windows in high-rise

798
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Sounds like this is perfect

799
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
These are

800
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,952
Ultra durable ultra-strong and intended for this purpose essentially

801
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,328
Okay so Mike now had the critical section he needed to affix the desk to a window

802
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
And from there

803
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,168
He built 18 prototypes and finally

804
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
He had the desk you been dreaming of

805
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
People started walking by my office

806
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,080
What is that I want that in my office.

807
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
School where did you buy it

808
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
And that's what kind of lightbulb quick and I was like well I should really think about mass production and really bringing this to Market

809
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,368
And around that time Mike went to a party where you met a guy named Jason then

810
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Tell Jason about the desk eBay

811
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Immediately the light bulb went off in my head

812
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,584
Yes more light bulbs it turns out Jason grohowski was a real estate advisor

813
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,680
It was his job to help businesses improve the design of their workplaces

814
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
Pencil in the desk that Mike has invented

815
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Here's Jason

816
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,688
I've seen how culture within spaces is changing how all the new buildings are glass how

817
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
Everything is about bringing in the natural light for employees and just productivity and health and wellness within spaces

818
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
And so I just got super excited other we need to we need to do this

819
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
Are we to take us to the next level

820
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,584
Mike and Jason soon started working with a design firm in Chicago

821
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
It made even more tweaks to the desk

822
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
And by January 2017 they had a prototype ready so they launch the kickstarter that April

823
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,872
And made $25,000 in just the first day

824
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,456
After we close out the kickstarter we had to fulfill these orders

825
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
So then it was

826
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,600
Let's go get this made they had all of these orders and no manufacturer yet

827
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
Show a month later this is May of 2017

828
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
They found one in Singapore and by November

829
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
Chase and Mike went there to check on the desks

830
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Before they got shipped

831
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,680
I look at the unit unlike something doesn't seem right

832
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
And I play with it

833
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
And the lever snap

834
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,128
At that point we had 2,000 units already made all the components made

835
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,480
And we're like this is something that we can't let out the door

836
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,832
So after a month of sleepless nights and many design revisions

837
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Jason and Mike finally got the Liebherr right

838
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,792
In December they started shipping their desks from their Singapore manufacturer to their customers and more than

839
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
40 countries

840
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,912
They're not both working full-time on the company is called spu

841
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
And their death comes

842
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,568
Fully assembled so you can install it on your window in just a few minutes and then

843
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
Enjoy The View

844
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
Refocus

845
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
So

846
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,480
Closely on our computers all of our work day is

847
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
Just streaming our eyes to look at close objects

848
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:33,184
With dust you you're actually allowing yourself to relax your eye and look out further

849
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,000
And since we last spoke to Jason and Mike

850
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
They got a TV show called Shark Tank

851
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
Three episode are just a few weeks ago

852
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,216
They landed a $150,000 investment

853
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
From one of the sharks

854
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,824
Hoping to launch two more products later this year

855
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,944
But still to this day if you email a company with a customer service question

856
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
