Andreessen Horowitz

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,336
And they were they were like good luck

37
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,736
From NPR how I built this

38
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists the stories behind the movement

39
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
Butterfield perfected the art of the pivot by turning a failed online game come

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,288
Messaging program now valued at over 5

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Billion dollars

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Remember story we did a while back

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
About Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
When they join forces to build a tech

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
They came up with something they called bourbon

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
It was a

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Check-in app

48
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
That was going to take the World by storm

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Take out your smartphone and declare hey I'm on Bourbon

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Starbucks

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Anyone there

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
Problem is there was no one no one use bourbon

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
At least not in the way it was intended

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
Kevin discovered was there small user base

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Really love the photo-sharing

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
That was special

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
Was a failure but

58
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
That cool photo sharing teacher

59
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Well they decided to make that

60
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
Effectiveness

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Is better known today

62
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Is instant

63
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Imagine you're working to build a massive multi

64
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Two player online game

65
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
A weird

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
Utopian fantasy world like

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Burning man but in cyberspace

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
What was that was Stewart Butterfield's big idea this was going to be his life

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Pursued his

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Great achievement

71
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Dwight and bows

72
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
He failed

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
But something else happened

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Two entirely different

75
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Entirely unintended products

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Born from those failures

77
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
First one become Flickr

78
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
It was an early image hosting website where you can

79
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Store in

80
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Photos

81
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
The second one

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
If you work in an office and

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
Pretty sure you've heard of it or use it

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
It's called slack and if you

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Don't know what it is

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
It's a messaging app design 14 collaboration

87
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,040
Black is one of the fastest-growing business apps ever and it was

88
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
Accident

89
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
We'll get to that story

90
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
What you need to know about Stewart Butterfield is that

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
Get kind of an unconventional childhood like

92
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
The grid back-to-the-land unconventional

93
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Because his parents were counterculture hippies

94
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,728
Who decided to live in the remote Backwoods of British Columbia

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592
Yep they had restored an Old Log Cabin that was built

96
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
Around the turn of the last century

97
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
Didn't have running water until I was

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
Read NIV electricity till I was four

99
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Such a funny story of my mother's father

100
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
Who came from Poland to Montreal in between World War 1 and World War II

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Coming to visit them

102
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,303
And they had a bathtub the front yard in the yard just like

103
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Trying to eat

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,679
The food that they were growing and didn't have many possessions and he was black

105
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
I can't believe I

106
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,311
Escapist at all in Poland and send all of you to University

107
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
And then now you're back living in this

108
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
Stump oh my God

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
They look real live off the land

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
My name was Dharma

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Your birth name was Dharma

112
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Yeah that it Hindu and then later Buddhist concept

113
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
The pathway

114
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
And when I was 12 years old

115
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Like most other as we wanted to be normal

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
So

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Stewart

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
For some reason I had the impression that Stuart was the most normal name

119
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
No I regret it now cuz Dharma Butterfield

120
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
Stewart eventually went to study philosophy in college

121
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,295
Wellington School PS I got really interested in computers and on the side he taught himself to code

122
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
HTML

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
He started to make websites for local businesses

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
But his master plan his main goal would actually become a philosophy Professor until he real

125
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Working in Tech

126
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Might be a more stable job

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
Joey move to Vancouver and get a job at a tech startup called

128
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
Communicate. Calm cuz I have found it it had bought in 1990

129
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,711
All of these domains like Vietnam. Common brazil.com

130
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
Makeup.com in perfume

131
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
It was Brian Leo

132
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
It's unfortunately passed away since then

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
But I'm so this is like 98

134
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
99 Vietnam.

135
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Wow yeah but also like

136
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Dance.com intellect

137
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,447
Monica, you get hundreds of them really really valuable that was the guy

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
I didn't even know you could

139
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Goodbye, in 93

140
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Really really early

141
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
What at that time was

142
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
A gold mine

143
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
And the way that we fought back

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
We would

145
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Develop one universal

146
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,231
E-commerce back end and it have all the domain names be the front end and the idea was that they were going to have

147
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
A bunch of websites

148
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Mabel doll

149
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Basically direct users to

150
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,655
This one Ecommerce site where you can get anything makeup or whatever it was

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Oar tickets

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Brazil or

153
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Boxing paraphernalia or whatever the hell

154
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
But

155
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
No one had anything really to

156
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
No one knew exactly what we were doing

157
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,015
It's really early but, it seemed like this was incredibly valuable we're going to have a contest

158
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Give away a BMW Z3 wasn't thinking that James Bond movies was like the hot car that time

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
So that we got people to sign up what are they signing up for I don't know but got divorced and worse and worse like day by day

160
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,471
Because no one knew exactly what they're supposed to be doing it in the management meetings turned into screaming matches

161
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,543
And so around the end of February

162
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,687
The year 2000 I quit I walked away I thought I was walking away from like 10 million dollars in equity

163
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
And I got bought out for

164
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
For $35,000 on my way up

165
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
And of course like

166
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
10 days later two weeks later was the first.com crash

167
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,023
And so in the end I got $35,000 more than I would have had I stayed out

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
What did you decide to do next

169
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Convinced one of

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
But I do happen to sit next to me

171
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,847
Jason Clausen who was running a website on the side called grad finder who does that

172
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
102 classmates of this is how many years before

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,783
Facebook accepted then I convinced them to leave and I had my $35,000 in

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,927
We went down and raise the whole $50,000 money from other people and started it up to the real business

175
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,535
Yeah it is a way to find other people graduate from your college basically

176
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Directory of high school race in each high school you can have a graduation year and people just sign up and

177
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
Message each other stuff like that

178
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
We worked on it for me

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
XXR 8 months and it got acquired

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
The dot-coms that had raised

181
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Planet Money

182
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
$159

183
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
Gospel to the end of the year 2000

184
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
And

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
They not going bankrupt

186
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
A year later

187
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
So when you guys sold

188
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Gray finder with

189
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Acquired

190
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Did you walk away with a bunch of cash yourself

191
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Yeah I'm in a bunch of cash

192
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Morton's

193
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
See what it was but it wasn't like

194
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Millions

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
It was it was

196
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
December cash4you no gyno

197
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
The twenties

198
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
Yeah you know I took a lot of the next

199
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Year off that did Consulting work but relatively low

200
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
What's wrong this time like 2,000 where you

201
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Met someone didn't you got married

202
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
I did

203
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
In like 99

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
I started a web log

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,215
And there was a couple hundred people or so around the world who had blogs and we all knew each other

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,335
And one of the bloggers whose blogs I admired was a woman named Caterina fake

207
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,175
Call Katerina. Net and it still exists now 20

208
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Plus years later

209
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
So

210
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
Around that time

211
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
We met

212
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
And

213
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
A year-and-a-half later

214
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
We got married

215
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
And

216
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
The.com era hype

217
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
And completely dissipated a lot of companies have

218
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Imploded

219
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
But there's a lot of creativity in late 99

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
I started the competition called

221
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
The 5K which was to build the smallest

222
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Are there any website or web page that

223
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Be done in 5 kilobytes of data

224
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
And one of the people who entered the

225
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Competition was

226
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Mary Costello who lived

227
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
In time in St Louis

228
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
And

229
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Spark up a friendship with him

230
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
And

231
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
But it's time Jason had come back

232
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
From

233
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
The grad finder acquisition and we all started working together on a project called game NeverEnding which was in

234
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
Contemptible the web-based

235
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Massively multiplayer game

236
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
And it was a never-ending game presumably

237
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Yep

238
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
This was

239
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
You and Katerina at your now wife

240
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
And

241
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Jason Clausen who

242
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Will you describe find

243
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Yep and with this guy Eric Costello

244
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
You decide that you wanted

245
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Create

246
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
A game

247
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
A massive multiplayer online

248
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
Yeah so there's that there's a type of Kami that existed before

249
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
Geographical games to cough

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
And it was a precursor for everything

251
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
World of Warcraft being the example that most people would know

252
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
But we weren't interested in fighting game

253
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
You're interested

254
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
In creativity and play is going to be pre-tax

255
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Social interaction

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
So

257
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
This idea still has a lot of appeal to me it's a

258
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,599
Horrible idea commercial Hank like I said there's not enough people who are interested in it

259
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
But

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
A group

261
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Who

262
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,791
To use the Prototype and we're very enthusiastic in the seeds of this incredible community

263
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,655
And we thought hey we got the Prototype people liked it we can make this into a real

264
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
Project the game

265
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Look like

266
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Would you be in front of screen looking at like

267
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
A Minecraft type interface

268
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
2002-2003 so the graphics weren't riding

269
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Minecraft quality

270
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
There's the different objects in you can click on them to pick them up or

271
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Cooking them to do stuff with them

272
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
I really rooted

273
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
So

274
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
We tried everything

275
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Raise some money for this

276
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
And

277
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
There was Zero

278
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
The middle of 5 mm to

279
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
And

280
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
No one wanted to invest in anything that anything to do with you

281
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
How are you even going to make money off of

282
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
This was a business model

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
People would pay a month

284
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Description

285
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
So

286
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
I put my money into it

287
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
Some of us working on it put our money into it we hired a couple people

288
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,767
We raised a couple hundred thousand dollars a friends-and-family money and when I say friends and family I mean like literally friends and family

289
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
And

290
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
By the middle of 2000

291
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
3 we know we have been working on that year it was clear

292
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
How come flag

293
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Texas was going to be in

294
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Would you like

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
We ready

296
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
And we were desperate for something

297
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Else that time

298
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
That we could complete in a

299
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Shorter man

300
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
And that thing ended up being flicker

301
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
And

302
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
I think when we started at the intention was going to build this

303
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Someone will buy it

304
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
It for like a million dollars

305
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
What happened

306
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
You got this idea

307
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
To build this game very expensive

308
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,287
You just you just don't have enough money to do it right so then you decided

309
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
It needs you to starting up

310
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Flickr

311
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
Would you like a photo sharing even happen

312
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
Well we had

313
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
At the time developed a whole bunch of really into

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
15 +

315
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Relatively novel technology so we had a game that you could

316
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
And despite the fact

317
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
Is pretty rudimentary Graphics it was still

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Protect logic

319
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Totally

320
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Fascinating a new

321
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Yeah and the

322
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Story sounds

323
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Too good to be true and kind of hurt

324
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Ridiculous butt

325
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
A group of lawyers had organized a

326
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Law and virtual worlds in New York

327
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
And invited all the people in end

328
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
And I went

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
With Katarina

330
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
And on the plane on the way there

331
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
I got food

332
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Got to JFK

333
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Throw it up again.

334
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
The taxi pull over on the Van Wyck

335
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,231
The throw up all over the carpet

336
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,071
But I'm really sick I couldn't keep anything down, like fever dreams

337
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
And the part of town

338
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Apocryphal

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
I swear it's true the whole idea for Flickr came to me.

340
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Voted out on leg straps

341
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
The paper in the

342
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
Hotel room while I couldn't sleep 5 in the morning

343
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Will you wrote At what

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
A way to take the interface that we had developed for the game

345
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Black people chat

346
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
Change locations which let people

347
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Manipulate these objects like a

348
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Pull them into their inventory ADF with them

349
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Instead of the

350
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
We'll just have photos

351
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
So you can upload a photo

352
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
And and you could do stuff

353
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Stop I mean

354
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,263
People can draw a little rectangle in the photo and then make an annotation of that part of the photo

355
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
They can chat about them

356
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,895
I could send them to other people that could change the title and everything happened dynamically select

357
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,479
When I get something you would see what was happening on your computer

358
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
So

359
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
Again technologically for the time amazing

360
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Mind blowing people were

361
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Incredibly effusive

362
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Then

363
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Pause

364
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Second to say

365
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
This was the first version of

366
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
How much we quickly changed in the reason we were successful is because you changed it

367
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
And I think a good point

368
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Another character

369
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
I've got so many friends going here but

370
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
So one of the players of the

371
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Was

372
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Like early 20s

373
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Hardcore just nerd

374
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Who let the Tiny Village in England

375
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
And had a job in London he committed to London

376
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
I began to train for a couple of hours

377
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
And

378
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
She had developed a bunch of stuff

379
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,791
To illustrate the social networks inside the game plan if we didn't have any apis for him to use but

380
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
It turned out had hacked into our internal mailing list

381
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
Best when they're working on the game had been reading all of our messages

382
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
He was able to develop

383
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
When he was at like I'm just a person who

384
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Play the game never ending

385
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
And

386
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
His name

387
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Was Cal Henderson

388
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Elvis such a

389
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Geek like one of the nerdiest people I've ever met

390
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
My life is also a

391
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Prodigy

392
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Programmer

393
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
And so when I convinced him to start

394
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
To work with us on making flicker he was

395
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
You really into it and

396
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
On the train to London everyday 2 hours and 2 hours out

397
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
He wrote almost all of the gut

398
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Lots of liquor

399
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
The way to upload the photos

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
Did the process them to store them display them

401
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
The original

402
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
Payment he got with me buying stuff off his Amazon wish list

403
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
So is like

404
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Radiohead

405
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Yuki's Alchemy of rare vinyl

406
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Everyone's like focused on the

407
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
This game

408
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
The money's running out

409
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
How did you then convince everybody to

410
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
To Pivot

411
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Did you say hey guys you know what let's just

412
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
Dump this gaming thing let's go all-in on a

413
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Photo sharing

414
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Did anybody say

415
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
What are you talking about

416
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Oh yeah so I actually forgot about the

417
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Couple years ago

418
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
I want has reminded of it

419
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
I could have laid out

420
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
And said the situation

421
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Finish the game

422
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
I let everyone vote

423
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
You said to them you let them vote on whether it actually go through

424
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
Yeah whether to switch our efforts to

425
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
The flickering to really pursue that

426
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Instead of the game

427
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
And then I lost

428
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Why did you even think that was a good idea

429
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
Because it was something that we could complete

430
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Actually get it

431
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Out

432
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
Eric was the one person on the team who had kids so he's the one person who

433
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
We just weren't able to pay anyone

434
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Yeah

435
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
So we had this phone I lost

436
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Flickr lost in game 1

437
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
So they had to call Eric on the side

438
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Doosan

439
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
What I imagine happens in the Senate to Penelec horse-trading

440
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
To convince him to change his vote

441
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
And I worked and

442
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,239
Decision was December 2003 and in February 2004

443
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
We watch foot

444
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
I'll put a San Diego

445
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
This conference

446
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Super excited about when you launched

447
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
It was a pretty big deal when it launched him in that

448
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
Clovis community

449
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
Play Decade before the majority people got smartphones

450
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
Internet wasn't still perceived as a

451
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,535
It's kind of like weird creepy place like

452
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
If you saw the popular image of an

453
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Internet user

454
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,471
It'll be like a really overweight guy and against man Simpsons

455
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Exactly

456
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Yeah

457
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
So you guys so it's like 2004

458
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
You put flicker out there and end

459
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
People who were on the internet

460
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
We're like cool

461
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Place to

462
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
To put our photos up online

463
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Yeah

464
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
So around that time

465
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Google had bought blocker

466
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
How much is a little early blogging Pro

467
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Programs

468
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,815
And they didn't have a way to host photos so they put

469
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
You know in there

470
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Help materials

471
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Online

472
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
How do I upload photos to use Flickr

473
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
You know it was like the one

474
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Standout event

475
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,615
Time where the the world that kind of soured on the internet

476
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Rose from the

477
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
The ashes of all

478
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Destruction and became like a

479
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,319
A cool interesting thing that people can get involved in that was

480
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
In-N-Out hours

481
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
Flickr going to make money

482
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
Because all these people are coming onto it presumably good to buy like

483
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,327
Like server space which is a lot more expensive than before like

484
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Cloud computing

485
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,911
How old how how did you do with it

486
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
We saw what we called Pro account

487
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Which let you

488
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
I believe it was

489
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
You could see the whole history

490
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
If your photos were as if you didn't

491
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
Bipro cat you can only see 200 and

492
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
And

493
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Better she went pretty well but you're right

494
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
The hardware that timer

495
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Astronaut

496
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,695
These people's photos

497
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
Absolutely wenzhou every week we would

498
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Put an order

499
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Adele

500
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
UPS will deliver boxes from Dell and then every Friday night

501
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
I said I would go down to the

502
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
Where the servers wear and screwdriver

503
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
Put servers on to the RAC Center

504
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Hurricane Ivan

505
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
But because the car was really taking off

506
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
So we we actually raise a little bit

507
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Able to buy this

508
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Growing releaf

509
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
People buying Pro account

510
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,023
You're not very many but we also didn't pay ourselves very much so we're covering the cost

511
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
True

512
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Backhoe usage

513
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
And suddenly

514
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Companies

515
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
I want to buy a

516
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Like like

517
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Which companies

518
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
We were talking to

519
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
Google Yahoo to

520
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
If I scored another six months or so now it's

521
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Christmas

522
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
2004 that's about to turn into

523
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
2005

524
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
And we also had a bunch of venture capitalist

525
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
At the same time Yahoo is getting really really serious

526
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Search part of Yahoo

527
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Make an offer to buy us

528
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
And then over that

529
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
Christmas New Years. 2004-2005 where to choose

530
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Do I take this money from the investors

531
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Can build this into something bigger

532
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,455
Or do we want to take the money now from Yahoo

533
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
And we got a great catch from them

534
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
And the promise was you

535
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,440
Come work at Yahoo by the company will get this money but we also give you all of these resources we have all of Yahoo's

536
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
Hundreds of millions of users and Oliver

537
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
Technology our servers and you can go listen to the

538
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Is great and wonder

539
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
What were they offer

540
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Who's around 20 mi

541
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
229 bucks wow you are

542
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
You are Rick guide overnight

543
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
So suddenly all the friends and family to invest in

544
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Dumb game

545
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Couple years prior

546
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
We're in a good position and everyone who work there it would

547
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Deferred salary

548
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Sacrificed along the way

549
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
What's in a good position

550
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
And

551
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Hey look

552
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,400
You know this is Olivia a life-changing amount of money you'll be able to do what you want to do after

553
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
And who knows if this opportunity will stay wrapped

554
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
So you should just take the acquisition so smart move

555
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,848
Smart move for sure 100% of the time they would give you opposite

556
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,688
Singular thing

557
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
I'm in the internet

558
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
You guys you and Karen work till I kind of internet and after that acquisition

559
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
You landed on the cover of Newsweek

560
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Yeah so I would say still a little bit internet

561
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
I was in New York

562
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Fly back to the

563
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Music

564
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
Issue came out

565
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Well I'll tell you

566
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
I grabbed a stack of them at the newsstand inside of JFK

567
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Spanish slapping down

568
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
And the woman who is checking me out

569
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,552
But you got to look up and she scanned why magazine and she flipped it over and scan the other one that she said

570
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
Honey you know all these are the same

571
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Yep

572
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Heaven

573
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
She looked up at me

574
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
MSU left out of the magazine she looked up at me again and she was

575
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Really

576
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Your eyes lit up shoes

577
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
So excited and then she read the cover of it

578
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
It said something like

579
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Web 2.0

580
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Open Flickr to Myspace

581
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Something something

582
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,544
And she was just crestfallen Jesus like oh my God

583
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
I thought you're going to be someone

584
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,176
Important like your in a movie star or American Idol contestant

585
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,296
Or something like I cared about was like some Web 2.0

586
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,624
Amazing and she just scan the rest of magazines and check me out and that was it

587
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Uso Yahoo

588
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,232
Pretty good deal now that we know now.

589
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
Honest this product

590
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
You walk away with

591
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Probably good amount of cash probably not set for life

592
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Spell right

593
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
Do not save her life and part of that

594
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Apposition

595
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
What color now

596
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Tell

597
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,384
It's conditional on the employees staying with Yahoo for a Time

598
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
How long did you to stay with Yahoo.

599
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Flea bass

600
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Scallion

601
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
3 years

602
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Neulasta

603
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Said how long

604
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
3 + 1/2

605
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
So you like it you babe are basically you made it

606
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
So how are those three years ago

607
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
I think

608
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
I would never in the arm

609
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
I'm 8 but I look back at that

610
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,984
I'm the way I would imagine some people look back at boot camp which was it was horrible at the time but like very real

611
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Overworking the new machine and I learned a lot

612
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Developed character

613
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
What was horrible about her

614
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
The timer has 9 people

615
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
So

616
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,880
9 people being acquired by what at the time it was like an eleven or twelve thousand person company

617
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
And suddenly everything that was just

618
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Easy like we were just

619
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
Decide something and then it would be decided became this Mass

620
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
The process

621
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,168
Now we wanted to get more servers we had to go to the hardware Review Committee and you had to make an

622
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
You can get an appointment for like 5 weeks

623
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Meanwhile

624
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
II fall over

625
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
And when we wanted to

626
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Blogs

627
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
Something you know like making an ounce of public are at a future we would just do it

628
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,784
Before we required to you

629
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
It took a lot of getting used to

630
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Almost all the energy things other than making

631
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
King's Liquor

632
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
It sounds like you

633
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,400
Do you really want to get out

634
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,984
I used to do cat mythology in the deliberate way I learned

635
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Amazing amount

636
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,336
Some of it was negative lessons like me or don't do this

637
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,200
It's just really eye-opening

638
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
Certainly I learned a lot more than I ever would have learned many MBA program

639
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
Two pretty high-profile that access to all of the executives

640
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,840
She only decision that is involved in all these things I never would have been involved in otherwise

641
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
So when you left

642
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
Yahoo was it

643
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,776
Was it with a feeling of joy and possibility or was it a feeling of like

644
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Okay

645
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
I don't know what I would do that

646
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
I thought you halfway between there was it wasn't

647
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
Overwhelmingly positive or

648
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
Cuz you I guess and this is the kind of personal thing but you

649
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Your marriage is breaking up

650
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Yep it was

651
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
We

652
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
I had only recently had a kid

653
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
And

654
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
We didn't work together that closely I Yahoo

655
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
But

656
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
It's some

657
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Free challenging to

658
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,056
To work with your spouse especially the early days of a startup

659
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
When we first started working reflector like out of money

660
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
And such as the business's

661
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Armani

662
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
We're out of money

663
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
And that that stress isn't like okay I can leave it at the office and go home to my family which is totally dependent

664
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
The other really

665
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Interwoven

666
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
It was a difficult time and

667
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
By the time that we left

668
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
Yahoo like a pretty soon after that it was just

669
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
I guess you

670
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
You still have to work yourself to figure something out to

671
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
What did you do when when you walk

672
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
Avi what was your plan

673
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,432
There wasn't an immediate short-term planners Atlanta

674
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Take some time off is that it

675
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Benadryl whirlwinds

676
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
But it didn't take long

677
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
4

678
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,392
A lot of those same people who worked on Flickr and had worked on the previous game

679
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
Do you decide that we wanted to work on the game again

680
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
I'm going to go back to gaming

681
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Yeah you didn't learn your lesson

682
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
The first time around

683
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah we apparently didn't even so the world look pretty different

684
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
Beginning of 2009

685
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
There was at least an order Maddie

686
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Attitude more

687
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
People online Verizon 2002 the majority of people

688
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,176
Didn't have internet access at home now the majority did

689
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Computers are Wayfair

690
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,504
Pastor all the hardware was way cheaper

691
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296
Online games

692
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Where some really popular

693
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Cat fail

694
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Like yeah

695
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
All of the conditions are

696
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
So we should do

697
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
When you say when you say

698
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
People who worked on the previous game with you all those guys

699
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,704
Yes it was me and three of the engineers including

700
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Kyle Anderson

701
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Another one

702
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Next Ricky Martin

703
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
It in Vancouver

704
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
And what we

705
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
Glitch

706
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Was completely different

707
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Glitch

708
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
Yes so in this game

709
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
It was a

710
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,184
Bizarre Fantastical world really

711
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,280
Try to encourage individual creativity and people can create stuff inside the world

712
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
But in the world.

713
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
Like milk butterflies and in order to

714
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
Butterfly milk and you could

715
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,496
Like eggs grow on trees and the look was kind of like

716
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,384
Dr. Seuss meets Monty Python meets like modern-day graphic novels

717
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
As you move around the world

718
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
It does look changed

719
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Automatically

720
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
So you had a track record

721
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,856
Flickered like you already had reputations been on the cover of Newsweek youthworks

722
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Yahoo

723
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
So when it came time to raise money

724
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Was it pretty easy

725
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah absolutely

726
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
It was very easy

727
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Started off with a

728
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,632
I can be a million-and-a-half dollars

729
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
Scramble to hire someone we were able to afford all the technology we wanted

730
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,080
And as we started developing the game we had a bunch of really positive early

731
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
The indications

732
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
Stop charge you money and they were

733
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Vacate a lot

734
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,272
The average person who paid was paying $70 a year

735
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
And this is like what 2010-2011 some like that

736
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Yeah

737
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
And people are already paying for it was that good

738
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
Well is that good for a very small population

739
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,816
So in fact it was really hard for us to get people even to

740
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,424
Go to the first few minutes of the game because he was just so different and so weird

741
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Most people have tried it weird

742
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
Like what the hell is this

743
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Peaced out in the first

744
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
3 minutes ago

745
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,384
Alright so you guys launches things

746
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Early success to raise

747
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Lots of cash

748
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
And then November of

749
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
2012

750
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
You shut it down what what happened

751
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Well

752
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
Been in business

753
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,488
Thickest occupancy of requires a lot of

754
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
Unnatural optimism

755
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
At some point

756
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
It's just that optimism is exhausting

757
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
We have

758
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Called a leaky bucket

759
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
People would come in

760
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Top of the funnel

761
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
And the funnel is going to

762
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Describing Mike

763
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,688
First people hear about your thing then they go to the website then they sign up

764
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,808
Then they end up in our case play the game a little bit then they end up hating you on each of those stages

765
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Some people fall out of the process of

766
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
I called the funnel

767
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
The Leaky bucket did you get people in the top

768
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Next Fallout

769
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Follow the process

770
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,816
Too early not enough of them make it all the way

771
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
And

772
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
Next game dynamically added

773
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
The next bit of customization

774
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,872
The next the next thing the next thing that I send

775
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
But I think continue to try those things

776
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
We just never

777
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,296
Found that magic formula that would

778
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Make it work

779
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Economical

780
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
It would have been

781
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Define

782
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
People call lifestyle business

783
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
But it was never going to become the kind of business

784
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
That would justify

785
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
By 17 and 1/2 million dollars venture capital

786
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
At what point did you come to the decision to shut it down

787
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Well so I was

788
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
I was losing a lot of snow

789
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
I was up really late one night

790
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
And I dislike

791
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
2 or 3 in the morning

792
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Sinbad my

793
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,248
Haven't been sleeping for hours but I just realized

794
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
I don't believe that

795
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
I don't believe it

796
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
I realized

797
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Right in that moment

798
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
There's a saying

799
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,744
If you're thinking about firing someone

800
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
A lot

801
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
You should just fire

802
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
Meaning that like that intuition

803
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
The cat keeps coming up

804
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
It's almost certainly correct and you wouldn't be thinking that all

805
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
All the time if there was a real

806
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
Shot at making a relationship work

807
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Exactly the same thing with a

808
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
Business once I begin

809
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Not have little doubt

810
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
A fundamental level

811
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
I was just like I don't think this is going to work

812
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
First thing that morning

813
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,696
I wrote to all the co-founders and then to our board of directors and just sad

814
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
It's over

815
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
And

816
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
That definitely was not at yunnan

817
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Contention in an argument

818
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Enormous amount of time

819
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Millions of frames

820
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Animation

821
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,640
Hundreds of hours of original music

822
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
So how did you break the news to

823
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
I mean they must have been

824
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Excruciating

825
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah it was it was horrible

826
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
I say we can have an all-hands meeting

827
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
And everyone

828
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
You have files in a get-together people have

829
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
Coffee in the morning and a chit-chatting and

830
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
And finally like

831
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
I stand up

832
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
And the meeting starts

833
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
And

834
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
I start

835
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,776
Tell them that we're going to check out the game and before I could even get

836
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
First half of the sentence out I was

837
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
Almost everyone

838
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
My personally convinced

839
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
They should come work

840
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
It's company that they should

841
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,064
Except are stock options and they should believe in the project that they should believe in me

842
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,440
Humiliating is a real sense that I had failed all these people

843
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
I had an obligation to them

844
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,304
And I was Hadlock die as well

845
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328

895

November of 2012

896
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
Stewart Butterfield decided to shut down development

897
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Is multiplayer online game

898
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Any laid off almost

899
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
All of the employees

900
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
Are the time to really get to know what his next move was going to be but

901
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
He decided to do something

902
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
Kind of unusual

903
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Which is the

904
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
How about the people he just fired

905
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
This is where

906
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Ico

907
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,456
Why do we make the decision when we did because we still get raise all this money we still

908
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
Over 5 million dollars in the bank

909
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:39,648
It was late in the year when you're going to get T-Pain everyone for several months if they had a chance to find another job

910
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,512
We built a website called higher genius in everyone's life

911
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,912
Portfolio their name and endorsements we wrote reference letters we help people with the resumes we made introductions

912
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Processed meat

913
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Every single person who

914
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Work there who's getting laid off and there is up

915
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
Like 37 of them I believe

916
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,480
Every single one of them got another job and in most cases they got a better job than the one

917
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Bad

918
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
And I think making sure I got hired generated in enormous amount of Goodwill like in the community at large and

919
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
I think it was very helpful for us down the road

920
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,792
When we started talking more willing to give us a chance

921
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
Okay see you were left at the helm of this

922
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Now

923
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Rump of a

924
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,472
Company or non company and what

925
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
What was your next move

926
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Well so

927
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
The interesting about

928
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
Klitch was while it wasn't successful as a

929
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
We were at

930
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Extraordinary Libra.

931
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
And

932
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
There was a system for internal communication that we had to

933
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
That we didn't

934
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
I think about as a thing

935
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,952
What you didn't have a name we never talked about it it was just how we happened to communicate

936
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
And was all built around the

937
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Weather Channel

938
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
And you got a channel

939
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Creative writing

940
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
A project for a

941
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Functional group

942
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
4

943
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Atopica

944
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Conversation

945
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
And a channel exists whether you remember or not

946
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
And it can continue to exist

947
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
After you leave

948
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
It's kind of an inversion of

949
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
The typical

950
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
Interoffice communication which is entirely based on email

951
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
An email

952
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
If you join a company

953
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
That has been around for

954
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,600
Thirty years that have been using email since

955
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Inception

956
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
You got an empty inbox

957
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Are completely cut off from the

958
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
History of what's happened before you got there

959
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
And almost all of them

960
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Like 99.99

961
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
10% of it

962
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Is going

963
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,936
Into individuals

964
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Inbox

965
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Is not visible

966
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Anyone else

967
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,104
And you can be cc'd into something that was already going on or someone can forward you a conversation

968
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
But it's not accessible

969
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Someone else has to give it to you

970
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Whereas while we're working on the game glitch

971
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
We would hire someone new and

972
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
And they would have

973
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
The whole history of

974
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
All of the conversations

975
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
The customer support team it had before they got there

976
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
Do we have a whole history of

977
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
The topics of the designers are working on

978
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Everything else that was going on was visible

979
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
My Samsung is that like

980
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:05,056
You weren't seeing ongoing intro chat system Revolution I like you were focused on

981
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,128
Glitch in this thing was kind of cool and it just made things kind of

982
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
Grease the skids

983
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,968
Am I Wrong were you did you actually wake up in the morning

984
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Like everyday and say oh my God this thing is amazing

985
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
No I didn't you were right

986
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
We didn't even think about it I think it's someone asked me what do you do for intelligent I would have Shrugged my shoulders. I don't know if that's whatever

987
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
We didn't think about it at all and it was only

988
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,608
Once we had decided to shut down the game

989
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
That we realized I pay this

990
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Systems actually pretty good

991
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
We would never work without assistance

992
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
It's so much better than before

993
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
Maybe other people would like

994
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
You decide

995
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Let's see if we can't

996
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,320
Take this like Chat thing we bills and turn that into a business

997
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
We have these conversations and we have them in our internal

998
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
Indications that predated soccer

999
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
Pinterest timestamp

1000
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,912
Memory is very different than the reality of my memory is it is it took us months to decide

1001
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
In fact it took us like less than a week

1002
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
The core was there like almost instantly

1003
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,896
And so who is left to who how many people

1004
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
State two

1005
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
See if you can make this new thing work

1006
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
So it was

1007
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Myself

1008
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,344
And the other three co-founders of those four of us

1009
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
Emitters for employees of a cat

1010
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,768
One of him we had work with back in the clicker days is a back-end programmer

1011
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,120
IOS mobile engineer are head of QA and one designer

1012
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,240
So you decide hey let's see if we can take this this side thing that we've built

1013
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
And see if we can turn that into our business

1014
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Where they passionate about the

1015
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
Interesting to make a game of video

1016
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Navigation tool

1017
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,112
I think we were

1018
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
Go to the trauma with

1019
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
A group of people and you really get

1020
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
Bound to them

1021
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Makes you very close

1022
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
I think we all wanted

1023
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
Working together

1024
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Work with many more of the people that

1025
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Wake me up in have the opportunity to

1026
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Keep

1027
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
Do happy stories being a pirate

1028
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
Quite a few of the people who worked on the game

1029
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
Including that one software engineer I mentioned to

1030
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
I just convinced to move on Hangout he's been

1031
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Earliest I can play for a long time

1032
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,600
They might sound completely different no one's enterprise software that has all this Fortune 100

1033
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Customers

1034
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
Online game

1035
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Batumi

1036
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Fundamentalism

1037
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
When is I just like making

1038
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
And I like doing it with the other people they all like

1039
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Making software as well

1040
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
And then on the other hand

1041
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Whereas

1042
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
There were two massively multiplayer games and there's a massively multiplayer photo-sharing

1043
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
Slack is most massively multiplayer Communications Network

1044
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
So what did you tell your investors did you just like say

1045
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,320
Hey you know we're just going to Shafter we're no longer going to do games that we're going to focus on this communication tool

1046
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Is that what you said

1047
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Yeah that's pretty much it and

1048
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
You none of them wanted their money

1049
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
And

1050
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
For altruistic reasons but we already spent

1051
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Their options were

1052
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
Like we can get back

1053
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Or

1054
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
Taken by one more Lottery

1055
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
And say

1056
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
Keep the money

1057
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
We'll keep our ownership in a company and see what you can do

1058
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
Yeah little white movie

1059
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
You have the best decision

1060
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Any of them had ever made

1061
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
Alright so you

1062
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
So at this

1063
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
Point at the end of 2012

1064
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
What's Slack

1065
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,624
Scarlet Slack

1066
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Internal Communications

1067
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,536
Yeah I was really wedded to the name and it was not really popular

1068
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
Internally

1069
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
And

1070
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
They're going to be a regular English word

1071
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Wanted people to be able to

1072
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Ballot if we set it

1073
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,592
We had to be able to get the trademark and have a look at the Domain

1074
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
Pick a negative connotation

1075
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,943
Slacker

1076
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
You're slacking off

1077
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Pick up the slack with

1078
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,879
Cut me some slack and I think that the negative connotations I felt like

1079
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
Because it would beat this would be an

1080
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
Did an unusual name it would

1081
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
Be more likely to stick with people

1082
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
He said that we spent

1083
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
The next four months

1084
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
Arguing about different names like dozens of different names

1085
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
Put all of them in the end either ran into like we couldn't get the trademark or

1086
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
We can get the domain name

1087
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
And Slack

1088
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,383
Speaking of.com

1089
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,967
Registrations was registered by this guy in 1993 lives in

1090
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,015
Somewhere in Wisconsin

1091
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:35,647
Who is an electrical engineer and there's no more iconic internet thing this

1092
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
He had his website with pictures of it

1093
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:47,423
Slack.com you can go into the archives website with a domain name

1094
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
So when you when you pivot

1095
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,079
From glitched

1096
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
To Slack

1097
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
If the end of 2012 or later

1098
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,223
Was it fully formed was it was it essentially

1099
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Ready to go

1100
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,343
No there's two things that one was the internal Communications

1101
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
That was

1102
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Just really trailer

1103
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
But what was

1104
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
As a blueprint for what we were

1105
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,279
Wanted to build it was more like perfect

1106
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
We had that

1107
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
We started developing

1108
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Completely from scratch

1109
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Dial

1110
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,703
December 2012 January 2013

1111
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,031
Couple months later we had enough done that we could start using it

1112
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,847
Couple months after that we had enough done that we could invite some

1113
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
Two friends to try it and then suddenly realized

1114
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Here's a challenge

1115
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
We have been working like this

1116
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Perfectly

1117
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Natural frosting

1118
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Advantages of

1119
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
We're just obvious

1120
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Articulate

1121
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
And we tried to convince her

1122
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Our friends and other

1123
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Companies that use at Neverland

1124
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
Like why would we do that

1125
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
Exactly

1126
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
And the

1127
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
Really hard part of

1128
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Unlike most

1129
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
Software that you can't unilaterally.

1130
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Decide to use

1131
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
With your colleagues

1132
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,311
Everyone has to buy it

1133
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
Yeah I can't send you a message unless you're also using it

1134
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
So it has a real

1135
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Challenge

1136
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
At the beginning

1137
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Especially when no one's heard of

1138
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
No one knows anyone else who uses any

1139
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
It's brand new software from this flaky company that just

1140
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,535
Failed make it when massively multiplayer game so who knows how long they're going to be doing this why am I going to trust them

1141
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
And

1142
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,119
What we imagine would be really easy sell

1143
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
How can we go and say

1144
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Hey just try this

1145
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
Great work amazing for us

1146
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
Was just received

1147
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
The cold stares

1148
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
By 6

1149
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
7 * it would show them demo ism

1150
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
Try to explain

1151
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
It was great

1152
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
We got much better at 10

1153
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Refining the pay

1154
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Catching explaining what the value of everything was

1155
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
Can you save this to me in mm

1156
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
13

1157
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
I've got emails coming in

1158
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Phone calls

1159
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Text

1160
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Like Facebook

1161
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,839
I don't need this other thing is this just going to be another time suck

1162
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
And then you say

1163
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
And then I would say

1164
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
This will be like

1165
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Huge bun

1166
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
Consolidate all the communication to tapping all these other channels

1167
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
In critically ill build Hazard KY

1168
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
The archive increases in value over

1169
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,687
It's about the longer you use it the more you get out of it

1170
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
You can find

1171
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
The answers to questions

1172
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,575
The people that had before it says resources shared across everyone

1173
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,207
It's been a lot less energy and of course you would have Jack again and I went to

1174
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Yes I will go back and forth with

1175
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
This rollout there's like

1176
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
The first

1177
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,447
Three or four external teams using it took us forever and then finally we convinced them

1178
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
Comedy radio

1179
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
To try

1180
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
100

1181
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Funny people

1182
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Are you guys were at this point how many

1183
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Still the same

1184
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
Working like

1185
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:45,343
Yeah okay this is actually

1186
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Probably from the

1187
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,511
Practice

1188
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
We were sure that this was going to be

1189
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,911
What's funny is we went back to our investors including Andreessen

1190
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,495
Which is now like a really big successful Venture Capital firm

1191
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
And group had a lot of experience

1192
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,383
Enterprise software company

1193
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
We went in there and told them

1194
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Andantino

1195
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Are Grand ambition

1196
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Which was

1197
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
Hey we believe that there's

1198
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,951
You know we can one day get to a hundred million dollars in Revenue with this business and thereby be a billion dollar business

1199
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
And

1200
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
Just like you guys have no idea what you're doing

1201
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
You understand what it is to sell into companies

1202
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
You're going to need all of this expert

1203
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
You're up against

1204
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,287
XYZ different now different companies are Technologies and they were they were like

1205
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
Good luck with your stupid little thing

1206
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
But did you

1207
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,663
Think those investor

1208
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:45,503
Where Ron eats it sounds like

1209
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Straight

1210
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
Well so

1211
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
By the time we officially launched

1212
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
It was evident

1213
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
That this was going to be something

1214
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,255
The Leaky bucket problem I talked about in the context of the game was

1215
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Completely

1216
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
We found that

1217
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Once people started using it

1218
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
Hard as it was to get people to start

1219
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Once they started

1220
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
It almost never stopped and

1221
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
But we can see that they were getting utilities

1222
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
They were

1223
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
They were logging out at the end of the day and

1224
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
And first thing in the morning they were right back in there

1225
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
CU luncheon

1226
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
February of 2014

1227
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Officially it goes down to

1228
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
The app store or whatever and add to the world

1229
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,951
Yep we also told other people who'd been using it for free like hey the grace

1230
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,511
Yeah this business now we going to have to start paying

1231
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Will give you a nice

1232
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Healthy credit

1233
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,119
To thank you for being one of our early testers

1234
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,679
We found the conversion

1235
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Within

1236
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
Maybe 2 weeks or 3 weeks of of launching that officially

1237
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
We had sold a million bucks

1238
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,431
By the way what does it cost

1239
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,735
It cost $80

1240
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
Per person per year that you would pay

1241
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
You only pay for the people who are actually easy

1242
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
If you have a 50-person company

1243
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
And there's 20 people using it that you just pay for

1244
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
20 people in the beginning it was like

1245
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
67 bucks

1246
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Per user per month sound like

1247
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Exactly

1248
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,887
So you launch it and within weeks you have a million dollars in Revenue

1249
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
To be fair it took us many many more weeks to get the second million because I wasn't all the pent-up demand

1250
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:18,687
You are Off to the Races unlike almost any enterprise software ever people would talk about it

1251
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
They would be in line at the coffee shop and they would say oh my God you got to start using slices amazing to change

1252
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:31,487
That they have to use it work now

1253
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,791
Completely different.

1254
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,607
This looks like a cat

1255
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:43,007
By October of twenty

1256
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
14 years after you shut down glitch in like have to break the news to all these people you raise

1257
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,551
120 million bucks it's is a 1.2 billion dollar valuation

1258
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,879
That's nuts that's totally insane yeah it was

1259
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,975
Sweetly is Hayden and Nino at that same. We're still growing like

1260
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:09,375
Somewhere between 5 and 10% a week how are you dealing with that. How are you hiring enough people

1261
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
How are you getting

1262
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
Getting through the day it was a pretty mad scramble you know and that year

1263
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:21,919
We went from maybe 10 or 11 I can hide a couple people

1264
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,759
At most all employees up to about 40 or 50

1265
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
At 80 people and it was breaking up forgot to move offices and

1266
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:38,559
We don't have enough desk people are sharing desks gradually we put some systems in place and we started hiring

1267
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,679
Professional to manage different parts of the business and now it's amazing

1268
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,519
So this has been called the fastest-growing business app

1269
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,567
Ever if you went from

1270
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,383
From launch in February 2014 to

1271
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
The latest valuation is

1272
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
5.1

1273
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
Billion dollars that wasn't

1274
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
September 2017m I probably is higher now

1275
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,695
Did the numbers just staggering I mean for something that was just a side

1276
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,767
Project that was never intended to be the business

1277
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Yeah

1278
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
You know it's just feels like

1279
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
All of the years of

1280
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,935
Sweat and toil and sacrifice

1281
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
All of the years

1282
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,543
Pressing on with a game you know what kind of failure after failure

1283
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
I've been

1284
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
A more than reward

1285
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
I can reward in

1286
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
Dozens of times

1287
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Dover

1288
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
All of the other

1289
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
8%

1290
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
Software development teams in the world videos this

1291
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
And

1292
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
That happened

1293
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Not that long after we launched

1294
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
And now there's like

1295
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
3-star Michelin restaurants

1296
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,071
Norwegian Department of

1297
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351

The Hartford Connecticut

NASA's jet propulsion lab

Aldi's in Norman

1303
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,591
Companies there's all these small companies

1304
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
We never thought it

1305
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,199
Even in our grandest Ambitions it was like

1306
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
A tenth of what it is today

1307
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,319
Do you think it was a possibility that you would not have discovered

1308
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,391
It's likely that this thing hiding right under your nose

1309
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
You just

1310
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
This should be our business was there possibly that could happen

1311
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Absolutely

1312
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Or that

1313
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,679
Dimensions of the difficulty telling the team and independent what that felt like

1314
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,471
It was hard not to let that

1315
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
Crash because it is

1316
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
Embarrassing make it so

1317
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Humiliating

1318
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
But it's such a

1319
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
Hard decision to make I think partly because

1320
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
What you hear is

1321
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
The never give up on your dreams

1322
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
You know resilience

1323
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Critic

1324
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
Keep going

1325
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,463
Fight the slog

1326
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
End

1327
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
I think that generally true I think

1328
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,863
Really important to persevere through things that are difficult

1329
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,679
But there's also a point Beyond which you're just

1330
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,703
Making a mistake

1331
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
What what keeps you up at night now

1332
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
Anything I mean

1333
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
Potential

1334
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
Editor's

1335
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
Order are you like I'm sad

1336
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,807
And you are you've got there many reasons for you to take a chill out and

1337
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,879
Relax right now I'd I lose all kinds of

1338
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
And this is where it gets really interesting

1339
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
To me the most fascinating part of the journey so

1340
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
Through a combination of

1341
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,863
Inexperience and probably arrogance when we're smaller I thought

1342
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
But my job is to be smarter

1343
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,703
And to make all of the important

1344
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
And if I make all the right decisions

1345
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Nothing

1346
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Set the story that we tell

1347
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
Back around a lot of companies

1348
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
But it was like a series of

1349
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,247
Strategic decisions that made all the difference

1350
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
But what I found is

1351
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
What matters is

1352
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,623
Apartments at the level of the organization

1353
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,463
Is it to degree that everyone's pushing in the same direction you're able to achieve some

1354
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:51,839
If people are pushing in opposite directions then you know you can put as much energy as you want in and and nothing happens

1355
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
So you know

1356
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
When were eight people

1357
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
It's

1358
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,239
Trivially easy for everyone to understand what

1359
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
You get to a hundred people and that's

1360
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Tomato

1361
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
2016 80 people to 3

1362
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
23 doubled

1363
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
Twice

1364
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
Emmett Mencia we have an all-hands

1365
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
I say hey put up your hands

1366
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
You been here for less than a year

1367
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
75% of the company puts up their heads

1368
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,927
Really difficult when the average 10-year solo

1369
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
I don't like that but like

1370
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
There's two people

1371
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
Or whatever on the Android engineering team

1372
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
And then there were the other working their butts off

1373
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,167
Developing yeah but they're also trying to hire the Third

1374
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Person in the third person starts

1375
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,263
And have all these questions they don't know what they're doing and then

1376
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,055
MIT trying to hire the fourth person

1377
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
And if the internet

1378
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
Black Chaos

1379
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
Can you really difficult to connect

1380
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Hold it together

1381
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
And

1382
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
A lot of this is just

1383
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
Kind of dawned on me over the

1384
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,135
As a CEO

1385
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,951
18 months behind where I should be

1386
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
And

1387
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,791
The challenges are starting to become clearer and clearer

1388
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
But let me ask you about

1389
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,887
1/2 questions

1390
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
Personal life

1391
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
So you mention that

1392
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
When your marriage broke up with soda

1393
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Even building

1394
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Financial

1395
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,103
Stress and you know you were worried about this and that

1396
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
You are now

1397
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
A billionaire I mean at least

1398
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
Sandpaper

1399
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
Does that eliminate

1400
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,015
Stress in your life does that mean that

1401
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Everything set everything is taken care of

1402
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,415
1 nominal correction we've been around for a long time

1403
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Company and I

1404
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,743
Not even I'm not even a billionaire on

1405
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,815
Okay I sure

1406
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,911
Makes my life easier

1407
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
There's all that research and I don't remember where we're at with

1408
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
What's the latest version of this book

1409
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
Like Beyond a certain amount of money doesn't make your life any better

1410
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,615
I really like this kind of dish three levels

1411
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
Wealth in the world

1412
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
The first level is

1413
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
I'm not stressed out about

1414
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
People who are no longer worried about the

1415
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,623
The credit card bills are student loans at level 1 of wealth

1416
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Level 2 is

1417
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
I don't care what's up

1418
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,351
I really want this thing but at $18

1419
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,655
There's a level where it doesn't matter which

1420
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
How much you spend

1421
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:10,335
Ultimate level of wealth is vacation cost

1422
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,151
How expensive hotel is where which flight we go on

1423
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,807
Beyond that I really don't think it makes a difference to feel incredibly fortunate and it's great to have all these

1424
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
I'm almost all of the way because

1425
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791
There's no happiness yeah and there's a lot of

1426
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
Suffering in the world and

1427
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
There's a lot of inequality

1428
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
Both of your companies

1429
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
Either you're well known companies

1430
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Were the product of pivots like

1431
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
You

1432
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
We're working on something

1433
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Completely different both happen to be games

1434
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,807
And then when you realize it wasn't a work

1435
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
You shifted

1436
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,391
First I Flicker and then to Slack

1437
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
I think you were able to

1438
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
See that

1439
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,815
Is easy to look back on it with hindsight say oh my gosh to a bar filled genius Workforce ID

1440
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
Is that the deal

1441
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,655
Do you think that's a fair assessment

1442
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
Well

1443
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,983
Remember where I read the

1444
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
Visual

1445
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
And that's

1446
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
A billion blades

1447
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Grass

1448
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
On this massive field

1449
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:21,759
Imma keep on playing golf and every blade of grass is like I believe a golf ball is going to

1450
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Fall on me

1451
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
It's only hit the golf ball and

1452
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
Turn off it's falls on some Blades of grass

1453
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
Msac

1454
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
It was me all along

1455
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,999
The ball is going to fall somewhere this is a kind of like

1456
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,607
I was on the cover of Forbes Magazine with black really successful

1457
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,167
If I didn't do this

1458
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:46,079
What's it mean to just like okay well we won't publish a Martino cover

1459
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,407
Someone was always going to be undercover someone was always going to be

1460
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,503
And I try to remain very conscious of that fact like there's a

1461
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,319
We work hard and we're clever and

1462
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,159
Experience and I think we did a lot of things right

1463
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,719
But there's a real increasing rate

1464
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,791
Turn Dynamic like once you start to have some SSS

1465
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
The rest of the sea

1466
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,375
Becomes easier

1467
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
Ultimate example of this

1468
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
We were going

1469
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,495
Really really quickly even before we launched

1470
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
And because of that

1471
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
The Press would write about it

1472
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
And because of

1473
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
Because investors were interested in wanting to invest

1474
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,711
We probably raised all his money

1475
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
And that God has more

1476
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,575
And that got us more interest from great applicants he wanted to come work in the company

1477
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
And the opposite is absolute

1478
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
1 stumble

1479
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,743
And you lose a couple of good employees and now investors are

1480
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Skeptical

1481
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,815
You have to scale back your emissions

1482
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:45,215
Now you're not doing anything interesting no one writes about you know and want to come work at your company investors are really not interested in you can you go to business

1483
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,495
So

1484
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,055
Noelle I am proud of all that we have

1485
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Accomplished

1486
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,919
Enormous amount of hard work by a lot of people there is this real

1487
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
Tailwind

1488
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:02,367
That really just makes it all of that stuff a lot easier

1489
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391

1491
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,839
Early days when interviewing job candidates for the company he would always ask

1492
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,631
3 question first one

1493
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
What's

1494
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
3 * 17

1495
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:22,335
Second one countries in Africa and a third question In which century was the

1496
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
The French Revolution

1497
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,687
Like you were disqualified if you got the answer

1498
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:32,063
But it was just a way to start a conversation

1499

00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
For sticking around because it

1523
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
It's time now for how you built that

1524
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,495
Enter a story starts

1525
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,287
In Charlotte North Carolina

1526
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,823
3 years ago

1527
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,383
Abby kircher was a teenager

1528
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,759
With a food Obsession I've always loved peanut butter flavored anything peanut butter

1529
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:40,159
Cups peanut butter ice cream I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

1530
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
But one day

1531
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
A beaded something

1532
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,303
Probably shouldn't do with a food you eat everyday

1533
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,631
She looked at the label and I was just like oh my gosh this is

1534
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
So much sugar

1535
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
Tons of additives and preservatives

1536
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
And so it just doesn't feel like it's almost

1537
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,615
Peanut butter in any more you know it just feels kind of like a sugar spread

1538
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,175
Baby decided to go cold turkey on

1539
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:05,247
Peanut butter but of course she missed eating it

1540
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:11,647
So I was like I might as well make my own there's no reason why I couldn't make my own so that's why I Just Whipped out

1541
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,207
Add a food processor in just tried it out

1542
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:19,071
This was by the way her mom's food processor into what she put some nuts

1543
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,351
And coconut oil

1544
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,751
And salt and eventually took forever it turned into a creamy texture is like wow this is so cool

1545
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:31,615
I got very excited then I was like okay how do I want to flavor this or Sweeney

1546
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
So I threw in some dates

1547
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,503
Process. A little bit and it was

1548
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,623
So good so good in fact that Abby started spreading the nut butter on everything

1549
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,951
Apple sandwiches pancakes even salad

1550
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,791
And she began sharing it with her family and friends and then

1551
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
One night

1552
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
I wanted to my room

1553
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
And it was

1554
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,471
Quite literally an aha moment and I just ran back

1555
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
I can start a business and she was like

1556
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,103
Oh right yeah absolutely

1557
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,943
It's a good thing Abby's mom and dad were on Ford because remember

1558
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,247
Abby was like 15 at the time

1559
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,647
So she needed her parents help to track down jars and labels in a commercial kitchen to make the nut butter

1560
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:22,559
But I'm still making a lot of the big decisions like early on she actually decided to forget about peanut

1561
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
And the branch out into

1562
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
Other types of nuts

1563
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
I wanted something a little different and I I realize there weren't a lot of pecan and cashew butter is out there at the time

1564
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:36,383
Time to Eddie came up with five recipes each with just a handful of ingredients

1565
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,175
Flavors like date pecan

1566
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Strawberry cashew

1567
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991
Toffee almond

1568
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:46,111
And Sheena Montana set up a stand at a big farmers market just outside Charlotte

1569
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:54,047
Call people over they were all incredibly can you buy the story and how young I was they would always looked at my mom

1570
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
Zombie like so

1571
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,375
You started this

1572
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
Anyway they kept

1573
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,191
Selling out at the Farmers Market

1574
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,239
And people kept asking for more

1575
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:07,103
That was getting hard because they were still packing the jars of nut butter themselves and

1576
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
How are they doing that

1577
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,687
Spoons believe it or not

1578
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,015
Many spoons mini mini hand

1579
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
That was the worst

1580
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
Part for sure it just took

1581
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:22,975
So long so few months later they got a machine to do the jarring for them and soon

1582
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,047
They were pitching their nut butter at local grocery store

1583
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
For a young girl and her mom to walk in there excited about a product and it made them excited

1584
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,007
I think that was a huge factor in our growth

1585
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,103
Less than two years after a bee started making nut Butters

1586
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,199
They were selling them like 300 grocery stores in the Charlotte area

1587
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,599
In overtime it was just a b and her mom doing this for older brother join the business and her dad actually quit

1588
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,999
His job to join them as well technically I'm the boss of my parents and brother yet

1589
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Which is

1590
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:03,935
Definitely a learning experience trying to figure out okay what are our positions in the business regardless of our

1591
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,263
You know what positions in the family that he's now been at this for

1592
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
3 years and I'm Not Butter

1593
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:12,383
Spread to nearly 1000 stores across

1594
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,919
East coast and Midwest

1595
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,735
Put in some pretty big chains like Wegmans and Lowe's

1596
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,831
Now we're set to hit a billion dollars in Revenue by the end of this year

1597
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
Which is pretty crazy because Abby kircher

1598
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
Is still just

1599
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
18

1600
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,791
Her business is called Abby's better as in b
