Egyptian Jews were accused of being traitors so Hines family had to flee to Israel

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
I was twelve at the time and no one in his family spoke in Hebrew in fact they didn't know anyone in Israel

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,112
When they got there they were housed in a tiny apartment in a rough part of

81
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808

Go to sleep and then

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
Everyday was the same routine

Student and

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
The principal called my father and said

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
Your son most probably is going to make a lot of money one day but

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951

But you must finish

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
Which high school did you finish with high grades

Did you feel it anyway

112
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Being a Jew

From European Time

121

Yes

122
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
I had a girlfriend

123
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Louis parents were from Poland

124
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
And her mother said to her

125
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
If you bring

126
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823

To the house

129
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919

130
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967

00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Bellflower

132

Yasso

133
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
We would make out in the garden

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
Then I owe you join the Army I was in the Infantry

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,839
And were you actually in combat or did you have a different kind of job

136
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
It was at the beginning in combat

137
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
Unit and

138
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Then

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
They realize that they would be much more efficient at organising entertainment for the soldiers that

140
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,455
Well they put me to do so my job was to put together

141
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
Bands and go from one

142
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Post

143
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
To the other for example I remember right after the

144
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Six-Day War

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
We went down to the Sinai

146
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
And drove

147
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
From one position to the other

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Weather

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Entertainers

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
And entertain the soldiers

151
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
NH position

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
That's what we did

153
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,871
Obviously that foretold what you would do with your life you would become a person in the entertainment industry but

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
What was that your first exposure to

155
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Tubing in

156
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
An entertainment

157
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
Environment it to actually organizing this

158
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Yes

159
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,695
Well that's a job they gave me yeah you know I don't know why they gave me that job I have no

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Background in it

161
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Out of the fact that I

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Play guitar.

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Little bit

164
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
But that's a job

165
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
They assigned me to Uso

166
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Why did the job I was assigned

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
When was that

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
What led you to kind of single maybe I

169
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
I should pursue this after at the Army

170
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
No

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
What let me to join a band

172
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
After I left the army

173
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
I was simply

174
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
The necessity to

175
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Make some money

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
And get out of that

177
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Ruhlman

178
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Support my family

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
But my father didn't happen

180
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
To go door-to-door selling pencils

181
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
At the time there was no television in it

182
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
As well

183
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
That was radio

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
And I used to play

185
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
You know Beatles songs

186
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
And

187
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
An hour behind

188
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
The lead singer

189
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Sounded exactly like McCarthy

190
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
So

191
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
We were pretty successful

192
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Even though I was a pretty lousy bass player

193
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
I've read that you actually were so badly

194
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
That you would turn down the apps

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
I just at the beginning

196
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
Yeah so where did you eventually get good at it

197
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
No

198
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
I was never good enough

199
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,215
It was just why one day the two brothers that were kind of the basis of

200
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
The band the lead singer

201
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Andy's by the way

202
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Was the solo guitarist

203
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Came up to me and

204
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
And said that

205
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
Why don't you be your manager

206
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
And

207
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Cuz you're holding us back music

208
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
And I couldn't

209
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Be happier

210
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,623
So one of the happiest days of my life was

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
The day I pulled on My Guitar

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
My last gig

213
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
And I became a manager and then

214
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
You manage one band and you manage

215
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Steuben's and then

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
You build a business

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
At some point you laugh

218
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Israel

219
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
It won't fit

220
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,591
I became a tour promoter in Israel and I bought

221
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Many artists

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Stories real from Ray Charles

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Jose Feliciano

224
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Blood Sweat and Tears

225
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,599
Many others how are you doing this is a 20-something year okd were just hustling you were just

226
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Convincing people

227
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
Said you were the guy to make it happen

228
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,791
Mark Zuckerberg a24 has built Facebook

229
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,655
Before I was able to bring Jose Feliciano to Israel what the heck

230
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
You're supposed to be

231
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Doing stuff

232
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
You know you're not supposed to be

233
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Visiting Ghana

234
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Counting on your parents

235
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Okay so so at some point

236
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
You moved to I get to Paris

237
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
When did you decide to do that and why

238
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Well I moved

239
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Des Peres

240
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Simply because

241
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Israel was really

242
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
From a business standpoint

243
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Kussmaul

244
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
And

245
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Despite

246
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
My Success

247
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Quote on quote

248
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
I was in

249
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
That

250
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Of $600,000

251
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Wait you were you at 6

252
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
$4,000 in

253
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
How old are you

254
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
By the time that happened I was 29

255
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
Did you accrue all that dead by the well

256
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
I had a big group of harpists from Japan

257
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
In October of 1973 ready to tour the country and the

258
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Yom Kippur War to Castle by surprise so obviously there were no

259
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
Concerts at was no shows there was no way for them to even leave cuz the airport was closed

260
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Most I had to return the money I had paid them in advance and I had a couple of

261
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
Other bumps in the road again that has nothing to do with me which is the devaluation of

262
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
Aldi's rallybound which meant that

263
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
We had big shows lined up where all of the expenses were in dollars and the revenue

264
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
What an Israeli pounds would this evaluation of the pounds we played to

265
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Full houses on losing money every night so these two things compounded. Me too

266
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
$600,000 in debt

267
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Freaking out I mean thinking how am I going to ever pay that back no I don't think I was freaking out that I wasn't supposed to stay

268
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Data panic

269
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Ghetto freaking out the shoes

270
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
You still have some control

271
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
But when you have a massive panic attack you have no clue

272
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
So what did you do

273
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
So I moved to France

274
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
And

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Tyson this nine-year-old who sounded

276
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,919
Like an adult and he was a fantastic singer and nine year old singer in Israel

277
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
You said he was going to help you pay off

278
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Well

279
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
I got very lucky I got very lucky

280
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
How did you get lice

What happened oh you know what

282
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Being lucky means

283
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
It means having the scale

284
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
To grab the lock when it's presented to you who was the luck that was

285
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Presented

286
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
Wildest first record that I produced

00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
Went platinum

288
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447

Deficient

Strike gold with this or platinum

296
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511

Record and you've got a career I guess in France like it at this point to you

What did you do did you start a production company in in in France

299
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
And I started production company that I set up my own label

300
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,151
And I sold over a period of 8 years that I live there

301
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
On my own label more than 18 million records

302
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Wow

303
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319

Some friends from childhood

307
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
But how did you even know how to

308
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
Had a wheel and deal and go get a studio together and and

309
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Define

00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Distributors

311
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
I have no idea

312
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
You just started knocking on doors

313
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Oh yeah

314
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Knocking on doors as what

315
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Guido Wright comedian

00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
Get ahold business people knock on doors

317
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
Old salesman knock on door

318
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
I learned it on the job I guess

319
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
You know I don't know I never produced the record in my life

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
When I produce that first record yeah

321
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
Why did you did you decide

322
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
To move to the US I guess

323
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
In the early 80s

324
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Well

325
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,263
I bought a house here in 1978 and I moved here in 1980

326
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
Yeah and what did you intend to do in LA

327
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Iowa

328
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
Planning to

329
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
Basically continue doing the same thing

330
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Which is creating

331
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
Reproducing and distributing music and

332
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Therefore I built the studio

333
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
In Studio City

334
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
And

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
We started

336
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Creating music

337
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Full cartoons

338
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Why cartoon how did you even

339
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Get into that that world at all

340
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Well I

341
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Studied

342
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
How music is

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Paid for in America

344
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Buy ASCAP

345
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
10 BMI

346
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Isla publishing

347
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
The agency

348
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
These are the publishing

349
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
She's got like 8 or they are as Representatives

350
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
Collection agencies

351
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Is what they

352
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
They pay royalties

353
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
And I pay royalties

354
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
So when I realized

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Is pow

356
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Much money there is

357
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
In this I thought

358
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
That would be a good idea

359
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
And was it because of her

360
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Meet with music in cartoons or just

361
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Any music

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
It's any music but music

363
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Cartoons music

364
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Can be very proud

365
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
The ball in his a reason why

366
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
If you look at the sitcom

367
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
There are musical stings

368
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
So they have cumulatively maybe 2 minutes of use

369
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Maybe three

370
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
Banana cartoon you have wall-to-wall

371
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,047
And because these collection agencies pay

372
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
Based on the number of Munich minutes that are

373
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
You would make a lot more money

374
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Drama music on

375
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
You know a little known cartoon

376
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Then you would make

377
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,455
On the Mary Tyler Moore Show or The Cosby Show

378
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,783
A lot more money how the cartoon how did you figure that

379
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,159
I called ASCAP and I said can you explain to me please GIF of the pocket in pocket

380
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
And I called BMI can you please

381
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,095
Explain to me Mickey Booker T Bucket and then I sat down and I calculated and I concluded

382
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
That being a member of BMI is the right way to go

383
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
And I went for it

384
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
And how did you

385
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311

And I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.

389
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
And I said to them

390
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319

00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087

410
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815

00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
So I mean how are you getting all of this music composed

423
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Well

424
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,887
At a given point we have so much work that was no way

425
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
That one or two composers can

426
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Satisfy

427
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Get all of the hundreds of epi

428
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,639
Like we were scoring

429
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
At one point had 12 Studios 12 Studios just making music for car

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Cartoons plug Studios making music for cartoons when people ask me what are you doing side make music for cartoons

431
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
I could see the compassion in their eyes cuz they thought it was no room for compare

432
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
I was making money hand-over-fist

433
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,079
Of course turning point in your life I guess

434
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Happens when you discover the

435
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Japanese

436
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Live action

437
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Show

438
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Why which of course became

439
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger

440
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Tell me how did you

441
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Come across this

442
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Boconcept

443
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Well in 1984 I was in

444
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Japan

445
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Nail stretching on my bed

446
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
Turn the TV on there only

447
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
3 channels

448
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Two of them showing game shows

449
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Alarms

450
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Some other reality base

451
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
That I do not

452
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Understand a word

453
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
And the channel had these

454
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Kitchen spandex

455
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Kicking monsters butt

456
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
And I thought

457
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Hey

458
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
This looks like

459
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,295
Like fun

460
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
All of a sudden dawned on me that once they turn into

461
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Superheroes meaning into Power Rangers

462
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
And they have the master song and there

463
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Kicking monsterbots

464
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
It could be

465
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Anywhere

466
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
The order of the action scenes

467
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Which is what cost the most money

468
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
What basic be accounted for

469
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,711
Choctaw qualify shooting American segment with American

470
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Kids

471
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
Being an American environment and I tie this up

472
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
Into the action

473
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Sequence icon

474
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
Create a show

475
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
Very little money because all the action scenes

476
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
I will purchase

477
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
And

478
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,191
That that sounded to me like a great idea never mind the fact that I truly

479
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Enjoy the show

480
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
It's funny I remember cuz I was at when I was a child we lived in Japan

481
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
From 1979 to 1980

482
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
U2

483
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
And remember I saw Mighty Morphin Power Ranger

484
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Bears on television America I recognized it immediately

485
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
He has a show that I watched

486
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
As a kid in Japan

487
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
What's the show called in in Japanese

488
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Jewelry

489
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Meaning 10 Ranger

490
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
Teach you bought this in August 1980

491
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Asics around them

492
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
No I bought it

493
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
84

494
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
And I slept it

495
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Remember cartoon Slappy slappy

496
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
And I slept at 480

497
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,383
What do you mean you would you try that you went around trying to pitch people on the show for 8 years

498
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Yes

499
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Well

500
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
I just loved it and I thought

00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551

00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343

504
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
At the time getting

TV

508
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
And then

509
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
I said to myself

510
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
My goodness

511
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607

513
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Something

514
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191

515
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959

That some people look at it.

520
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
Tempe cheesy I don't know I heard all kinds of definition

521
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
To me it's a lot of fun

522
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Show

523
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
And everytime I look at the pilot

524
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Over and over again

525
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
I just

526
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Couldn't figure out why

527
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
People don't see it and what do they say when you started today

528
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
They said

529
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
Why do you embarrass you

530
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311

00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,648
It's 1992 and Haim Saban has been trying to sell his idea for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 2

573
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Anyone who would listen

574
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
I'm pretty much no one is interested

575
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
Until he gets a meeting with an executive

576
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Xbox named Barker leche

577
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,400
And I'm like everyone before her

578
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Margaret

579
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Actually likes it

580
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
She's the only person who said

581
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
There's something there

582
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Something there

583
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,200
She orders the show to air in 1993

584
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
And

585
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
We go and produce

586
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
40 episodes

587
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Ruby strep

On the fox kids network which at the time is the number one Outlet

589
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
For kids

590
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,048
I'm producing it meaning I'm just there

591
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Whatever

592
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
Script every outline

593
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Every frame

594
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,032
Every daily every sound effects every piece of music every casting I'm not

595
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
You know letting this thing go to anybody yeah

596
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
Basically

597
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
What's wheat producer

598
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
There's a mutiny at Fox

599
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:55,136
Books from Rupert Murdoch on down and the group of a failure to basically say

600
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
This is

601
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Horrible when not going to air it

602
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
It is

603
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
This executive Margaret Leschi

604
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
But she goes to Patrick

605
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
So what she said she said look

606
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
I can fight

607
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
All my bosses

608
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264

618
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280

621
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
Leave the net

Well even told her that she's playing her career by putting this show on just scrap it

623
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
But you believed in it and she just put it on and within

624
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
Blessed and a weak beat every other show across the generator

625
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
The highest rating of any show on Fox kids beat at the time you had.

626
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
Looney Tunes or Tiny Toons you had Batman you had all these shows that wear their head up box kit

627
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
And he delivered double triple the ratings of all these shelves to a course that 8 weeks

630
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232

631
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
Escorting you douchka meaning in my cut

632
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632

633
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
London brain

634
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
I have to tell you that the biggest hits

635
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
That I had

636
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
In my life

637
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Any music

638
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Hunting television

639
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
And hunting business

640
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
Have been

641
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Always

642
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,296
As a result of significant which action

643
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
And repeatedly

644
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
So every time I have an idea

645
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,488
That people tell me no don't do that oops

646
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
And if you are mean

647
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
When that happened when that show was a hit

648
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Did you go to other people to die

649
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
Told you this was going to work hard for you just so I didn't have time

650
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Whatever I got my own

651
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288

655
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
To this point you got the

656
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
The production companies

657
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712

Entertainment

659
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
And then about a year later

660
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
It wasn't that

661
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Fox

662
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
To buy your product

663
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696

GameStop at the time

666
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
This is what brand 90

667
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Before 95

668
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
94

669
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
And

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
He has all kinds of Concepts that

671
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984

672
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288

00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
P****

Money exchange hands

675
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
We would put our content into

676
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
A joint venture

677
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
And he would put

678
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
The network

679
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Into that joint

680
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344

682
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440

687
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
Sephora Network about to own that Network

688
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
I'm only going to let you have that.

692
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296

I'm just trying to

696
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,512
Figure out why Rupert Murdoch would take that deal and he couldn't you just

697
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
Do all this without you

698
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,424
Was running Fox Gazette to duplicate Berkheimer

701
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
How long will it take

702
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
And she said

703
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
I can do it but it

704
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760

And he wanted to know work right away

706
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
He walked

707
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Presence

708
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
And that

709
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
Categoria and by doing this joint venture with me

710
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768

00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Half of fox

Half of the kid net worth

720
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896

Yeah I mean I wasn't going to do anything

725
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Bring in a partner

And I said look I got this

736
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
Not part of a Bitcoin

742
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880

At the television

750
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
Correct basically you wanted Fox

751
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,448
To help you convince Pat Robertson to sell it

752
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Right

753
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
And they said to me

754
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312

They say

762
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Monticello

763
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
But Tracy's going to meet with his son Tim

764
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Tim Roberts

765
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Pat Robertson son

766
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
Correct and maybe the price

767
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
To find some kind of GoPro

768
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Joni Mitchell

769
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
A few days later

770
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
And I say can I come and you said no no

771
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,896
I said okay fine they didn't want you there because they thought you were going to be

772
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Pain in the neck

773
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Because

774
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,832
Maybe they were concerned that I would be too pushy or I don't know I don't know the answer is I don't know

775
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
Care all I cared about

776
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Was the result

777
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,768
So he goes to the meeting with him he comes back and he says

778
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Nothing to do

779
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
I said okay you're done

780
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
You said you would. I said okay I want you to come

781
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
To a dinner with Tim and myself

782
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
Movies.

783
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
Should be you should have a dinner with

784
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Tim

785
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
And you should let me have a shot of

786
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Let me see if I can convince

787
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:47,808
Right and we said the three of us at dinner and I said what I said

788
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
We left the dinner with a deal in French

789
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,768
What did you say to him that made him I don't want to get into what I told him I want to get

790
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,424
Into I can tell you that chase told me at the end of the dinner you're crazy man

791
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
What are you doing

792
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,824
I just don't worry about it we'll figure it out

793
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:16,480
Houseman has a bit of an egg so it's not anymore

794
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Not true

795
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,904
What's not natural you speak English better than I

796
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,720
I was hustling okay you were hustling

797
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
Andy Robertson then says okay we have a deal. We had some sort of a joint venture

798
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Concept

799
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
That we agreed upon that through the negotiation evolves

800
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,384
Into basically

801
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Buying the whole chat

802
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,040
Open Fox pay for the whole thing and what they pay

803
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
1.9 billion

804
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Which

805
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
That sounds like a lot of money what was it a good deal

806
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
No it was not

807
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
It was a fantastic

808
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
Okay so you have the deal

809
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
And you bought this

810
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
What was a Christian

811
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Cable channel

812
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Transitioning into a kid show was that was it hard to do that

813
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:19,712
No look I mean we converted the channel from the channel That targeted people

814
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
80 +

815
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,832
80 years old plus size of a day was a disaster Zone

816
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,928
Yellow from the demographic standpoint so we struggled for a couple

817
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,512
And then as we were turning the corner

818
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
I realize

819
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
We had built the company

820
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
That was

821
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,240
Worth between 5 and 5 and 1/2 billion dollars

822
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,056
Competing with companies that will work

823
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
10 to 20 times that

824
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
The Disney's off this

825
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Miss World

826
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
And so on so

827
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
I came to the conclusion

828
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
That it's time to sell

829
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
Social wait this is about

830
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
5 years in

831
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Yes

832
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
And so you have this channel

833
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Fox Family

834
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
And then

835
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:09,120
What you decide you want to sell it right I mean you own half of it but then Suboxone half

836
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
It's like how are you able to sell

837
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Seoul

838
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
I had the right

839
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
Based on my contract

840
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Red fox

841
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
To put my share to them

842
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
Which I did

843
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
And we said

844
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
Negotiate

845
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
They told me that they thought my share was worth half a billion I told them that my share is worth 2 billion

846
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
Let's sit down and talk

847
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:37,024
Yeah but half a billion dollars that's a lot of money mean wow

848
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,608
But you could have walked away at that point with half a billion dollars in

849
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,472
Would have been up I wasn't going to walk away with a half a billion dollars that was not a shot in hell I was

850
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Want to do that okay

851
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
My stake in the company's what do Belgium that's what I thought

852
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
So what did you end up doing into a pissing match with my boss

853
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Give me a property to sell it

854
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,416
If I can sell it for four and a half billion dollars would you sell it with me so you're sure they said yes

855
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,488
That I ended up selling it for 5.3

856
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
What the hell did you do that

857
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Whatever two potential buyers

858
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,400
When was CBS and the other one was this

859
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
And Disney was

860
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Really

861
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Very interest

862
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Stead ndic

863
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,128
And they ended up putting up

864
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
The right amount of money

865
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Tortillas

866
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,248
I mean that that meant that you play walked away with

867
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
Easily with more than a billion dollar

868
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
1 + 1/2

869
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
She become a billionaire

870
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Overnight

871
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Yes

872
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:43,328
Why was it so important for you to get a billion and a half dollars rather than

873
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Half a billion right I mean

874
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Was it the money that was

875
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
That was important was it

876
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
The principal or was it

877
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Something else

878
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
What about

879
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
Important to me it was more about what is fair

880
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Time in Douglasville

881
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
The fair price

882
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
For the asset

883
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Anyways money

884
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Was getting becoming really rich

885
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
It does that motivate you

886
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
You know it's awesome

887
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Only

888
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
Money but it was also

889
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Money is a marker

890
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
To success

891
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Yeah

892
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,328
We could we could continue this conversation and talk about

893
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
You bought Univision and 2000

894
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Sex

895
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
And then you know you eat

896
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Cricket in Bessemer

897
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Find like that

898
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Is it

899
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
Is it work is it

900
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,104
Getting to a higher number is it

901
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Is a recognition what is it that motivates you

902
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
The joy of working like what is it that keeps you going

903
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Everyday

904
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
Look I don't collect stamps

905
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
And I don't play golf

906
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Yeah you know I don't have

907
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,024
Hobbies other than playing my guitar this is

908
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
My hobby

909
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
That you're getting

910
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Deals done and

911
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Making Investments and so on

912
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,288
And look it allows me to do things that I truly enjoy

913
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
Witches

914
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Give a lot of money

915
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Back

916
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
This incredible

917
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,064
Country that has given me so much about Unity the United States

918
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,904
And Israel which took me in when I was a refugee

919
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,720
So there's a lot of gratification in that

920
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
When you look in the mirror

921
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
In the morning

922
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,936
Do you see Haim Saban

923
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
If this is billionaire Mogul or do you see that

924
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Kid

925
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Who was

926
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
You know doing his homework in the stairwell

927
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
EBay

928
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Modest

929
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
Department building in Tel Aviv

930
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
I see neither

931
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't see myself as a mobile node do I see myself as a

932
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Impoverished

933
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Child

934
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,488
I just see a guy hurrying golf to use

935
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
The next phone call or next meeting

936
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
Today he runs an investment firm it's called the Saban Capital group but he hasn't stopped

937
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:06,688
Cartoon The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie is out in the theaters and his name

938
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
Is it right there in the title

939
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,552
I'm glad that you remember the theme song to Inspector Gadget

940
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
Gabba Gabba the Inspector Gadget

941
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Right where the song

942
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,488
It is one of the best theme songs I think

943
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Eva it really is

944
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Yeah it's

945
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,632
Almost as good as Go Go Power Rangers

946
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
That's a that's a power pop

947
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for POW you built that and it comes from Paul

961
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
Call Tucker of Yorba Linda California consultant in the beverage industry for the past 20 years

962
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
And over that time he's also been brewing his own beverage

963
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
20 years and pretty quickly realized that the magic ingredient in craft beer is the Hops

964
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
Start a brew with Hobson

965
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
One day I had some left over and it just hit me that the Hop should be enjoyed on more occasions and how come

966
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
It's only in craft beer

967
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,704
No that's not necessarily a question everyone would ask bacon Maybe

968
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
But hops

969
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Who knew it's a very subtle flavor you know it's something that is really pleasing and really pairs well

970
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Well with food and

971
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,320
The more I looked at it the more I said wow this could be a whole new category but instead of coming up with

972
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,904
Another artisanal chocolate bar or a

973
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,000
Hops infused cheese Whataburger new drink

974
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,816
Maybe even a drink with no alcohol

975
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
As much as I love craft beer you can't drink it on All Occasions so yeah I started experimenting and

976
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:42,080
Probably about a year of research and many failures and trying different varieties

977
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
Came up with something that I thought was just phenomenal but parking up with has no barley no yeast

978
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
No fermentation no alcohol

979
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
And best of all

980
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,392
No calories Paul basically made up

981
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,976
Hops flavored sparkling water

982
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
They think of

983
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:04,352
Bitter but you know there are over a hundred varieties of hops

984
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,680
And lobster we use these Aroma Hops at

985
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Citrus

986
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
Send Pine flavors grapefruit

987
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
It's really complex

988
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,128
And what I consider the spice or the magic ingredient

989
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,736
So Paul took his creation to a beer festival in San Francisco and

990
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,088
At first he was a little nervous about what beer drinkers would think

991
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,416
But when people came up and tasted it people were like

992
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
Wow you know this is

993
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,560
Legit the flavor is really interesting and refreshing and

994
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
That's what I knew that it's not just me

995
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
Think about this for a moment

996
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,472
Sparkling water is super hot right now

997
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
Just ask the company that makes Lacroix and

998
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
It's no secret that craft beers huge

999
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
Paul disfigured put them together

1000
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
And he's managed to get his drink

1001
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
Into a few small retailers in restaurants

1002
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
That he's not making a profit yet but this year

1003
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
He's expecting sales

1004
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
Adult and if I can get it to the point where

1005
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,328
A big company would like to pick this up and distributed worldwide then you know I would feel

1006
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Fantastic about that

1007
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
