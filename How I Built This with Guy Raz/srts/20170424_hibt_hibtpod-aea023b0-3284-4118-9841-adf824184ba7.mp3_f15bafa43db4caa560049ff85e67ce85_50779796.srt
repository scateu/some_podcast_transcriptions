Hey everyone it's Sky you're just a quick note to tell you

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,320
There is a little bit of bad language in this episode so if you've got small kids around

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
You just may want to be mindful of that

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Thanks

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,792
She came to me and she knew I had to fire a lot of people cuz you could just see that

16
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Everybody knew something about shake. And she said one should probably fire me if you fire me

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
You said no one else could be angry with you when you fire them and she was right so at that Monday morning meeting we always had at 9

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
9:30 I said so surprised how bad things are going to have to make a lot of changes and it's going to be

19
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,344
Very hard for me to do but the hardest changeables required my mother

39
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
Figured stuff out along the way

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920

Wasn't the best student in fact

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
She didn't excel at school at all

Quora

57
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Big Irish Catholic Family

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
9 brothers and sister

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Hampton Apartments

60
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Edgewater New Jersey

61
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Even though

62
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
They have almost nothing

63
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
She remembers a childhood that was

64
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Basically happy

65
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
I mean we all had our issues as every family does

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
But

67
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,632
It was well-organized my mother was like a drill sergeant so even though we all

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
Lived in such Close Quarters was meticulously clean and everything was put in order when my mother snifter

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
We had a side yard

70
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
Which we controlled it was a skinny little side yard but

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Most of the house in Edgewater were back-to-back so we felt wealthy even though we're renting the ground floor we felt Wealthy by

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
By comparison

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,928
And also my dad was a printing press form and I had to wear a suit to work

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,512
And every other guy in the town seemed to work for the lunar Factory or the

75
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
Coffee company in a uniform

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
So I kind of thought of us as like

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
The Kennedys like

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Whoa We were something

79
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
At school it was a different story

80
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Barbara struggled a lot

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
But everyday when she get home from school

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Her mom

83
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Was right there

84
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Ashy

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Never

86
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Told you what was wrong with you

87
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
She always told you

88
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,160
What she thought was amazing about you and sheep in one thing on each kid so each kid knew what that thing was

89
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,976
I have a wonderful imagination

90
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,840
So when I couldn't pass any subjects in school and I was really upset I remember distinctly one

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
The nun from Hell sister Stella Marie told me I'd always be stupid I was so upset to hear that word stupid I get a label finally

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
And my mother said don't worry about it with your imagination you learn to fill in all the blanks so I didn't learn to read

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
But I slept okay I can fill in the blank today I fell for

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
You know and she's right

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
Because I did have a good imagination or at least

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Maybe I'll learn to have

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Because of her

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,488
By the time she was 22 Barbara was working as a waitress at a diner in New Jersey

99
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
And one night

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
During a shift

101
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
An older man

102
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Dapper

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Confident charismatic

104
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
What's in for a bite to eat

105
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
And when Ramon Simone

106
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
I walked into my life

107
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
And set up

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
My counter

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Call what you wanted was a lucky break

110
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
It was like you could

111
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Hell

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
That he was some

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Elsia

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
And he had a suit on

115
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
And he didn't have just a suit

116
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Breast collar

117
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
With a shiny toy

118
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Shiny shoes

119
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,999
And he had all navy blue Aviator Shades I couldn't really see his eyes

120
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Also

121
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
He told me

122
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
He was from The Basque

123
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
I know where that was what I

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
It wasn't a New Jersey

125
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
And he told me it was a warrior tribe or sometime

126
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Cool

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
Now later I learned his name wasn't Ramon Simone with an accent

128
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Mother Vicki who I got

129
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
How many years later

130
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Said his name was Ray Simon Big Dipper

131
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
And he wasn't from The Basque country was 440 5th Street Harlem

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
But good for him again what a merchandiser

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
And so he had a lot to do

134
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Teach me

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Okay and

136
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,119
I got a new family with your his three girls we moved in with us after I moved in with him I didn't know you had

137
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
This is your first

138
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
True life I love you

139
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Sure it was a true love but

140
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
Someone who is different

141
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Can anyone I have ever met before

142
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
For older

143
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Successful in life had a big car

144
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
I hate the

145
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Biso

146
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,039
Detritus to say that impress me but it was a Lincoln Continental

147
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
With real leather seats

148
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
And when you offered me that ride home from the diner that

149
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
That first night I remember thinking he had sprinkled talcum powder on the

150
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,071
All of his seat because I was sliding around

151
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
That's just called real leather you know

152
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Was that

153
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
But your life is going to

154
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
BMW

155
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
Have bigger ambitions

156
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
You know honestly I have never had that

157
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
And I I can even say

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Along the way

159
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
A building a successful life

160
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
It's not like I really had any big thoughts about when I be successful I just had more of a

161
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Curiosity

162
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Let's just see how far I could go

163
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
That was it

164
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Curiosity

165
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,215
No one in my family has ever gone to college when I got into a college I just couldn't believe it but it was old girls

166
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,079
A college that had previously the year before been a nunnery that made nuns I forget what

167
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
And they're only 30 spot so just opening they took

168
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
That basically not realize I took anyone

169
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
But that was just a lucky break

170
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
And it didn't interfere with my work I was holding three jobs all the way through

171
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Please work

172
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
So

173
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,791
It just kind of happened you know that I one thing led to another

174
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
How did you find your way to real estate

175
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
I was working as a receptionist for the jacuzzi Brothers here in New York City answering their phones a million times a day good morning GIF funny brother

176
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Quit my job is

177
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
The waitress who are the different Brothers

178
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
It was Joe and his other

182
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Andrew

00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Who ran the business but show is really

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Play the power

They hired me

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
And then within a couple of months

188
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
Ramon satrina with your personally barbecue be great at real estate sale

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Okay I'll try it on your why not added

190
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
I think I turned twenty-two draws maybe 23 by then

191
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
I said why not

192
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Give it a whirl

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
And they gave me $2,000 charge

194
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Just like that

195
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Yes

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
Circus Ramon gives you a thousand bucks and then

197
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
How did you

198
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Did you start your own real estate

199
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
The only person I knew was Mister phony

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
And I asked him if he would just let me rent one of

201
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Apartments the same building where I answer the phone every

202
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
And he gave me a listing

203
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Try to rent

204
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Apartment 3L

205
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
And so when I saw three out and what he was asking if he was

206
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
330 a month

207
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Roughly there

208
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
I looked at everything I know how do I

209
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
It's it was a dungeon he gave me the worst

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
It was a challenge maybe nobody

211
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
In the back was like a super

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
But when I saw the list

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
And looked in the New York Times and saw

214
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Reams

215
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Reams of ads red identical

216
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Play one-bedroom 341 bedroom

217
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
33051 it was all the same I'm thinking how do I

218
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,215
Spend my three-line ad why is it was remember I had $1,000 I provided it by my overhead

219
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
And I knew I had seven weeks to stay

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
According to my map

221
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
And so I asked him if he build a half wall

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
To divide the

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Dentistry part of the living room from the L next door

224
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,319
With a double entrance and I told him I thought I could get him 360 a month

225
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
What's the weather

226
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
20 $25 more than you wanted

227
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Yeah he said he

228
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
And I got it for him cuz Maya

229
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
1 bedroom and den

230
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
For the same price that everybody else was working on one bedroom light.

231
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
The first Sunday I must have gotten 60 phone call

232
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
And so easily rented that apartment and then got others and got us an adjustable

233
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
And you were you were

234
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Basically making a

235
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Mission Beach rental

236
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
I made exactly what the

237
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
What the

238
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
Monthly rental was I when I rented that first apartment I did the the smartest thing in the world knowing I was ahead of the game

239
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Because I collected the commission within a week that's what's beautiful

240
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
You have to wait for a sale closing

241
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
So I collected that

242
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Check for misophonia

243
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
I cached Citibank and I ran right over to Bergdorf Goodman's and I blew it on a new coat

244
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
And it was a smartass and I could have

245
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Because I dress like a

246
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
A poor kid from it

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Nothing was being I just looked not the park

248
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
But I thought the fanciest damn code

249
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
A brown and white herringbone is real pearl buttons down

250
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Three quarter length

251
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Real fur not fake

252
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
And I wore that coat

253
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
For the next 3 years

254
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
And you want to know it was a smartest thing I could have done with the money cuz in and I felt powerful Joe

255
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
I'm cool man I'm a cool girl

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,655
Which best college business

257
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I was called Corcoran Simone

258
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
With an accent on the Simone I kept the acting so I really thought it was

259
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Pretty sophisticated

260
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
All right meniscus cuz Raymond on part of it

261
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Yes

262
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,783
So why you were like why you were going out and working as an agent to rent apartments what was Raven-Symone doing

263
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Ramon Simone

264
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
Ramon Simone

265
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Little flask

266
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
I'm Ramon Simone was building one family houses in New Jersey

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
You should question

268
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Three or four houses in making a very

269
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Good living

270
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
And that went on for probably

271
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
3 years or so hazard

272
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
Call and then one day a week

273
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Drove to his accountants

274
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Office in Hackensack New Jersey

275
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
And he had me wait in his car with the car running comes out in

276
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Guess what

277
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
I thought it was a joke and I moved immediately out of his fancy apart

278
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
I moved into his mother's

279
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Hackensack house

280
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
And that was the bed

281
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Your ass where are we

282
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Not undercover but had a

283
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,303
Up from the Earth all over again he did he was a great entrepreneur

284
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
I took about 3 years and those were the

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
The very very

286
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Tough years

287
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
But lucky for both of us on the rental business was

288
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Paying for itself and we're able to eat

289
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
He got a salary you were running this from your

290
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
From from that apartment

291
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
No no no no no no I had an office I initially ran

292
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Corcoran Simone

293
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
A from an apartment I shared with two roommates

294
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
On 86th

295
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
But then when I could afford to I subleased a desk from an accountant

296
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
On East 60th Street

297
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
And by the time we moved into Ramon Simone's mother's house

298
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
We still have the office on 60th Street

299
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
We already had

300
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
I guess maybe 10 or 11 Des occupied by rental

301
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
So you were going into

302
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
Manhattan everyday

303
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Yes

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
It was like it was like the Land of Oz you know the minute I stepped foot into Manhattan

305
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
I saw for what it was like where have you been all my life

306
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Clown

307
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
This is like

308
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
The

309
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
The violent 90

310
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
1870s New York

311
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Minecraft

312
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Son of Sam

313
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
What was it like

314
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
2 I mean

315
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Is it hard to to get

316
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Tenants to rent

317
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,703
It's crazy to imagine today of course but back then was it

318
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Was it hard

319
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
To get people to read

320
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
No it's saved my ass in those days

321
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Was you have Corporate America

322
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
Very well implanted in Midtown granted

323
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
It was dangerous you wouldn't dare Park

324
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Car on the street you know

325
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319
Gets broken into Sirens were always going off everywhere

326
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
So was not easy but fortunately

327
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
You had him

328
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Please

329
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
Young employees coming into New York City who had to live there working for these corporations

330
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
If not for that I don't think I would have stayed in business because I went door-to-door and knocked on all these corporate

331
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Personnel departments to try to get business I saw with the traffic

332
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
I was coming from

333
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
And I had

334
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Great

335
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
I said that

336
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
People to me one act

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Another after another

338
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
And so I had a huge Edge over my other small competitors

339
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Because I had a steady stream of

340
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
People coming out

341
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Yeah that was kir I don't think I could have stayed in business

342
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
How did you make the transition from renting from looking for renters to

343
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Selling

344
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Really quite by accident

345
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
I had gotten a referral of a young engineer from Union Carbide I don't

346
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
I called his name and I lined up a whole bunch of stuff

347
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
How to show him like I usually did cuz I had to learn by then and sales of

348
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Control someone's time

349
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
They can't go to anyone else I would say

350
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
I'll pick you up at the Drake Hotel

351
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Snow new name

352
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
At 9

353
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
And be aware we won't be finished till at least 5:30

354
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Entertain going with

355
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
With another brokerage

356
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
And then I would tell Midway to I've got everything set up for tomorrow to just control Park them in your garage and don't let the cat

357
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
I had this young guy

358
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,447
And I showed him the first two apartments he said well what am I going to see the ones for sale

359
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
I said oh no these are Ferengi said no I want to buy something

360
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
I was like

361
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
So I said well that's X1

362
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
So I said I was going to take him on a tour of all New Yorkers was very important for him to learn all the neighborhoods to see what he could choose for

363
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Nike react

364
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
2 best

365
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
And that the next day we would show him the Sayler Park

366
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Of course I had no

367
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,071
So I got them in a taxi walking around every street showed him every every place in town and then that

368
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Night I went home and I

369
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Hit the Floor running

370
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
I dropped them off at

371
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
Like 515 as early as I could

372
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Cold every single

373
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,895
Apartment where the owner are which was very common those days and said I have a young engineer he's looking

374
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Exactly four

375
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,063
Your apartment on Sutton Place he's looking for a small tear that read them had back and go but he must see it tomorrow

376
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Yes come on over and I

377
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Book everything that night

378
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
And the third apartment we saw he bought the neck

379
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
That's what got me in the sale business and when I got back

380
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
Commission check in my head was 38500 switch

381
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
At 6:12

382
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,215
I can't do the math anymore shame on me but 6% of that

383
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,103
Do you know what I I got that check in my hand on closing and I thought God has given me this to open up a

384
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
Apartment I hired two sales agent

385
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
Turn that was the birthing of the sales business

386
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
And all the while you were still

387
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
Let me Ray is still part of this thing you still in your life

388
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Yes Ray was still part of my life

389
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
Because that was within the first seven years we stayed together for 7 years

390
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
Until he married my secretary

391
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Really like

392
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Like so emotionally

393
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Encouraging

394
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Real up house

395
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
He cheated on you

396
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
With your secretary

397
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Yes

398
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,175
She was kind of innocent they fell in love I was angry with him but of course directory

399
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Women tend to do

400
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
And so when I wanted to fire her

401
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,183
Miss I said I can't come in the office every day and see your fiance they were getting married 3 months is very fast

402
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
I'm mortified I was mortified

403
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
And and then he moved Tina into our combined office I had to look at them through the glass world

404
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,727
Stupid thing I must been so young at heart to be so injured over some stupid

405
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,079
But here's the thing I said I have two fires and no I'm looking trolling partner

406
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,711
You can fire her he owns half of this company and Nelly owns 51% and

407
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,551
That's how I found out the value of that 1%

408
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
That's how it works

409
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Yeah but that didn't last long one year later I I stopped in there finally Built My courage and told him I was sending the business

410
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
I said

411
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
REI

412
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
I'm going to end the business today in this is how it go

413
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
We're going to do it like a

414
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
14 salespeople you can pick

415
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
First I'll pick the second I got a thing

416
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
So we each got seven

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
Like their children in a divorce I didn't know what was happening

418
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
And we also had close to $77,000 in receivables which I remember at the time thinking half of

419
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
That would get me through month-and-a-half of over

420
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
And so

421
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
I had the ability

422
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,487
To take my half of the money and start all over

423
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,095
And lucky for me I went to my landlord in our existing building

424
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
We were on the 8th floor

425
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
And I asked him if I could release another floor we had always

426
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
Pay the rent on time and he rented me the 11th floor bar

427
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Havre which I love being above him is not weird I'm sick

428
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
I really need a shrink he started he

429
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,735
He start his own company and then you stayed there and renamed it

430
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Poke Simone

431
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
His wife's name is Poe

432
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
And I moved up to 11

433
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
It my seven people I told my Monday would be

434
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Moving in there like

435
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Wow where we moving to I said

436
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
It's a surprise

437
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Was wasn't surprised

438
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
To me even

439
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
But by Monday you could open an office in the

440
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
You could buy the

441
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Just John decrepit 42nd street and have those guys asked

442
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Basically run the desktop

443
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,383
You could order a phone which I did on late Friday morning and had installed on Saturday

444
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,503
And by the time they just came in I called him over the weekend gave him the new address with you

445
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
They came in that all their stuff in a neat box on top of the new desks like nothing had happened

446
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,559
Here's a question

447
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
Is it are you are you just

448
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Sort of

449
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Hardwired as a

450
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Tough person means

451
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
I mean mostly the best men pretty

452
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,871
Play Rock right I mean in this the guy that you're with for 7 years

453
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
You think you're loving and in the meanwhile

454
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Peas

455
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Well

456
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
Hey listen the truth be known I'm not at all hard person

457
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
I mean the idea

458
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
Ask any woman who's been cheated on any guy

459
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,327
You feel like such a fool and you burn so deeply inside no

460
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
I can barely walk

461
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
I received estimated by that

462
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
It wasn't that I

463
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Even so much lost faith in him

464
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
I mean you're allowed

465
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Fall in love

466
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Be real with somebody else

467
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
But it was that I fell out of love with me

468
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Myself

469
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
I actually thought

470
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
My God I was nobody

471
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Before he found me

472
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
He got me to believe in myself he put me in business

473
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Eno with my mentor

474
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
He's a man of the world

475
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
You know and all of a sudden

476
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Keystone off of somebody else

477
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
It was like

478
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm nobody I never actually questioned

479
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Whether I was capable of any

480
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Until

481
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
He insulted me on the way out

482
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
What he saying

483
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
He said you'll never succeed without me

484
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Weights

485
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
He

486
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
He was having an affair

487
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
And then he rubbed salt in your wounds by saying you're never going to succeed with

488
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Yes

489
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
And you know what

490
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Janome remember we live together

491
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
Almost seven years I was his business

492
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
He may have even been wanting to motivate me knowing that I'm good when I'm insulted and you know I have learned

493
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
Was every one of my great successes building the business the ones that were Bellwether changes that I thought water that may

494
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Make a change

495
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
There are always a result of an inch

496
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
Fuel to your fire says this and you are

497
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
I mean obviously

498
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Devastated inside but you

499
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
You just think

500
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
The greatest revenge is I'm going to

501
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Cruise

502
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Said he's wrong

503
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,975
What wasn't even a Revenge thing honestly it was like I couldn't

504
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Stan the idea that

505
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
He might see me fall

506
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Worthy opposite

507
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
And you want to know something I got to believe

508
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,471
That was all tied into cuz it injured so deeply

509
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
And became my motivation

510
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
I have to believe that that was tied into being a dumb kid at school

511
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,895
He was basically damning me to hell

512
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
Yeah and that's how I felt in school every

513
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Like I'm a loser you'll go nowhere

514
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
And so he hit my hot button

515
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Pusher

516
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
And I'm for sure

517
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
So did you

518
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
From day one when you go to the 11

519
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Inflorescence

520
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Can you start your

521
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
Are you thinking

522
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,447
We was he your main competitor was his company the one that you were

523
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
I moved off of

524
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
I just I was in survival mode

525
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Figuring out the math

526
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,663
Knowing had six a six-week run to stay in business 6 weeks

527
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
How much cash

528
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
Yeah because I had a bigger overhead by then you know in the beginning with my thousand dollars gave me a little bit longer

529
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,416
This was just one ad per week in the New York Times three lion head

530
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,488
Whatever cost then am I sublease charged

531
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
When I move to the 11th floor

532
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
I also have 14 desk

533
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
But I only had seven age

534
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Problem

535
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
And that's a big overhead no no income

536
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
Are classified ads were really expensive at that

537
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
Well they always were

538
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,200
Going up in price yes so they didn't go very far but you know that was the bloodline of the real estate

539
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
Was pretty internet if you wanted to get a leave

540
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
You put an ad in the paper

541
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Were you

542
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Freaking out

543
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Kenosha

544
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
Actually no I never freaked out about

545
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
I never have

546
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Because it is what it is

547
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
You know I can't have matter-of-factness

548
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
Another word for okay

549
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Give it a shot

550
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
If I'm going to fret about oh my God oh my God it's going to get again

551
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,032
Cocky and big head this is no big deal

552
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
I'm going to get cocky

553
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,896
So I just kind of okay this is what I got let's see how

554
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
Hard and fast I can run

555
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
However

556
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
I did have one vision

557
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
I must admit

558
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Did they open the kor'kron

Group

560
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
I remember sitting at that

561
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,464
Desk and paying extra dollar a month for a pink princess phone you pay $2 extra to rent

562
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Was pink

563
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
I remember answering a phone sitting there

564
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
And thinking

565
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
I'm going to

Barbara story

610
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
She may have thought she was going to be the queen of New York real estate but

611
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Who's going to be an uphill battle

612
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
She's broken up with her mom

613
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Split everything up

614
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
She had a pink princess phone in her new office

615
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
And

616
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Figure out how to get more attention for

617
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Company

618
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
One of the world's most

Repetitive

620
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
I distinctly remember the day

621
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,800
I sat and pause and said to myself

622
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Holy Ship

623
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
We are going to be success

624
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
What happened

625
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
I came up with the idea

626
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
I'm taking our

627
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
11 sales for the year

628
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,880
We had 11 sales so far whatever time of the year that wasn't dividing by

629
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
11

630
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
It's good I was always

631
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
11 * 2

632
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
And I came up with an average sale

633
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
Pricing I typed in one piece of paper

634
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
And I named it after myself the Corcoran

635
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,912
Report and it looked lonely one number average apartment price I didn't say

636
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
Corcoran group I just put average New York City of

637
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
And on the top I put

638
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
The quokka

639
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Report

640
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
And then I thought it needed something more

641
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
The empty and I put

642
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
Market I can't remember some long-winded like market report of conditions and Trends in the greater New York City Market area

643
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Nothing to fill up

644
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
I mailed it out to everyone wrote for the New York Times

645
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Everyone

646
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
And I never heard from the times

647
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
At all but about two weeks later

648
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
I open up

649
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
The real estate section wechat

650
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
Portion the main generator that an automobile sex

651
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Buffalo New York

652
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Times before the internet

653
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,104
And I opened it up and the front page read New York City prices

654
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
All Time Low

655
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
We're in a recession again

656
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,504
And the first line said according to Barbara Court

657
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Present of the Corcoran

658
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Holyshit

659
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Can't believe this

660
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
I knew my business was going to be successful

661
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
You just made this isn't this amazing

662
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Particular sales numbers

663
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
Property

664
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,144
411 Culebra is you divide that decided up and then you said

665
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,008
Hey this is the average price of a Manhattan I didn't really say hi where I put I put

666
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
Average New York City

667
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:26,944
And price and snow that sounds really I could see now from where I sit that is mostly I didn't intend it that way

668
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,272
You know I didn't tend to trim it up with that long

669
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Conditions in Friends

670
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
But

671
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
You know it was amazing to me

672
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
That

673
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
The newspaper

674
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Printed my number

675
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,768
Do you like your new added

676
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Newsletter

677
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah but also there were no number

678
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
Remember there was there was Dell public data

679
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
Of apartment prices in the vacuum

680
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
Of no numbers I supplied a number and they wanted to do a story on the bed mark

681
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Can I put a label on

682
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
I bet it was right so did you start getting calls

683
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
From people who set up

684
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Group

685
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
We got instant credit

686
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,344
We called the listings on the

687
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
For sale by owner ads

688
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,000
And most of them had heard of us in one day

689
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:17,376
Well everybody read the time so if you aren't page if you were looking to sell your home your reading the front pages in your

690
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Real estate

691
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
Without a doubt

692
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
And when they didn't hear of us

693
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
My broker started thing

694
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Things like I'm sure you've read about us

695
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,920
Today's times will last week's. That didn't take them long to use it

696
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:35,040
So we got listings more easily we got credibility more easily and we got more phone calls

697
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
All

698
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Claws

699
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
We are quoted as

700
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
That's it

701
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Wow internet

702
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,488
Presumably that was the first of the carpenter part you even that didn't stop

703
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
Sending that

704
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
I got it out every three

705
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
3 months

706
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
And eventually was normalcy credible

707
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,984
Based on thousands of sales you could really trust them

708
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,056
But initially if I had been a big company

709
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
And I'd run it by attorneys wedding

710
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Committee decisions it would have never gone out

711
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
The Beulah had a little guys I had the freedom to run

712
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,440
70s in New York

713
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
A more welcoming place for a woman to

714
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,608
Typically a company or was it still I mean you know you care about that

715
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Menu

716
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,728
He rui women were sort of in a relegated to being secretaries and type business like that

717
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
Did you feel like you were

718
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Respected and treated

719
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
You know what things

720
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
No I never paid attention

721
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
I don't give a crap

722
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Really

723
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
You know

724
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,368
The whole business was 90% female wasn't like women we're not in the real estate broker's fee

725
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
But it just happened that all the firms

726
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Bosses were all men

727
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
Okay so yes so they weren't

728
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,864
Female only businesses that I competed with but that was

729
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,960
Was not even important detail what an important detail my mind

730
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Who's that I have for teenager

731
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,848
And the largest company in town at that point Douglas Elliman

732
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Headlight

733
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Maybe 80-90 agents

734
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
That seemed to me like

735
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
IBM it

736
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
Yeah how am I going to compete with them my I was on that bull

737
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
How did you know

738
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Barbara

739
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
How to even

740
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
Run defense I mean I know we're talking now right

741
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
Early 1980s and you've been working with Rafe

742
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
For few years

743
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
You don't have an MBA you don't have formal business backpack

744
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Richmond issues how to deal with how to pay people with battery

745
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Price

746
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
It's a I think you make it sound more sophisticated than it is

747
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
All you needed to know

748
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Is

749
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
How to work with

750
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,136
And that's how the business ever is all the work I do today

751
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
It rests entirely any successor

752
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Failure rests entirely on my ability

753
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
To work with the people at hand

754
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
So learning how to recruit people

755
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
I learned

756
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
How to recruit

757
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,544
Because I made friends with every store clerk every waitress every stewardess everyone I ever met I made

758
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Friends with cuz I'm very friendly

759
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
And if I saw a spark in them

760
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,760
Which Wich said to me sales personality I would say have you ever considered doing real estate sales I recruited

761
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Everywhere

762
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Everywhere I went I recruited

763
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,416
And from what I understand you yourself actually didn't go out

764
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
How many minutes

765
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
Isil

766
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
I sold the engineers first house yet

767
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
And then from Merrill Lynch I Got a referral of David

768
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
Palmer was a really big wig and I sold him

769
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Chew apartment side-by-side

770
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Eight on the Upper East Side and East 89th

771
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Condominiums

772
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,176
And that was it that was that you didn't sell any

773
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,064
Property I guess you recognize that your talent was not

774
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
In

775
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Selling property but in

776
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Managing people

777
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
No I was great at renting apartments

778
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
However

779
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
I realize

780
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
But if I reach continue to sell because it's time-consuming to be

781
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Great salesperson

782
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
I'm very time-consuming

783
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,704
I realize that if I were to continue doing that

784
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
I could only Bill my business on the side and I just took a leap of

785
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
Faith especially when I sold David Palmer

786
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,384
2 Apartments side by side

787
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
For total value of

788
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,992
Little bit more than 350,000 which today would be

789
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
The Killing of Satan

790
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
How is a landslide

791
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
I took that check I remember collecting it from the developer and 89th Street and walking it to 60th Street in my office was skip

792
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Skipping down Madison Avenue

793
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
And seeing Georgie

794
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
To myself

795
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
I quit that Day sales

796
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
And I decided to use that money to hire

797
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Three new cells

798
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,288
Right there I knew I could afford it and then I heard six more and then 10 more

799
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,128
And then before you knew we had a thousand people I don't want to make it sound like it's overnight

800
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,456
But it was just that same methodology whenever I had spare money

801
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
I would / an overhead monthly

802
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
Figure out how many bodies I could

803
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
Afford like a mother paying for the

804
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
Kids and then I would go out and hire that many

805
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
That's it was a symbol for I never changed it was really very useful

806
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Yeah I'm wondering

807
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Let me sounds like

808
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,632
In the first years there was no

809
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
Pirate success but I mean in a short period Of time you must have hit

810
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
That the

811
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
27

812
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Read message

813
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Huge

814
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
That was a bloodbath

815
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
For a good reason

816
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,296
When the economy crashes or even really waivers

817
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
Is a terrible thing happens if you're in the real estate brokerage

818
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Is this

819
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Buyers and sellers

820
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Do nothing

821
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Nothing is terrible for brokerage

822
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,304
A big sellers Market is great cuz action

823
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Horrible Market is great

824
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
You'll have to sell

825
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,520
But in the beginning when nothing happens you go out of business well what happened was the great majority of my competitors were

826
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,640
The band used to that is it's hard to stay this is a very good news in that

827
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Is I realize

828
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
I lost half

829
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
That's a motive

830
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
What happened to you guys

831
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Oh well

832
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
I was really on the brink

833
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Declaring that it was over

834
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
But I was ashamed and trying to make back the money I owed

835
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,816
To various suppliers like my Ad Agency the New York Times

836
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
But I owed over $300,000

837
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
And there was no business coming in

838
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
There's No Business know when the market stops

839
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
Like the silence yeah it's a terrible terrible the end

840
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
You have to remember you have sales people

841
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
How many of them

842
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Supporting the family

843
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Who have no money coming that's the worst

844
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Never mind the business

845
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Lots of pressure on

846
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Did you have to let people go

847
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Oh my gosh

848
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
I always let people go anyway

849
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,000
But it was interesting I have my mother working for me then

850
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
For two years of my life

851
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
Because all of her kids are grown and she's working at the 5 and 10

852
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,728
On 215th Street walking across the George Washington Bridge and she's getting older

853
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Send Mommy can't do that you got to come over

854
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
She said she was delighted

855
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
So she was a file Clerk

856
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Boy did she keep

857
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Color coded

858
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
She was a

859
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
A genius at that

860
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
But anyway when the shit hits the fan

861
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Which is what my mother always

862
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
By the way I get it from her my filthy mouth

863
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
She came to me

864
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
And she knew I had a fire log

865
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Black people

866
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
You can just see that

867
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Everybody knew something

868
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
She got it was fast and she said

869
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
One should probably fire me if you

870
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Fire me

871
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
She said no one else could be angry with you

872
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
When you fire them and she was right

873
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,640
So at that Monday morning meeting we always had at 9:30 I said

874
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,248
You know I forgot it's no cuz I was surprised how bad things are going to have to make a lot of changes

875
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,112
And it's going to be very hard for me to do with the hardest changeables me firing my mother

876
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
LeBron

877
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
Really close to going out of business if

878
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
If you had to make

879
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Deposition

880
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Well I was going out of

881
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
The business

882
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,520
I owe the 300 some 1000 but I came up with a great idea to sell

883
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
A burning mendix

884
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,944
Apartments and nobody wanted which is owned by Equitable insurance company he was like a big real estate

885
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,552
That's one of the he until his death about gets 10 years ago

886
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,160
He was the largest developer New York him and Larry Silverstein

887
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Apartments for rent

888
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,232
World Trade Center you know that name

889
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,120
Anyway he asked me to look at 88th Apartments scattered throughout the city and a number of properties and he said I want

890
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
Find out from you how you can sell them

891
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
I knew every broken china been in to see

892
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,664
There is a dregs of the market that is someone didn't have kitchens Okat Midstream when the market collapsed

893
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,992
So they were in a c-rated buildings

894
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Everything was wrong with it

895
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,112
Anyway I went I visit maybe 8 or 9 of the apartments

896
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Through the super is in right away

897
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,256
They were dumps they could not be so we need a market to sell my desk

898
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
We had no Market

899
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,912
So anyway I went back and I told him there was no way to sell it except the public auction

900
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Do you want to do a public auction you said it

901
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
We can't go public auction we don't want the publicity of

902
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
A failure

903
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,360
And I saw the snow with a way you can sell these

904
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,712
And I'll never forget what he said he said Barbie you're a smart girl you'll figure it out

905
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,320
And I went back and thought about it and write in my head

906
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Came

907
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,720
A memory of my mom taking like seven or eight of us however many would warn them down to

908
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,536
Toms River New Jersey watching a puppy sale with the Farmer Lane

909
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Christmas tree

910
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
For my grandpa's

911
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,448
And my mother status on the grass and watched all these fancy New Yorkers arguing over

912
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
The puppies are little Jack Russell

913
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
He's really cute

914
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,336
And anyway my mother said to us

915
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Look at all these fancy

916
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
See people do you know why they will want those puppies

917
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,784
Because Lewis was smart enough to invite them all here at the same time

918
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,856
And so that popped in my head

919
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
And I went back to Bernie mendik the next day at a time

920
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Plant

921
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Ameriprise

922
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
All the apartments alike

923
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Same price

924
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Well I pray all the one bed

925
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
Like a $10,000 difference

926
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Between

927
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,776
But somewhere on 22nd floors with Gorgeous views somewhere on the third floor with no kitchen they was so on TV

928
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,872
First-come first-served have a secret sale we're not going to advertise it

929
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
I'll not sick to my salespeople me let them bring the best customers

930
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,296
But I need you to give me two years free maintenance you're not going to unload these two years anyway

931
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:17,184
Maintenance is like a association fees monthly maintenance

932
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Erase the terrible maintenance and they had nobody thinks Beyond two years

933
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,120
And price in the mall like it's going to create hype.

934
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
And so he said okay give it a whirl

935
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
And I said we had a secret

936
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
All to myself

937
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,128
Closing the business that's how close we were both unconscionable

938
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
What pressure is a wonderful thing in life

939
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
Makes you think

940
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
And so I now to to my people as a but get there early

941
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
Don't bring too many people just a family member if you want and you're single best cuss words don't bring don't spread it around weed

942
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Don't have enough to go around

943
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
And I'm telling you a ride and 80

944
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
The first tree where we had that makeshift

945
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Office that morning at 7 a.m.

946
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
And we had a line of 60 people waiting

947
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Casitas

948
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
To see those apartments

949
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,800
And I'm chilling hour and a half later more than $1000000

950
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
And I closed it was a closing

951
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
They sign the contract

952
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,712
Is like a fire sale

953
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
People happy they got the deal of the century

954
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,856
Yeah I bet they're really happy today but not as happy as I

955
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
Was that day cuz I went from being

956
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,512
New desperation of being filthy rich in real estate

957
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Chelsea rich

958
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
You got it I went right out and I rented myself

959
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,936
Full floor at 660 Madison Avenue cuz I had the cash to do it

960
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:37,056
And it's like everything I've heard about you people say you know Barbara Has Talent wasn't

961
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
About selling homes

962
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
The marketing she was

963
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Credible

964
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
Marketer is that apps absolute

965
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,760
Italy right where did you is it just an instinct

966
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
Is it just trial-and-error is it is it just being

967
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
You know kind of Hustler

968
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
Oh no I think it has more to do with

969
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
A creativity

970
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
I saw a black and white game marketing

971
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,352
It's a the softer side of things right

972
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
It involves exaggeration

973
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Involves

974
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,008
Acumen for seeing what a storyline is or what would

975
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,800
Capture people's interest in

976
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
It definitely includes

977
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
PeopleSmart

978
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:17,248
And you know what I actually started realizing I was best when things are bad because I would go into any bed real

979
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Real estate cycle in se

980
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
Say 15 position pecking order within the industry

981
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,184
And I would come out of it nice position cuz a lot of people got knocked out

982
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
You decide

983
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
I guess in

984
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Mm mm M mm

985
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
To sell the car

986
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Get out

987
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Yes

988
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
Why did you decide to sell it and you love the game you love that

989
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
Steel energy in that

990
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
Like pressure so why did you

991
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,224
Two things happened when I had my first baby at 46 I gave birth to my son Tommy after 8 years of envy

992
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,808
That was nothing short of a miracle something I desperately wanted if I

993
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
Once I had that child

994
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
My heart chain

995
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,560
And it played out my heart everyday I was home and my grand old age nursing my son and feeling guilty about it

996
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,632
Because my kids heads at work or whisper

997
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,960
And so it took me about 4 years and then I'm

998
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
Wonderful thing happened when he

999
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,824
Astronaut were doing the Corcoran report numbers are

1000
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
Yes Esther my business

1001
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,200
We're doing the Corcoran report numbers one night because hours

1002
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,760
Because we wanted to have accurate numbers or verb

1003
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
I don't know why my first

1004
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Report had no accurate

1005
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
It was just on

1006
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,952
By then we're very respectable and making sure all their numbers are

1007
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,024
And we also did monthly

1008
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,632
Port of who control the market share on listings buses was no mls in New York

1009
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
Destihl menu

1010
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,496
Multiple listing service that showed you

1011
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
You who had what listing

1012
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
Like if you could just go to one

1013
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Place to see

1014
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
See all the listing

1015
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
No

1016
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
And we broke the market

1017
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,992
Enterprise categories in Easton Westside uptown

1018
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Downtown

1019
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
So we had those category

1020
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
And we would go through the listing

1021
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Together

1022
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
And she'd say

1023
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
575 / west side

1024
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Distraught

1025
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
How to categorize

1026
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
Buy all the top agencies in town the top set

1027
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
And then that night

1028
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,704
We did all the ad up and we could clearly see that Corcoran was no

1029
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,520
We had more listings in every category

1030
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,080
The highest to the lowest Uptown downtown east or west

1031
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
Smidgen over Brown Harris Douglas Elliman

1032
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
And I turn to ask Jonathan let's sell this Joy

1033
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Big bottle

1034
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
Also

1035
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
To be a fair

1036
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
It was the first year

1037
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
That I

1038
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
He had made over million dollar

1039
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Myself

1040
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
And I figured

1041
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
It's probably worth something

1042
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
You sold it for 66 million dollars

1043
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Because I remember being on a ski lift

1044
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,544
Is my roofer brother John who still lives in Edgewater

1045
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
We are out in Utah I think I'm going up a chair lift and I get on my cell phone call from my attorney who said I've got great news

1046
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
He said I have an offer

1047
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
20

1048
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
3 million dollars are you seated

1049
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,599
Acetone 23000000

1050
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Dollar Tree does yep

1051
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
One piece

1052
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,975
$3000000 all-cash

1053
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
And I said

1054
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,815
Great comeback when you get 66

1055
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Cash and he said

1056
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
Y 66 million

1057
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
Because it's worth it

1058
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
And I hung up

1059
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
And I said to my brother

1060
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,359
23 million think of that John Maginot 723

1061
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,711
Anyssa but why'd you say 66 at the Opus that's my lucky number

1062
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:33,599
And would you bake those that those accountant kill themselves to try to figure out why 66

1063
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
It was until the closing

1064
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,487
That's great satisfaction tell him a whole bunch of hell with my lucky number

1065
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
It was approved

1066
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
Did you want when you sold the company did you

1067
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Did you

1068
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Regret it

1069
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,639
I would have to answer that honestly on some level yes and in

1070
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
I'm more important level

1071
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
A knot

1072
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,759
I felt enormous sense of freedom

1073
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
To be a phenomenal mother

1074
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,415
And so that was exactly what I wanted and I had the enormous satisfaction

1075
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
Of knowing I had

1076
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
Become the queen of New York real estate

1077
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
And financially now

1078
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Set for life

1079
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Yes

1080
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,167
But I never understood

1081
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
How much I loved

1082
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
The people I work with and how much that

1083
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Teen meant to me

1084
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
It was my lifeblood

1085
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
I found them

1086
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
Routed them train them live with them

1087
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
Got into Good Times bad times

1088
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,015
Times ahead sales managers 11 of

1089
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
That I'd ordinator toward me we were such a tight

1090
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,879
And I felt

1091
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Happily lonely

1092
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,487
And I really thought I was going to get depressed and probably need to shrink

1093
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
Because I really didn't know what to do with myself

1094
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Yearned

1095
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,655
For good morning Barbie good morning flower good morning Barbara

1096
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,959
And all the hoopla that went

1097
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
With being somebody in a business it was

1098
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
Who's gone so that part

1099
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Adult

1100
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Baidu

1101
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
What did I do to myself

1102
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,407
Until of course I

1103
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
I don't want to say reinvented

1104
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Myself

1105
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
Starting all over again and trying to

1106
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Build a new career

1107
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
That's that's the same way

1108
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Because obviously you did

1109
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,695
Go on an envelope second career most people listening to this

1110
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:19,071
Would know you as as one of the sharks on Shark Tank not as the head of the Corcoran group

1111
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,887
Do you wait when you're on that show DUI

1112
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
It seems like you have a bias

1113
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Star people who

1114
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
You know who have someone back

1115
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
To come from now

1116
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
Money

1117
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
I'm very fine

1118
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
They have a much better shot at succeed

1119
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Why

1120
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Lottery

1121
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
The Mosasaurus

1122
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
They've never had the fancy fake

1123
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Vacation

1124
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
The delicious new car

1125
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
The

1126
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
The private schools the higher education of minions

1127
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
And they aspired to it

1128
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,815
So they get more satisfaction out of

1129
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Climbing that ladder in getting to

1130
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
End

1131
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Are they

1132
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Hasina parents struggle

1133
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,591
Through life to give them whatever they've given them the more appreciative they don't take things for granted

1134
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
And you know what else

1135
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
Which I should have started with it totally free

1136
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
From expectation

1137
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
Do you know

1138
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
How

1139
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
How lucky I was

1140
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
To never

1141
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
For a second

1142
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,951
Ever think I wonder what my parents think

1143
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
Well it was was just let's see how far I could go I had nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up to you have a friend that is to take risks so that

1144
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
Did not risk of arson

1145
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,703
And you strive

1146
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,335
So I really am biased I'm not saying that you can succeed I mean God willing I have

1147
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
I have privilege children

1148
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Can I hope they'll succeed

1149
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
It's much harder for me

1150
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
Not to let them feel my success even if I don't say a word

1151
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
And so they're not as free as I was you know God bless them

1152
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Thomas Hardy

1153
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,999
Keith deal I mean when you were a kid you were told that you are smart

1154
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
Do you feel now

1155
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
But you've convinced yourself that you are far

1156
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Well yes or no

1157
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
I'm certainly Street Smart

1158
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
I'm certainly

1159
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
PeopleSmart

1160
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
I have

1161
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Instinct

1162
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
When trouble is brewing

1163
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Where's the best accountants in the world way to the wall

1164
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Should I trust my math instinct

1165
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,271
I think I'm a smart person for sure

1166
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
More than that

1167
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
I think I'm going to normalcy hard-working

1168
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
And I have great Confidence from my ability to work

1169
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
Hard to do anything

1170
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
And I think I'm very good

1171
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
At not feeling sorry for

1172
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
And I think that's a boy

1173
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
How much of your of your success do you think

1174
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
Is is because of

1175
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Just

1176
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
Skill intelligent hard-working and how much it is luck

1177
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Well I do believe in luck I've had many

1178
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
Many many lucky

1179
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
Brakes including meeting Ramon at the diner then

1180
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah or the very good luck of having my parents as parents

1181
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
Not bad right

1182
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Once you grow up

1183
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
Are you make your own

1184
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
Definitely make

1185
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,839
I think all the lucky breaks I had were more result in me staying in the game

1186
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
I just believing something would break

1187
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Just hanging around

1188
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
That's more important than luck in my

1189
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,031
Being aggressive at every opportunity

1190
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,103
And standing up for yourself yes more important than

1191
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
Barbara Corcoran by the way she was in

1192
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
Initially rejected for a spot on Shark Tank

1193
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
They went with a younger woman

1194
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,439
To Barbara wrote a letter to the producer

1195
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
I said

1196
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,791
I consider your rejection a lucky charm

1197
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
Because everything that ever happened in my life

1198
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
Came on the heels of failure

1199
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
The next day

1200
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
He called her

1201
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
Said he reconsidered and

1202
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335

1221
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

1222
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
I know for how you

1223
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Who built that

1224
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
And this one comes from Arielle Rivera he lives in Weston Florida and about 10 years ago are y'all found himself

1225
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:40,191
Scrambling at the last minute to buy something thoughtful for his girlfriend's birthday

1226
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,823
Well that's very good foods just I think like a box of chocolate just some random get that I'd given her

1227
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,223
So a box of chocolates not super creative right but are y'all actually is creative infected

1228
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
Designer so you thought maybe I'll at least do something cool with the wrapping paper I think I had my picture just

1229
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
On my computer

1230
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,303
And I just flipped out the head really quick and I I decided to just repeater on a piece of paper with a funny background

1231
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
So he duplicated his face

1232
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,447
15 times and then he Photoshop them onto a backdrop

1233
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:18,847
Like a Cheesy yellow Starburst pattern design onto plain paper

1234
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,943
Wrap the chocolate and then he handed the gift to his girlfriend Vanessa and

1235
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,343
Reaction oh my God this is hilarious what did you do and why is your face on this

1236
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
It was so funny and clearly it worked because it's three years later Vanessa and Arielle.

1237
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,095
She also happens to be a graphic designer and now again

1238
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,143
They would do the same thing that would make

1239
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,959
Wrapping paper for friends and family and put

1240
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Their faces on it

1241
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,823
And just about every time we give to somebody that I used to start a business out of this you should

1242
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
You should make a website you should make website

1243
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
So eventually

1244
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
Ariel and Vanessa did

1245
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Just that

1246
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:59,295
And at first it was it was tough because we are not web designer

1247
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
Tina I mean now I guess we are

1248
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:08,511
But after some trial-and-error they started the website and then they named their business giftwrapmyface so

1249
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
You upload a photo

1250
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
They duplicated and print dozens of your tiny little faces onto whatever image you choose we have

1251
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Have the statue of David

1252
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,799
The Mona Lisa the cupid

1253
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,407
Bride and groom we have Vanessa launched a few years ago

1254
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,455
I got a few hundred orders at first

1255
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
And about a year-and-a-half later

1256
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,575
Oprah featured the wrapping paper in her magazine

1257
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,951
When you finally hitting BC over holding our paper in the I think she was in her kitchen holding up

1258
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,279
A box that's wrapped in our paper which I know that I printed for her

1259
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
It was wild

1260
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
It was really wild

1261
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,887
And thanks in part to Oprah

1262
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,983
Arielle and Vanessa sold about 5000 orders of wrapping paper last

1263
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
You're not enough to pay

1264
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
Pay themselves just yet

1265
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,871
So they're still keeping their day jobs as graphic designers

1266
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,503
Right now they've got two printers they're still working out of the garage and also

1267
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
Raising two kids

1268
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,391
So it's either talking about the business or talk about the kids
