My favorite quotes is if you want to understand and study the juvenile delinquent

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
Cuz it's cuz they're saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way and that's what they all say

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
They just say this is wrong I'm going to do it this other way and that's the fun part of business actually

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680

00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
How far from pounding hot metal in a converted Chicken Coop to sounding the outdoor

13
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,376
He says he does not want

00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Got your money

15

16
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
Snappy elevator pitch

17
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,856
He's basically a surfer a kayaker in a mountain climber who sort of stumbled into the role of businessman

18
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
So pretty

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
How can I say this

20
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Eccentric

21
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
In the best possible way

22
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
If I never had any interest

23
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
Becoming rich

Actively work to slow down patagonia's growth in

Profit margin

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,776
Despite his best efforts to keep it small

27
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
This little clothing company he started 50 years ago

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
Has turned into a huge business

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Well I never intended this

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
It's just

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
I just have this

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Snack that every time I look at

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Product guide

34
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
I look at it nice

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
You know I can

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
It could be better

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
So every time we went climbing

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
We come back with ideas on how to improve the climbing gear which is very crude enough

39
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
And so

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
You know I became a blacksmith

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,520
I've taught myself blacksmithing so that I could make

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Some of the

43
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,664
Climbing Hardware that I thought would be better than what's available you're literally like pounding

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Hot pictures of metal into shape

45
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
That's exactly right you don't do nothing

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Parents backyard then my father

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Help me convert a chicken coop into it

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Hello shop

49
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Well as making the anal pitons metal spikes that you pound in the cracks and I was making the Caribbean

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Snap blankson

51
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Target

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
Yeah cuz I mean at that time mountain climbing was still

53
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,336
It wasn't a huge commercial Enterprise

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
No they were probably

55
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
250

56
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
The climbers in the country cow

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Yeah

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
And all the gear came from Europe in and it was pretty poor quality

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Like the pitons were made to be used once

60
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
Because Europeans looks at

61
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Climbing

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Conquering mountains

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,816
And you just leave all the gear in place to make it easier for the next group

64
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
And we were brought up

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Another philosophy of John Muir and

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
And also throwing

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800
We felt like nature should be left alone and

68
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
You should do a climate but leave nothing behind

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,944
And so I made pitons out of better materials

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Put in and take it out

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
And used over already

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
It was a lesson in

73
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
And quality I think because

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
Dear P&P towns were selling for

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
$0.15

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
What's a piece

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And mine word dollar and a half

78
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
And I guess you just for like 10 or 10 or so years

79
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah

80
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Were you doing well

81
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
Well yeah we had 80

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Percent of the market

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
And anyway I guess you had no intention of ever making it that right

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,128
No not at all right I didn't respect businessman I had no interest

85
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Business whatsoever I was a Craftsman

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
But you know we were making

87
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
Are they any money

88
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
We're making about 1%

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Prophet the end of the year we're basically paying ourselves

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
By the hour so how did you guys Branch out from

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
From climbing gear to clothing

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,583
Well I was on a climbing trip to Scotland in the winter

93
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,935
I was walking by some shop and I saw a rugby shirt in the window

94
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
Watch pretty cool so you know as real colorful head

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Blue and red and yellow

96
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Made really tough

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
So I thought this make a really great shirt

98
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Climbing

99
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
You know the caller

100
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,807
Can I keep the gear slings from cutting your neck and you know at that time

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Active Sportswear for men

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Was basically Gray

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Sweatshirts and sweatpants

104
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
That was it. Men did not wear either

105
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Colorful

106
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
And so I started wearing this

107
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Climbing and everybody was going wow

108
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Where'd you get that

109
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
So it's kind of Lights came on I thought well maybe out of

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Import a few these from England

111
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
And see if she'll sell and sure enough they sold

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
And then I started making some climbing shorts

113
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Pantsing

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
One thing led to another and I realized

115
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
More profitable than making

116
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Pitons

117
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
How did you come up with the name Patagonia

118
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Well in 68 I did

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
6 month long trip

120
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
From California down to

121
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
South America

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
We drove

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
What time does surf don't let me down

124
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Jocose

125
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,751
Downtown Lima and then sold a surfboards and then climb volcanoes down at southern Chile and

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Skeet off of Ammon

127
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
I kind of fell in love with that area

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Patagonia

129
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
You know on those days nobody even knew what

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Patagonia watch

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Kauai

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Timbuktu

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
You know how many people know where

134
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Timbuktu

135
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
And so I decided to call it Patagonia because

136
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
I wanted to make clothing for those kind of conditions

137
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Cape Horn

138
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
Like super high winds cold

139
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
Crazy temperatures change in weather exactly

140
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Is it is it like

141
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
You did not know anything about clothing

142
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
Here right I didn't know anything about closing I learned everything by

143
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
If I get an idea immediately take a step 4

144
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
And see how that feels if it feels good I take another step

145
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
I feel bad I step

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,135
You know it's different than people with a scientific view or they

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
Take everything out to the Instagram before they make a move

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
So I I learn by just doing

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Either one of the first products we made it was a pair of climbing shorts and

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
I made the pattern for it

151
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
I knew nothing about powder make I just took a pair of

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
Shorts apart and I kind of looked at it and I

153
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
And I wanted you to make a really tough pair of shorts so I use

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Canvas from

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Outdoor furniture

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Palace Korean woman

157
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,367
Working for me and she had to show it on a walking foot machine which is the kind of sewing machine.

158
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Used for

159
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
Sewing leather cuz

160
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Fabric was so II

161
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,839
And when she was done with him she stood him up he stood straight up

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,239
So we need them stand up shorts and you know it took about 50 Washington to break him in but

163
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
We still make those shorts but

164
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Of course not is the heaviest

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
They were

166
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
It seems like

167
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Your

168
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,759
Main motivation was to just make stuff that you would want to wear and use yourself but love

169
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Nobody's making stuff good enough

170
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
And you were just sort of like I guess I have to break it

171
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,719
Yeah you know I I I used to do every

172
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Conceivable sport

173
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,583
And then the people that work for me where all sports

174
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Also we knew

175
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
What we wanted

176
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
You know what I heard somebody say that

177
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
You wait for the customer to tell you what to do you're too late

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
So we were our own cuss

179
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
And I think that was a secret

180
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Coming out with products

181
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
A lot of products people didn't even know they

182
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
They want it or need it

183
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
When you start to do this

184
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,135
And you have to hire employees and you have to form a company and you had to

185
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
Deal with payroll like the back start to scare you

186
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Oh yeah

187
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Yeah that was pretty scary and we made a lot of mistakes

188
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
And in fact we were so successful in the

189
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Ladies

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
We were growing too fast we're going to 50

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
80% of here

192
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
And now you can't do that for very long before you

193
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Run out of money basically

194
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
On retainer nanjing

195
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
And so we were also

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Ramped up to Griffith

197
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
80% and we only grew

198
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
25 hours

199
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
Which doesn't sound bad but when you build all the inventory for

200
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Her that

201
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
You don't make it

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,167
It's pretty rough and then there was a recession down and and the banks wouldn't give us any more money in fact

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
I had to lay people off with

204
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Was really hard because we're

205
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Family

206
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Style business

207
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
I knew everybody working there

208
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
That was really tough

209
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
DJ moments

210
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
During those periods

211
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
The ups and downs where you thought

212
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Patagonia might fail

213
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Oh absolutely

214
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
We didn't know where they were going to make it or not we couldn't get any loans from anybody

215
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
My accountant

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
Introduce me to some Mafia guys who understand me

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Some money at 18%

218
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Interest

219
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Which I turned down but

220
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
What day does this is we got some personal loans from

221
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
Some friends and pretty much

222
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,919
Fired some management that got us into this problem and turn things around

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
Why do you think it happened was it just bad luck was it

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
The economy or was it

225
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Wizz Air

226
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
A strategy that didn't align with

227
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
We were just going for girls

228
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
You know not saying no

229
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
It's just

230
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Broski

231
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,887
Creep up on you I mean we were just opening more more dealers or Opening Our Own retail stores

232
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
You know nothing goes forever

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,287
And the fact that's why the faster a business grows the faster it dies

234
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
And so once we got out of this we decided to

235
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Put ourselves on a

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Growth

237
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Program so that

238
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
We would be in business a hundred years

239
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
So all decisions

240
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Then on were made as if we're going to be here a hundred years

241
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
So what

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Slowing down the girl saying no

243
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
2

244
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
A lot of opportunities

245
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
And just

246
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Being more responsive

247
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Like like how

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
It just

249
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,471
I don't prime the pump I don't we don't advertise it

250
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
Vanity Fair to get new Custer

251
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Affect our advertising budget

252
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
1/2 of 1%

253
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Auto Sales

254
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
And so

255
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
I wait for the customer to tell us

256
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
How much to make

257
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
When year will grow 3%

258
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
Another year will grow 20%

259
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
It's not this

260
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,535
Smooth curve like public companies who have to grow 15% exactly every single year or else their stock

261
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
And all those two kinds of growth one

262
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Where you grow stronger and when you grow fat

263
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Anna

264
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
You got to look out for that growing fat thing

265
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
Imagine art when we come back how he slow growth by telling his employees

266
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Go surfing

267
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719

291
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807

00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
TED Radio Hour

295
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
It's how I built this from NPR

296
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Gyros

297
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,495
Took that tough. In the early 1990s

298
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847
Avon and his team started to focus Less on growing and more

299
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Lasting is

300
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
The company

301
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
And it's hard to do things like

302
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
Use more environmentally friendly material

303
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
And they also started to do something

304
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Weird for

305
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
A business

306
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Instead of telling customers to

307
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
To buy their stuff

308
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Patagonia kind of told them

309
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Not to

310
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Yeah

311
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Believe

312
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
This company is the resource

313
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
That I have

314
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
And that I should use that resource

315
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
To show a different way of doing business

316
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
In fact we now have the largest

317
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Garmin repair center in North America

318
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,175
Well Repair every single piece of Patagonia matter how old it is

319
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
Then definitely in fact we've got a truck.

320
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
It's going around the country

321
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
Repairing people's clothes no matter whether they're Patagonia or not

322
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
And then we're trying to teach people that

323
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
You don't throw things away you you repair them

324
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
And then we weave

325
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Committed ourselves to owning

326
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
The product forever

327
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
So when we sell you a jacket

328
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
We still on it

329
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
If you get overweight already

330
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Tired of the color whatever you want to get rid of it will help you

331
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Sell it to somebody else

332
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
If breaks down will fix it

333
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
The f is finally you know completely shot

334
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
You give it back to us and we'll recycle it into

335
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Morgan

336
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,671
So it forces us to use

337
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
Fibers that can be recycled

338
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
It forces us to

339
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Design

340
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,375
See a jacket that you can replace a zipper cuz it's very easy to

341
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Design one where you can't replace a zipper

342
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Is change the whole way we do business

343
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
Yeah so like what about you how many how many Patagonia

344
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
He be surprised at all my stuff is

345
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
Years and years old I'm sitting here talking to you my pants

346
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
Probably seven or eight years old my shirt design

347
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Probably the same

348
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
But you know it's it's kind of interesting

349
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Friend of mine went to

350
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
Garage sales Jackson Hole recent

351
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,327
And there was a jacket that we made about 10 years ago and it was purple man

352
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Great shape

353
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
The woman wanted

354
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
$3

355
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
So you offer 15 sheet

356
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Any win on eBay

357
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Anna guy from Japan said hey

358
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
I like to buy that jacket how much you want for it all

359
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
You don't make me an offer

360
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Tulalip how about 750

361
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
So actually

362
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Distance keep their value

363
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,463
Which is pretty amazing and I mean this thing is like a new Patagonia jacket is not exactly

364
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Cheap stuff

365
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Well yeah I mean we have a

366
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,399
Lifetime guarantee and we can't make things cheaply

367
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
I'm for trying to make

368
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
The very very highest quality weed

369
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
We can end it

370
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,103
You know it's like organic food is cost more than regular food

371
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
As a truth

372
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
And it causes you no less harm the environment and so

373
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,527
Black people pay for that and I'm not interested in

374
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
And coming out with a line of

375
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Inexpensive clothes

376
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
You know it's kind of like eating meat

377
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
I eat meat but I eat

378
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
Tiny little bit at a time I don't either

379
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
16 oz porterhouse

380
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
And I think

381
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Was clothing we're telling people looks think twice

382
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,007
If you're going to buy a jack at the skin by one that you can also wear over your

383
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
Sukkot in New York City in a rainstorm

384
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
So that doesn't sit in the closet 9 months a year and and so on own few or things but really good

385
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
What is

386
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,623
Is a party still conflicted over this idea that even with all the

387
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Responsible things you do

388
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Uart

389
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Still part of

390
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Consumer world

391
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Yeah

392
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
We certainly are ya

393
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
And that's why we try to

394
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
Kind of put a spin on it by

395
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Don't tell me our customers

396
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Twice

397
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Before they buy

398
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Anything

399
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Not just our product but anything

400
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
You have

401
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
No

402
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,711
College degree your meat of a business degree you're not

403
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
Like you are not a businessman

404
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
But you are you became one

405
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,159
A never bread that you can call yourself a reluctant businessman

406
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
But do you feel uncomfortable with that title

407
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
No not at all because I think

408
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
What I did

409
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Is once I decided that was it

410
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Decided to really study up on it

411
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
I studied every book I could on

412
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Japanese

413
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Management styles

414
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Scandinavian

415
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Businesses

416
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Cuz I thought there had to be a different way of doing business

417
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
And

418
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
I still wanted only work

419
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
For part of the Year myself

420
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
You know what I take off from

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
June until November

422
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm gone I got a place in Jackson Hole when I go fishing every day and

423
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
I calling maybe three times

424
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
In the five months

425
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Lambcon

426
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
People know that if the warehouse burns down

427
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Don't call me

428
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
What can I do you know what to do

429
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
How are you going to do that

430
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
Well you know I heard a great thing on NPR X

431
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Swimming at Stanford

432
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Studies ants

433
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
She said

434
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
You know ant colonies don't have

435
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
They don't have bosses

436
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,671
And everyone knows what their job is and they get their job done and

437
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
Compare that with dictatorship

438
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,559
It's a lot of companies are top-down management and it takes a

439
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
Tremendous amount of effort to run those

440
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
So what we decided to do is just higher

441
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
Motivated young independent people

442
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
And leave me alone

443
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
Nme night I wrote a book called

444
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,479
Let my people go surfing and it's all about we have a policy that when the surf comes up

445
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Drop or can you go surfing

446
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
I don't care when you work

447
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
As long as the job gets done

448
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
And now you know I've had other companies

449
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
Come to me and say oh I love that idea are they going to do tonight

450
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Comprehensive

451
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Forget it you'll fail

452
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Because you have to start with a very first person you hire

453
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
And I've had

454
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Psychologist

455
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Studier

456
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
Her employees and they said I got to tell you

457
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
Your employees are the most independent ever seen any company in fact they're so independent unemployable anywhere

458
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
About the company

459
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
In the seventies you guys were doing

460
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Maternal and paternal leave

461
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,327
People taking their infant to daycare for the staff and will flexible work schedule of the things that we

462
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Even to this day today are still

463
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
Not that common in in all companies

464
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
YouTube

465
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
40 years ago

466
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
Oh yeah I mean

467
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
We wanted ever kids with us at work

468
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
Do you know who put them in a cardboard box on your desk in

469
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
And that work for a while but then

470
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Got some Screamers

471
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
And so my wife and I started

472
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
And we didn't want to just

473
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Somebody just babysitting these kids

474
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
You know we recognize it

475
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
025 is the most important

476
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Learning time of

477
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Person's life

478
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
And so it's

479
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Not a babysitting service

480
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
The kids are come out of our company or the best product

481
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
It comes out

482
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
Not once been in prison yet

483
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Always things

484
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Costco

485
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
The company

486
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Money

487
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Well if we're going to be here a hundred years so you know it's

488
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,487
We're not going to sell out we're not going to go public and so

489
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
It's good business

490
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
I mean I have

491
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Probably 70% women work

492
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,911
For me I have women and all upper management

493
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
And I don't want to lose him

494
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Where did you

495
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
I mean a lot of the people that we talked to on the show are motivated by

496
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
In a wine to change an industry

497
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
Or change the way business is done

498
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Or to change the world or two

499
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Make money

500
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,111
Nevermind I think everybody would agree that they wanted to make money

501
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
Isn't you where did you and where do you find the motivation to

502
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
This company

503
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Ryman Frey

504
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
Well you know where my favorite quotes is

505
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
If you want to understand that entrepreneurial studies of juvenile

506
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,311
Cuz they're saying you know this sucks I'm going to do it my own way

507
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
I

508
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Have a background

509
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
As always the shortest guy around I could play

510
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Sports pretty well you know team sports but

511
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
When it came time for a

512
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
Actual game mode fumble the ball

513
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
I realize that

514
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,280
The best thing to do is invent your own sports then you can always be a winner and so

515
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,144
That's what the entrepreneur. They just say this is wrong I'm going to do it this other way

516
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
If you want to be successful in business

517
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
You don't go up against Coca-Cola

518
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
These big companies are they'll kill you

519
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
You just do it differently

520
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
You figure out something that no one else has thought about

521
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
And you do it at totally different way and so

522
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Breaking the rules

523
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
You have to be creative

524
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
And that's the fun part of this

525
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
I love breaking the rules

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,608
You still must live by it by certain rules

527
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
I cannot guide you

528
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Well I've been a student at kind of sand Buddhism

529
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
What's my life

530
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
I believe in you.

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
The more you know the less you need

532
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
I've been fishing

533
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Fly fishing with one fly

534
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
The one taipei

535
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Butterfly in different sizes

536
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
It has limited myself to that

537
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
For a whole year

538
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
And I caught more fish than I've ever caught in my

539
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
I realize that all of these

540
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
Hundreds of thousands of different fly patterns

541
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Colors

542
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Shapes and everything

543
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
You can replace all of that

544
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
With

545
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Knowledge

546
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
And

547
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Technique

548
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
And it's a good lesson for me

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,336
Detroit historic saying the world it's a simplify your life

550
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
Cuz everything pulls you to be more and more comfy

551
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
And so

552
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
I think what I learned from

553
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Fly fishing

554
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
Is that if we have to

555
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,136

He never took a penny of investment by the way salons 100% of the company

560
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,384
And because of that the company doesn't make the numbers public soap

561
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,224
Despite the fact that endless growth may not be Yvonne chenard sing

562

574

578

Stateline

579
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Nevada

580
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:38,400
Hi my name is Cassie Burnside and I'm the owner and founder of fatco yep

581
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
Costco

582
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,520
Why would anybody want to put the word fat into the name of their startup

583
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
Will you still back a bit because about 4 years ago

584
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,128
Cassie started to notice something that

585
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
Can a bugger I would go shopping and I would look at labels and look at ingredient panels

586
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
And not be able to read or pronounce anything

587
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
I had no idea what these ingredients were and she was bothered by products that go directly onto your

588
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,352
Skin like deodorant lotions and creams but then she thought

589
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,192
Maybe I can make some of those things myself and use you know

590
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
Old fashioned ingredients

591
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
Ingredients that we used a long time ago

592
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
In soap making and candle making and I started wondering like why don't we use them anymore why

593
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Those things go away

594
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
And here is where

595
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Fat comes in

596
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Because Cassie realize that

597
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,208
Animal fat is used to be a main ingredient in things like soap and lotions

598
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
And so she decided

599
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Why not make skin products with

600
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Beef tallow

601
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
The fat from a cow

602
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
Chop it up and you cook it low and slow

603
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
And rendered Tallow is the liquid fat that drips off of the card fat during that rendering process

604
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
Just to be clear Cassie does not do this at home she gets her towel from a company in Colorado that special

605
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
Socializes in rendered fat

606
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:04,160
And then she mixes the fat with other oils and fragrances to make things like body butter and lotion

607
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,232
They're nursing their nutrient dense

608
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,376
They're very concentrated and a little goes a long way cuz he actually took a big risk but two years ago when she

609
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
Twitter engineering job to start backhoe

610
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,568
The last year she made close to $700,000 selling her products online

611
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,688
And she says all the friends and family who told her this would never work this is crazy and weird

612
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
They're not saying that anymore

613
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
I can't lie even my mom told me I was a little crazy

614
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,440
And now she's you know she's our biggest fan she will go to her grave saying she was customer one for fatco
