It's Thanksgiving week and at some point some of you might be killing time in a long line at the grocery store

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,160
We figured it was the perfect moment to rerun the story of how

00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208

Going to be posting another interview from the how I built this Summit in San Francisco

22
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312

23
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan

24
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Method

25
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
We talking about

26
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Chemistry

Partnerships

28
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Okay

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Here's the show

30
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
Venture capitalist for like hitchhiker's with credit cards and Islam

31
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Long as you take them to where they want to go they will help you pay for the gas but if you don't take them

32
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Where they want to go they will try to hijack the car and throw you out on the side of the road so I did

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Did not trust Avicii's I like them I didn't trust him I did not want him to take control of the company so I thought no going to go public

34
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
And then we're going to get The Hitchhikers out of the car

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
From NPR how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists story

36
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Behind the movement

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
A vegetarian inspired John Mackey to start

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,104
An organic food Revolution change the way Americans

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Shop for groceries

40
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
If you happen to step into an

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
Organic food Co-Op in the 60s

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
70s

43
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
You would probably walk past

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Isles

45
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Isles of

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,024
Bulk bins full of beans and brown rice

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Send dried fruit

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
There were no big Brands nose

49
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Stonyfield Farms

50
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,704
Nature's Path Amy's or Annies

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
And the people who shot the me stores

52
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
They were money

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Teeny tiny handful of Americans

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Who even knew what

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Keno or

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Taylor

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
And they were mostly counterculture types

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
Hippies Back To Nature folks

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Mom

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
And yet all these people were at the Leading Edge of a food Revolution

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
That would start to sweep the country

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
In the 1990s

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
And that Revolution was

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Largely propelled

65
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
Even though that company inspires

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Pretty strong opinion

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Fanboys

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Damn haters

69
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
There's no denying that

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
It had a monster-sized impact on

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
The way we eat

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
But the person who is

73
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
Partly responsible for this revolution

74
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Well

75
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Here's what John Mackey grew up eating

76
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Irestore

77
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Today with

78
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Cocoa Puffs

79
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880

Pop-Tarts

81
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
Very picky eater as well so hamburgers

82
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
For lunch with nothing on it from no vegetables on the hamburgers

83
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,144
Maybe fried chicken for dinner or macaroni and cheese out of a

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Can or box

85
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
This was the era where

86
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Stay-at-home moms were so thrilled about the

87
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Great innovations that could happen like

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
TV dinners

89
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Frozen TV dinners that you could

91
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
Pop in the oven and

92
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Value.

93
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
Meal for your family

94
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
Where were you in life

95
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
When you first

96
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Discovered

97
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Food

98
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Like real

99
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Yeah my food

100
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Consciousness Awakening

101
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Really

102
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Heard when I was about

103
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
23

104
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
And I moved into this vegetarian Co-op

105
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Austin

106
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Call Prana house

107
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
I was definitely interested in the counterculture

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
I'm about I meet interesting women as well I thought it was a

109
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Amazon adventure

110
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
I've expanded my

111
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368
Diet from inside to become a vegetarian that I became the food buyer for that Co-op

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
And

113
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Then I had to get a job when I went to work for a small nap

114
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
Whole Food store in Austin called The Good Food Company

115
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
And wow

116
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
I'd like I was launched on my path I

117
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
I love everything about natural organic foods

118
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
I like cooking

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
I like retailing it

120
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
And I thought this is something I could really

121
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Be passionate about

122
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,735
Okay at this point in your life you did not like you didn't have a college degree Riley

123
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Kind of dropped out of college

124
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
So when I was about 20 years old

125
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,487
I was on track to get a degree in Philosophy from the University of Texas

126
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
But I ran into a course that was required course I needed

127
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
To complete

128
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,727
Didn't like the course I didn't like the books that I was required to read I didn't like

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,055
Professor and then one day the battle is over

130
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
And I

131
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,455
Stood up and the book I was reading or trying to read I threw it on the ground if I'm not going to read this book

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
Then I just began to read books and take horses that I was interested in

133
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
So I ended up with 120 hours of electives that were just courses I was interested in but

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
I took control of my life I began to be authentic and true to myself and that led me into this hole

135
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Napa Fish World so when you show up into this

136
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Drama college

137
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Degree

138
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
I'm assuming it's kind of like a hippie

139
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Typo

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Play playlist definitely

141
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Your parents are super excited at with the decisions you've made at this point your life at 23

142
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
No my parents were

143
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Very worried

144
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Very unhappy

145
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
The very last conversation I ever had in my mother 1987

146
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,399
Was on her deathbed and she asked me to go back to school and make something of myself

147
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
I was

148
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Grocer I was a hippy grocer

149
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
And I

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
She said anyway you have a fine mind John why are you wasting it is a gross or goats

151
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
The doctor a lawyer do something with your life

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Makes a difference and I said

153
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
I'm doing something in my life that makes a difference

154
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
She said you're just a grocer

155
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879
Mom grocery store great

156
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
What was it like like what

157
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
What was it like working at that Health Foods

158
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
I loved it I mean it

159
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Store wasn't very big with only a couple thousand

160
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Squishy butt

161
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,471
The retail business was really fun I mean first on surrounded by food which I'm fascinated

162
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
Buy with other people and I'm working with the other

163
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
7 relatives working to the store and

164
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
They're also equally interested in food

165
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
There people that you get to no overtime and a small store with not in about that many customers so you develop relationships with

166
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
People and you serve them and I just thought that was like super funny new

167
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
I can do this to sink within my realm of competence and then I work for about 6 months and when I

168
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
Summa an idea grew in my mind which is this is what I want to do with my life I want to open I want to open my own store

169
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
Went back to the coop and talk to my girlfriend Renee she was four years younger than me so I think I was like 23 and she was like

170
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
119 and she got super excited about it I've often wondered if Rene had so that's a stupid idea to never work how my life might be

171
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
Different now but she was very excited about it and we began to plot out opening around store

172
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
How did you eat

173
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Maven get started

174
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Well

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
That wasn't easy

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
I make a joke about it now that

177
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,407
And entrepreneurs a little bit like a panhandler

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Except

179
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
That they're selling dreams

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,087
The people we raise the money because we like most entrepreneurs friends and family

181
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
We thought we needed $50,000

182
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Start the store

183
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
And

184
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
We can only come up with 45 but we decided we can make do with it

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
And

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
My initial stake

187
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
$10,000

188
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
What's the most

189
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Iavarone to the company

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
And 10 of the $45,000 I borrowed all that

191
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
My father

192
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
So with that money you were able to open up

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
That the first Whole Foods

194
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Well

195
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
Original story called safer way

196
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Thanks Safeway but safer away

197
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
And are we truthfully we are always hoping that

198
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Maybe

199
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Safeway would sue us

200
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
Are you good publicity

201
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
And

202
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
Although selective I had in school none of them were business class

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
No real

204
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Business

205
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Strength Renee didn't have any experience she was

206
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Can we open the store she was

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
2021

208
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
And

209
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,127
Wilton we open a store in an old house not even on busy road it was just

210
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Like

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
We just thought this was a super cool house

212
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
So we

213
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
We had a

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Store on the first floor vegetarian storm

215
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
And we are vegetarian restaurant on the 2nd

216
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Flora caffe

217
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
And then we have an office and we lived on the on the third floor

218
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
If you if you were to walk through safer

219
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
Play What Would you see on the shelves is it like bulk

220
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
Products in light jeans and was there sugar

221
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Sure we didn't sell sugar

222
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
We didn't sell meat

223
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
We were selling real foods we were selling bulk foods

224
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
And produce

225
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
And yes definitely everybody was a hippie

226
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
But we had about

227
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
Counting the people in the cafes a lot of new Morgan talk part time

228
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
20 people work at 15 to 20 people

229
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
So were you scared I mean you were you were still a kid

230
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
No

231
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
I wasn't scared at all you thought this was going to work

232
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
When your

233
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
You can when you're 24 25 years old

234
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
You don't have so much to lose I wasn't married I didn't have any

235
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Kids II

236
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
For my case the worst case scenario was

237
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
I would disappoint a lot of people

238
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
And

239
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
I do something else in life

240
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
I didn't

241
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
For me was a grand Adventure

242
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Starting businesses

243
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Fun

244
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
Fun because you're you're you're engaged and you're

245
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
You're passionate about it and

246
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
The whole

247
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Dream just would have swept us along

248
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
And we didn't know what we were doing but

249
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
We learned very quickly

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
And

251
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
We got better

252
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,847
You must have burned through that 45,000 pretty fast

253
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
We did we actually lost half of it in the first year

254
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
I lost $23,000 after you freaking out

255
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
No but the investors were

256
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
My dad was freaking iPad

257
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
But I'm

258
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
I just began to read books

259
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,351
I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds I have read hundred thousand book

260
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
I'm business since the beginning

261
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
I also

262
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
I'm a man. I'm an entrepreneur fly try things

263
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
But if something doesn't work

264
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
I stopped doing it

265
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Enabled us to learn quickly

266
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
And we did make a small

267
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
$5,000 profit in our second year

268
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
How did you do that

269
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
Start managing our cost better started buying better

270
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Less spoilage

271
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Better management of labor hours

272
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
In the very basics of retail

273
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
We didn't really know we had to figure it out

274
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Local hip

275
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Bees in Austin or what did you also have like sort of

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Austin High Society

277
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
So

278
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
One of the job site I tell us because I run into people all the time that

279
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Tell me they were original

280
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Safer a customer can I say

281
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,879
You know half the people that said the original saferway customers had

282
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
I've been there whenever we don't have

283
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
5 times the sales we stopped having

284
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
I like the number of people that went to Woodstock right there

285
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
But now they were all they were all young

286
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
They need four people this was the counterculture and part of the counterculture was

287
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
They wanted their own stores

288
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
I didn't want to go to that traditional

289
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,895
Big Supermarket saving very alien experience forum

290
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Minsoo obviously

291
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
It sounds like you guys were doing pretty well when did you when did you start

292
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Thinking about

293
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
You know

294
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Expanded

295
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Well

296
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
After about when I began to make money the second urine begin to realize that safer way was too small

297
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
And

298
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
I just thought we needed to have a bigger better location

299
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:26,751
Finding a dream about opening a real grocery store where you could do all your shopping there

300
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Yeah

301
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
So

302
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
We found this location

303
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,943
Was this whole night club on a big strip Road in Austin Lamar

304
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
That

305
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
It had burned down in the crowded been a night

306
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
So

307
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
I first had to try to sell our our board on it

308
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,255
And try to get more money and they said this is crazy you lost half the money the first year and this is great you're making money now but

309
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
I want you to stay there for a few years and then you know we'll see

310
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
If I know really got to do

311
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
Going to a bigger store workwear

312
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Repeat it or not well-positioned competitively

313
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
But they weren't buying it

314
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
And

315
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
More like I said look when I want to put more money in

316
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Maybe I can find somebody else

317
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Turn fast

318
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,295
The strategy there being no one else would be stupid enough to invest in this company

319
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
What does email

320
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Crazy entrepreneurs

321
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Has it been successful yet

322
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,279
So I began to hustle anybody I knew that had money I'd already

323
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
People that new people in Madden

324
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Are the Cowboys playing basketball with

325
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,471
That one day we finish playing pickup basketball and

326
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
He got into like a BMW and drove off

327
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Same age of Iowa

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
What is Jay do

329
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Eliza J doesn't do anything

330
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
Hot racing millionaire inherited a bunch of money from his parents

331
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Well I gave you a call the next day

332
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
And it just turned out that Jay and had kind of his own food Consciousness Awakening

333
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Started shopping at safeway luvs safeway

334
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
NJ

335
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Said he would put $50,000 in

336
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
I was like

337
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Wow okay

338
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Went back to our board said

339
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
I got a guy that's going to put $50,000 in

340
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
And then shocked

341
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
And

342
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,223
Several of them decided they wanted to get more money in as well

343
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
So we we

344
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Rented

345
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
That burned-out location

346
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
And

347
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,207
The story there's also kind of interesting because the owner of that building

348
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
Was this guy named Ben Powell and it's been in his family lives he's an attorney living in Houston

349
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
Sometime I had to go and sell him on doing the snap

350
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Supermarket in his building

351
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
I pitched him on A10

352
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,615
He started laughing kind of towards the end of my pet

353
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
I said mister pal what are you laughing at

354
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Anysex

355
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
John

356
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,879
I mean it sounds like let me see in a movie, corny movies said John you are so

357
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Full

358
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Unenthusiastic on you think you can conquer the

359
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
Holy war

360
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
Well I'm going to teach you different son

361
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
But you remind me of myself when I was young

362
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
Let's do your gosh darn

363
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Natural Food supermarket

364
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
And so we were able to get that store open

365
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
However while we were building it

366
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
I want to

367
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
My friendly competitors

368
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
But it opened up

369
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,207
After Safeway was call Clarksville natural grocery and I really love the two entrepreneurs that were doing that Craig Weller Mark's casa

370
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
These are good guys work really hard

371
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Got a good store

372
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
I pitched them would look

373
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,911
Working opens Natural Foods supermarket when the first answer was he born

374
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Anywhere in the world

375
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Aren't you do it with us

376
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
What are they join you instead of young

377
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Exactly

378
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,687
Play join up and go by and by the way if you don't we're only a mile away from your side

379
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Your story you're going to

380
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,831
Now you're going to have trouble competing with us what you told them you basically said to them

381
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,415
Hey this is going to be great let's work together and if you don't were going to crush you

382
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
No I didn't say it that way because sometimes

383
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
Funny thing is when I told the story that's how I get some trailer to meet it was I didn't

384
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Threaten them

385
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
I mean I said

386
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
We're only going to be a mile away we're going to have this big store it's going to be it's going to be harder for you to compete why don't we do this together

387
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
Did they have any any of their own conditions

388
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Yes

389
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,991
One Craigs and Marx conditions is we have to make this a real store

390
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
We have some meat

391
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
We have to sell beer and wine have to sell coffee

392
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
We can't just be

393
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
Completely a vegetarian idealistic store we don't want to partner with

394
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
And I'd already

395
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,631
Thought Craig and Mark store was very successful and I talked to a lot of customers cross shock

396
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
And

397
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
They all wanted us to

398
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
To loosen our products

399
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Standards

400
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
To make it more a real grocery store

401
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
It was kind of like we know if we're going to eat these Foods

402
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
Then we need to be able to we should sell them

403
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
So

404
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
That was a

405
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
Compromise that was made that turn out to be the right compromise from a business

406
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
The business decision perspective and

407
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,839
So the funny thing was they had trouble making up their minds about it and they come down after they close their store up

408
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Northward then construct

409
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
And then literally like

410
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
2 weeks before I throw a set to open

411
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
They

412
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
I've seen enough and they said we're in

413
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
I'm so we had to

414
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
We had to really scramble

415
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,967
To we know we had to try to integrate our our

416
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Our team members together

417
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
And

418
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Way to change the name

419
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
And this is assuming this world was

420
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Is going to come in well

421
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
We started with the name Market

422
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
We are mark

423
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
And then it was like what kind of Market order food market

424
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,935
What kind of food market are we where we're kind of a Natural Foods Market

425
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
What kind of generic a car sells natural food market

426
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
When what kind organic food mart

427
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Yeah but we don't have just organic

428
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
Whole Foods

429
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
And that was at Whole Foods Market that's how it went with her

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Amazon

431
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Spokane weather name

432
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,071
In the store with media success people sometimes ask how long did it take the first Whole Foods Market to be successful

433
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,935
And the answer to answer is it take till about 3 in the afternoon on the first day

434
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,287
Wow was it just because of luck or was that just because of they were

435
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
There was

436
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
Disc Institute glamouring ways an element of luck

437
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
And success in life

438
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
1 reasons I wanted to merge with those guys

439
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Was not only because

440
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
I liked

441
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
And thought they could help us

442
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,743
But I thought you know what if we can get Clarks Hill and safer way in here will have almost enough

443
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Sales between the two stores to break even and then if we get other customers

444
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Willam

445
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Never look back

446
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
But again

447
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
People were so excited about the

448
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
His first or it was

449
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,335
It was amazing and we didn't do any advertising we just open the doors

450
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
But nowhere word

451
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Emmaus

452
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
Was incredible hole Austin kind of

453
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,271
Counterculture hippie Community knew about it immediately

454
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Wow and it just keep

455
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Keep going like that

456
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
From that point on

457
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
No

458
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Like nine months after we opened

459
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,303
Is it now in May of 1981 Austin had the worst flood that it had in about a hundred years

460
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
And our store was located in the hundred year flood

461
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
So we're actually where we were in the hundred year flood plain but when I said what does that mean it's as well about every hundred years you're going to have a

462
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
What I said okay I'll take touchy

463
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,295
I know the Sunday night there been a lot of rain during the weekend but then it just really starting to rain on Sunday in

464
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
I'd gone home

465
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
Was at friend's house having dinner and

466
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,255
Renee started to call and said the water is beginning to rise

467
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
What are we doing. I said take the ball

468
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Beck's pilum up

469
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
In front of the doors

470
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
And inside the store

471
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
Because that's where I thought the water would come in through the doors

472
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Actually

473
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,151
They kept the water out till I got up to about four feet wow

474
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:06,527
But that store was not designed to be a submarine and stuff underwater got up to about 4 feet

475
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
The Punisher weight of the water

476
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
Basically broke through the glass of the doors

477
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
I just came in like a tidal wave

478
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,047
Renee ended up swimming out of the store that night

479
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
And

480
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,703
It was a Sunday and we have three days of sales

481
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
There was in our floor safe so I want to get the cash out of the store

482
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
And I went back with no lights going to

483
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Picture it now with

484
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
All the powers out at snide

485
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
Place around the back

486
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Flashlight

487
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
And there are actually

488
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
People wander around the store looters

489
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Wandering around the store

490
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
One of the back I went into the office and they open up the floor safe

491
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Were they able to pull the money out

492
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
This was a time when

493
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
We didn't take nobody to credit cards

494
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
More than half our money back then was just in cash

495
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,775
I mean I think we had about a hundred thousand dollars

496
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
And

497
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
I'd put it on this grocery pack

498
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,967
And I was wondering out the store in this guy comes up to me and he says hey

499
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
Find anything good in the back room

500
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
I said I'm not sure

501
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,416
Just grab his bag there probably something back there for you go check it out

502
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,768
And we got the money out and put it in a safe place and

503
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
And then we thought we were pretty much out of business they were cars floating down the street watching flow

504
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Floataway

505
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
In just a moment after the flood and had John Mackey

506
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432

00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,600

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

534
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
I'm guy Raz

535
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
So it's the spring of 1981

536
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
First Whole Food store

537
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Is literally under water

538
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
Is only been open for 6 months

539
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
And they had no flood insurance

540
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Hanging a picture what the store was like

541
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
This

542
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:23,136
Tidal wave of water come in and when you have a flood like that all the sewage lines back up as well

543
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
So

544
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
You have all this book

545
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Food and yeah we have

546
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,072
Meat fish and sewage and was just at

547
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Total

548
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
Horrible mess

549
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
And

550
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Stock

551
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Anyhow

552
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
We showed up for work

553
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
And we started cleaning everything up and all those other people I kind of recognize them but they weren't team members and in

554
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
They weren't they were customers

555
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
Can customers and neighbors and everybody was pitching in school we should have died three.

556
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Flight

557
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,976
We had to rebuild the store was going to it's going to cost a lot of money to do that and

558
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
We just didn't have the money

559
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
So I thought

560
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
We're on we all thought we were finished

561
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,960
But every one of the stakeholders rallied and there was a benefit held for the store and

562
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
The team members they work for free

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Are bank loans Money

564
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,104
Oh my signature which was worthless

565
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
And the investors decided to kick in more cash

566
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,808
So we were able to reopen 30 days later that just pulled everybody together we are really United

567
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Around that

568
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Near death experience

569
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
So did you

570
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Focus at the point on

571
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Just getting things in order

572
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
No

573
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
I want to open a second store after

574
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
What it was like

575
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,424
We can't put all of our eggs in a basket in my float down the river

576
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
We've got to have a second store

577
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,592
The second store didn't it didn't start as well as the first story was up in North Austin and it

578
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
In the suburbs coming away from the

579
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,248
The counterculture community of Austin and was trying to Market to more conventional

580
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
No Suburban people in it

581
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
It took a couple years for that store.

582
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Actually transferred profit

583
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
And

584
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
Give me open the third store in Austin in South Austin now that

585
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
That turned out to be

586
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
I very challenging for us

587
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
Because that's tour

588
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,216
Was too close to our original stormed and cannibalized

589
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Significantly

590
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
And together

591
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
We started to lose money

592
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Like has any tension with with

593
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Your partners

594
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Well

595
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
That led to a big debate because one of the

596
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Partners

597
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Mark

598
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
He really didn't want to grow because

599
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
We had this gold mine he just wanted to mine it

600
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Yeah so

601
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
The long and the short of it was that

602
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Mark

603
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Sold his interest

604
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
And the company

605
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
And when it's another Direction in his life so he was the first

606
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,776
Co-founder to exit actually Renee exited slightly before him cuz she and I broke up

607
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,128
And she wanted to travel the world and see other place

608
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
So she got a new boyfriend

609
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
And she left

610
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
And

611
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
Doing a startup business together either

612
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Brings you closer together or

613
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,928
Rip your part in the case of Renee and I ended up ripping us apart

614
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
So then it was just Craig and I laugh

615
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
And I think the partnership

616
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
It challenge when it gets into hard times the good times are easy

617
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
But did you ever did you ever think to yourself

618
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Maybe

619
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Maybe they're right maybe week's attitude

620
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Quickly

621
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Of course I was thinking that

622
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Talimena

623
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
I was regretting that opening the South often store because

624
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
I mean almost all the sales

625
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
It got came at the expense of

626
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Original store so

627
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
But

628
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
I really wanted to grow the business

629
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,000
I mean I am not saying I all the challenges were

630
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Like oh boy another

631
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Drake challenge

632
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
Hitting is really hard but I always saw it as

633
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Okay this is a great lesson for me I can learn

634
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Something here I am learning some

635
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
I learned a lot

636
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
From

637
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Those early

638
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
Failures are those are not only failure for some of the early

639
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
Trials

640
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
If you were looking to 2

641
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Expand the business

642
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
You would have to raise some serious money

643
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Yes

644
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
In 1988 we decided we couldn't

645
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
Grow as fast as we wanted to grow from just

646
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,584
Are retained profits tapped out all of our friends and family

647
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
There was no Angel Network so we needed to raise some venture capital

648
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
This was a time when venture-capital was not

649
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
Really pretty crank up like it is today yeah

650
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
We hired a banker

651
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
And we began to

652
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Try to raise

653
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,248
Venture Capital money and we got rejected again and again and again are we

654
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
Trying to talk to the venture capitalist and they just couldn't get we were doing I mean

655
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
One guy who turned me down

656
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
He said to me he said you know John

657
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
I see you got a pretty good business here but

658
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
It looks to me like I look at all the stores

659
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,888
You just a bunch of hippies and you're just selling food to other hippies

660
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
I don't think that's a very big Market

661
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,544
And if it's going to spread further than then

662
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,616
The big companies are going to take a lot of interest in it

663
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
I don't think you can compete with Safeway

664
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
I don't think you can feed with these big commercial supermarkets going to run out of business

665
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
People still telling me that today I've been hearing it

666
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
40 years I mean he had a point back then

667
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
About the

668
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Of course I'm sure that guy is kicking himself

669
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
Yeah he Pieology apologize to me about 10 years later that was the worst decision ever made

670
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Companies based in Texas or did you go to like

671
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
Silicon Valley like where were you looking for money to go to Silicon Valley

672
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
And we got

673
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
2 based out of Houston

674
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
But

675
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,712
We were beginning to slowly crossover

676
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Because we

677
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
We're not only selling natural organic food but our quality of food was better

678
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,672
I'm so we're beginning to get a more mainstream shopper

679
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
We're coming in

680
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
And that was beginning to drive some progress

681
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,096
So we got to investors from Houston and we got another one out of

682
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Silicon Valley

683
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
And then what did that enable you

684
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
You said it's just

685
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Hispanic

686
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
Yes we sold 34% of the business

687
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
4

688
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
An eight and a half million dollar valuation

689
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
So

690
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
About eight times are earnings

691
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Or about

692
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
So I don't know what 20

693
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Percent 15% of Versailles

694
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
It was

695
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
It's ridiculous the kind of valuations people get today

696
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Compared to what we could get back in the

697
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
The late 1980s

698
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
When you start to think about

699
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Going public

700
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
But

701
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
Venture capital is the night and wants to go public

702
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,056
They wanted us to do another round of venture financing

703
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
But

704
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,920
I was determined not to do another round of venture financing because

705
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
That would have given them control of the company

706
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
And I just didn't trust the Venture God

707
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,160
Venture capitalist for like hitchhiker's hitchhikers with credit cards

708
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
And as long as you take them to where they want to go

709
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
They will help you pay for the gas

710
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
But

711
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
If you don't take them where they want to go

712
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
They will try to hijack the car

713
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,264
And they will hire a new driver

714
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Throw you out on the side of the road

715
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
So I did not

716
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,456
Tres veces I liked him I didn't trust him I did not want him to take control to come

717
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,040
Going to go public and then we're going to get The Hitchhikers out of the car

718
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
So

719
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
There's a little

720
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Early for Whole Foods to go call liquor so I was

721
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,488
Toll later on but we did go public back in 1992

722
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
And we raised about 28 million dollars

723
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
Add overnight your company was worth what

724
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
Overnight be worth about a hundred million

725
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,592
What does that mean I mean does that mean that instantly you had all of his cash and you could

726
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Actually

727
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Row at the

728
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
You wanted to grow

729
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Yes the greatest thing about

730
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Thought it was we had a

731
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Occurrence

732
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
The currency being around stock

733
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,672
We can now go to other companies are like Whole Foods Market

734
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,000
You're the biggest but there were other we had other peers so you are

735
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
So you were looking to buy them

736
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
Yes first one was Bread & circus in

737
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Boss I remember right company

738
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
And

739
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
Next we acquired mrs. Gooch's remember mrs. good shop

740
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
And we did not 93

741
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
We did a big one with fresh peels

742
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,992
And they had 22 short week were there in 1996

743
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
What's good to hide those we were able to grow much faster

744
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
So as you're like expansion

745
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Just move data

746
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
The clap right through the 90s

747
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
7 to mm

748
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,768
Yeah I mean I have to

749
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Assume that you also

750
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
We're changing how

751
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
Supply chains worked in NM and how people

752
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Mapreduce

753
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Food and and

754
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
I guess

755
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Create new markets

756
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
For organic food

757
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
That's really true we did

758
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
I mean

759
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
We didn't do it by ourselves honestly but

760
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,320
Because you have Farmers but we created much of the demand

761
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
4 National organic in the United

762
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
State our success.

763
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
And

764
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,560
That created more farmers and more entrepreneurs wanting to farm organic

765
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
Claremore manufacturers wanting to produce organic

766
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
Manufactured goods so we helped

767
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
We had a huge impact

768
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
We still do

769
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Yeah

770
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,336
What what percentage of

771
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
The grocery market

772
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Does Whole Foods

773
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
Gun control today in the US

774
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
I think it's about

775
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
1 1/2 to 2%

776
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
We don't control that by the way right

777
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,464
Yeah but about 1 to 2% of all grocery

778
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Which is a lot smaller than I think a lot of people

779
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
People would assume because

780
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Is Whole Foods influences

781
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Probably

782
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Much greater than

783
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,448
Thank you I like I said we're like a boxer punching above our weight class

784
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah I mean it's it's it's surprising at how many stores are are do you have to

785
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
We have about 460

786
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
I want to ask you a question

787
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Stores

788
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
Because you of course have heard the joke

789
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
The Whole Foods

790
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Is Mike Holt

791
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Paycheck writing

792
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
The prices are so expensive

793
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
For most people so

794
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
I mean do you think that's a fair criticism

795
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Well

796
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Course we don't like that

797
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
That's not at 1

798
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Nickname was given to us it was first giving

799
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
2 as affectionately

800
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
The people who loved us

801
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
And then it became a club

802
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,032
People would be on Whole Foods you didn't like her

803
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
There's a kind of a tendency I think

804
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
For people to think

805
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
You can get the same quality stuff at lower prices

806
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
I don't think

807
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
People have the same quality Whole Foods ass

808
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
I think we have the best quality

809
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
So it's about a

810
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Trade-offs

811
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
That there exists between quality and price

812
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
You have people who

813
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
Who attacked you as well cuz you

814
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
And you've been kind of a lightning rod

815
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
With some of the things that you

816
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
You said and written about

817
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
Like I'm a change in unions that don't

818
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,872
Interviews of I guess people that don't associate with jive with Whole Foods

819
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
Well my take is a course that the people that know me like me people that don't know me and and they

820
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
I just read things or hear things they project

821
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
But

822
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
Yeah I've learned

823
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
I learned a lot

824
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
I've learned that they're like

825
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
Four topics I just don't talk about in public anymore what are they

826
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,704
I don't talk about politics religion sex or GMOs

827
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
What what what is there left

828
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Talk about

829
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
I mean I don't even care if people hated me it's just that then they try to attack Whole Foods yeah baby stop picking on me

830
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
My kid

831
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,808
Do whatever you want with me but leave the kids out of it

832
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
John Wayne somebody like

833
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
Anyone listen to this has been to call for

834
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
When I walk into a whole food

835
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
There's a feeling that you get

836
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
At the company

837
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
Has certain values that I think a lot of the Shoppers identify with

838
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Right there as you know

839
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
There's

840
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
They're sort of a n

841
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
An attempt to to help me

842
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Make the world a better place since

843
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
2

844
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,128
Community organizations and it's

845
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
If you

846
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Very

847
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
I mean lack of a better word it feels

848
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
Tattoo till our people and so

849
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
You can understand why people

850
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Are interested in the

851
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
People behind

852
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
You guys are interested in how you

853
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Yes

854
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
And

855
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,888
I don't know I don't equate liberal with caring

856
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,216
So I don't like going to get in a political argument with you but

857
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,848
There's a meta-narrative about business in our world net narrative is that business suck

858
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
And businesses

859
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
Is greedy and selfish and exploitative

860
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
It only cares about money

861
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
But

862
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
People don't want to believe Whole Foods Market

863
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:41,184
It's a different kind of company we are we're purpose-driven were stakeholder focused

864
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
If I'm proud of anything

865
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
It's that Whole Foods Market have me to do

866
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
And I we do care

867
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
You know I'm wondering whether some of the

868
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
The criticism that you

869
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
You've had over the years

870
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
See no evil away Whole Foods does

871
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Is business

872
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,360
Has been improved whole foods that have there been times where people have said

873
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Hey you know what

874
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
Who is doing with this is wrong and

875
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
And and and

876
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,272
Or protesting Hadassah change the way you guys have actually operate

877
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,624
Yeah has I mean the most famous example is backing

878
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
In two thousand and

879
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
3

880
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
We are being picketed by

881
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
Animal rights activists

882
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
That

883
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,912
We're very unhappy about this particular duck we were selling which they considered to be a factory farm.

884
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
What I got

885
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Your dialogue with one of the activist

886
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Abra passionate so young

887
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
A woman named Lauren Cornelius

888
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
And I know after about a month or so

889
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
She sends me an email and she says

890
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,016
You know Mr Mackey IC after all

891
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Dialogue that you are very idealistic

892
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
However

893
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
When it comes to

894
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Livestock animals

895
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,000
Honestly you don't know what you're talkin about you are not well informed on the subject

896
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
And

897
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,608
You know I thought about it but you know she's really right I don't know that much about

898
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Personally I'm just

899
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,240
I decided to become an expert myself and that summer summer 2003 I read about a dozen books

900
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
How we raise animals in America

901
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
And I was utterly horrified

902
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
I guess I just been living in denial it was probably wake up call

903
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Call for me

904
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
And

905
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
By the end of the summer

906
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,392
I had made to resolution one I was going to go

907
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Becoming vegan

908
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
The number to I Knew Whole Foods needed to do a much better job

909
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
That the accusations that the animal rights people inmate about

910
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
What we were doing were fundamentally

911
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Correct we

912
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,216
Then began the process of bringing in animal activist

913
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
And Whole Foods people and dialogue

914
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,432
And that led to the global animal partnership which Whole Foods Market's ponsford and

915
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,784
Trying to follow the gaap standards for the last several years

916
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
I'm trying you still

917
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,000
Portia live in Austin so I'm assuming that now and again you must pass

918
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
By the location of

919
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Storedog

920
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,192
You ever go out of my way to pass by and what is it today

921
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
It's a school

922
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
It's a school in front one of my friends started that school

923
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
And

924
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
I got a tour of it a few years ago

925
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
Anything that was so hardcore they change some of it

926
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,320
Karachi I remembered it

927
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
Just like it was yesterday and I could see where the

928
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Are we on our block benzoate

929
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
See

930
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Cuz they left

931
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
The basic structure of an impact

932
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,096
So it was it was a trip down memory Road for sure

933
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
China Eastern Point

934
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
I need you when you will not

935
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Run Hozier

936
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
Retire whatever I mean

937
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
Kent Candle Company can Whole Foods continue without

938
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
And we have to

939
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Charisma without your charisma without

940
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
Your vision

941
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
Of course

942
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
A can

943
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
And but I mean I do think when the

944
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
When the founder on the last founder left and Craig was the second-to-last I think he left almost went

945
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Years ago

946
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
And lot of the people that built the business with

947
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:07,008
Besides the founders their retiring now cuz in their sixties and they paid a lot of money to over the years to Whole Foods

948
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,360
So they'll be no one ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as

949
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
If I love it

950
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Yeah but

951
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,248
Building a business is a little bit like having children watching the show and grow up is that you

952
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
You hope your

953
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
Child is healthy and you hope your child is happy and you know it

954
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
How has integrity and does the right thing and

955
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
I think it's important to have a a good

956
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Founder and entrepreneur

957
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
The great businesses

958
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Continue to live on after

959
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
Remove sky

960
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:37,472
Whole Foods is in that in that space

961
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
John Mackey co-founder

962
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,688
CEO of Whole Foods and last summer just a few months after this interview first ran

963
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,248
Whole Foods was purchased by Amazon

964
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,832
Can a deal worth nearly 14 billion dollars

965
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,728
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things

966
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Your building

967
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
The first a quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

968
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,920
Who wants you to know that the newest member of the Microsoft Surface family

969
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
The Surface Pro 6

970
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
Has up to 13 and a half hours of

971
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Battery life

972
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
8th gen Intel Core processor

973
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
You can work for as long as you want to

974
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Wherever work takes

975
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

976
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Time now for how you

977
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
You built that

978
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
And today we're running a story we

979
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
First man

980
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
About a year ago

981
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Steve humble

982
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
History

983
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Starts

984
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:50,176
At the movies

985
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,528
Where Harrison Ford is stuck in a room is

986
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Burst into flames

987
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,440
So there's two scooters chair to the only place that is not on fire

988
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Which is the stone fireplace

989
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,840
And then and I think you know where I'm going with this

990
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
The fireplace suddenly

991
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,728
Spins in Indiana is it a whole crew in this room

992
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,872
It's full of Nazis

993
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Steve heese

994
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
A mechanical engineer

995
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Some years ago

996
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,272
He was living in Salt Lake City renting a big house

997
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
Some friends and there was a

998
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Spot in the house that was a big

999
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Stone Hearth

1000
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,024
I have always been kind of fascinated with secret passageways

1001
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
And I thought I could totally make

1002
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Secret passageway like what I seen the Last Crusade

1003
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:48,032
Because let's face it how awesome would it be to have a secret passageway in your house

1004
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
And more Steve mull it over

1005
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
The more he thought you know I've been other people who want one too

1006
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
So the first thing you did was to Google secret passageway building companies and there was nobody

1007
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Absolutely nobody anywhere but could make be secret doors like we're in the movies you know motorized and and maybe

1008
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
High security stuff

1009
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,071
The times he was pretty bored of his day job

1010
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,191
So he starts a dream of creating a business that would build secret passageways

1011
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,007
And he called up some contractor friends

1012
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,103
Witcher clients possibly be interested in something like this

1013
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,431
And I got overwhelmingly positive feedback

1014
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,527
So eventually you know I decided I'm going to do this thing

1015
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
I quit my job

1016
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
I had to move

1017
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
And with my parents

1018
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,207
Steve moved to his parents place in Mesa Arizona

1019
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Restart the tinker and his dad's garage

1020
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:46,143
And it just so happens in an old high school buddy was building a house nearby so you said

1021
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
Hey why don't I build you a secret hiding place

1022
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,031
He had a niche in the wall with a recess

1023
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,823
And he kept

1024
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
A vase in there

1025
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
And I made it so that when you twist the vase

1026
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
A painting on the wall opens

1027
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
And it exposed fingerprint scanner and then when you scan your print

1028
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,927
The niche itself would slide upwards towards the ceiling

1029
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,999
And it was replaced From Below by a gun safe

1030
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
A hidden gun safe

1031
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
Took this point Steve started to Market his idea

1032
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:24,031
You got a story in a local paper and with a year people started to find a big people

1033
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,127
People you would have heard of and they are building multi million dollar houses

1034
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
Of course we ask them for the salacious details but I wish I could

1035
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Secrecy

1036
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
So anyway to Steven suddenly in his dream job he's flying around the world he's working on palatial homes putting in

1037
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
False

1038
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
Fingerprint scanners and secret doors for people whose names he cannot reveal

1039
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,703
A little bit like an imposter you know I show up at his house where there's

1040
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
This incredible

1041
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Team of talent

1042
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
But I kept reminding myself that nobody knows how to make secret passageways in a better than I do certainly no

1043
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
Any more than I have

1044
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,039
So I guess I am the expert at this

1045
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,135
A custom-made Secret Door starts at around $9,000

1046
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,231
But Steve's recently introduced a cheaper line of a secret doors just

1047
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,631
1500 bucks and then make it look like anything other than the door

1048
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Frank Mir

1049
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
What is a bookcase

1050
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
One is a wardrobe

1051
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,591
And another one who can install one secret doors in front of your spare bedroom or

1052
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Closet

1053
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,455
You hide what you want and then you trigger the door by remote control

1054
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
And Steve says he's barely advertised

1055
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:43,647
And he's already selling about one of these a day on a clear trajectory to surpass

1056
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
Our Core Business

1057
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Cheese company is called

1058
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
Creative home engineering and today

1059
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
Those cheaper

1060
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
$1,500 doors are in

1061
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Selling faster than

1062
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
Fancy custom-made one

1063
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
To keep up with demand

1064
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Steve has hired

1065
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
Some new employees has a new Factory in
