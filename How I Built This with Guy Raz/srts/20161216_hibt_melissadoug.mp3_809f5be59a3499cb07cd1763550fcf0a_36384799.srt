1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Basically what happened is when we called the store

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
You know hey let's can I send you some more nope can't it's not selling and we would

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Always say but you're not selling it to take note it's not selling and this happened

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Time and time again and then after about 2 months it was like this stuff is taking up too much space I want it out of my sight

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Ramen

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
The ark is how I built this

7
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements they built

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
The story of how Melissa & Doug

9
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,504
Bernstein Delta multimillion-dollar toy company without ever selling a single screen

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
Video game or app

11
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Okay so

12
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,024
If you have a small child in your life may be a niece or nephew or a grandchild

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Maybe your own child

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,144
At some point in the next few days this time of year you

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
You will find yourself

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
In a toy store and you will be frantic

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
Looking for a new Transformer or

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Shopkins

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,896
Angry Birds video games

20
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
Why you're doing that

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
You might stumble on

22
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
Toys made by Melissa & Doug Burns things are toys

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
They do not have to be plugged in or

24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Charged

25
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
Upgraded with the latest

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
Software

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
They're just simple old-fashioned toys affect things like

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Wooden blocks

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
He said

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Puzzles

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Easels

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
And the company which is

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
Actually called Melissa & Doug

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Was created

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
Melissa & Doug Bernstein

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
We're still dating back

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
In 1988

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
And the way they met

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
They were actually introduced by their parents

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
What's it like love at first sight

41
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Instant connection

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,296
I think from Alyssa with love at first sight would be my guess

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,904
Ino it was very interesting because we are both very

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Strong people

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
So I would say it was

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
Interesting yet contentious

47
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Social what were you guys

48
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Doing

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Time in your life

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
You know I've always been a

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Wild

52
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Creative but never believed that

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
Could turn into a vocation

54
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
So of course

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Instead of pursuing creative

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,272
Things I ended up as an investment banker at Morgan

57
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
What is a creative job in the world by the way did not like numbers because her

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
What were you doing

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
I

60
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Was I right out of

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,584
School I was planning on going into education and I

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Wanted to you

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Work at a university

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
And

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Right when I was getting ready to do that

66
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
And head off into it

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Career in High Ridge

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Educational

69
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Got a call from a person I work Summers Ford

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Jim McManus

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
One of the

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,736
Greatest mentors greatest marketing people in the world and

73
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,112
Mr McManus said nope you're not doing that you're going to come work for me and be my

74
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,720
My assistant be my right-hand and so I went there right after

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
School work for mister

76
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
McManus for a couple of years and had

77
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Incredible

78
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Experience

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
But it wasn't what you want

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,984
It wasn't something that I wouldn't want to do I'm like Melissa at her invest

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Banking experience

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,848
But no but there was something inside me that tugged and wanted to

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Things one wanted

84
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
To do something

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
4 children frankly wanted to

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
Do something of my own

87
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Creation also

88
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Wright suits

89
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
What did you do

90
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Well we

91
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Booked ourselves into a little

92
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,072
Bed and breakfast in Lenox Massachusetts I think was called the cliftwood

93
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
And we walked ourselves in the room

94
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
And

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,544
Did what everyone would do if locked in a room in Lenox Massachusetts and brainstorm business ideas

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,176
We literally said let's close this door and we are not leaving this place until we know what our path is

97
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,296
What we're going to do what was the idea you came up with in that hotel room in Lenox message

98
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
I think we walked out of there knowing that we wanted to start by doing some

99
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Interactive

100
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
Products for children things that they could really

101
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
Interact with rather than be

102
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Passive recipients

103
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
So okay so you get back to West

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Report Connecticut and like what did you do

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Within a week's

106
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Quit your jobs

107
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
We did

108
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,383
We determined that this is what we were doing we literally took our

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Savings account

110
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,527
Put them in one joint account which was nothing but meager

111
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
At best

112
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
And we

113
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
Decided we were going to use those funds to

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,255
Create our first product at this point

115
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Melissa

116
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Are your parents regretting that they introduced

117
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
That's funny that you

118
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
You say that

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
And I would have to say

120
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
My parents

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
We're scared to death

122
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
I bet I remember when we were in Melissa's kitchen and we were right

123
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
Talking about doing this I remember them being

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Concerned

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Say because

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
She had the greatest thing going

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
And

128
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
She was leaving it to do well we weren't

129
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,463
Two serpents jacket we were going to do

130
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
No problem

131
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
You know they work as as

132
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Depression-era

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
People they were just very fearful

134
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Worried

135
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
About Sakura

136
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Whereas

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
We couldn't have been less work

138
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
We felt like it

139
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Warrant living out

140
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Your passion and

141
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Wanting to go to work at

142
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Everyday running to work everyday

143
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Then it didn't matter how

144
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Zoe

145
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
She was got this like

146
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Small amount of money in

147
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
And

148
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
What's the product

149
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
So what we decided to do first

150
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
It was

151
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
We both had

152
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
A little bit of it

153
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Experience with

154
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
With

155
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Television

156
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Television

157
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Programming

158
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
And we decided that we wanted to make

159
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
The program

160
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
For children

161
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
That would be groundbreaking in that children wouldn't

162
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Sit there and

163
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
And watch it

164
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
They would actually participate

165
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
The program

166
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
And so we literally

167
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Rote

168
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Scripted

169
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Produced

170
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Directed

171
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Cast

172
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Wrote music Melissa song

173
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Sweetest Thing lyrics

174
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
Like a VHS

175
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Video

176
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Ultimately

177
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
Three of them do what you were

178
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
You like eating

179
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
You were on camera

180
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
So we wrote a script for this

181
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
And

182
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
We literally went around to stores and

183
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
Parks and we cast real children

184
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
We didn't want the

185
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
To be

186
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
Contrived or fake

187
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
We didn't go to

188
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Casting age

189
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
We literally would

190
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Would sit in

191
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
Grocery stores and look for animated children

192
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
An approach language

193
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Probably

194
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,999
Today

195
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
We literally in parking lots would watch

196
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
Apps for children that are interacting well with their parents and we had eight children that were in this V

197
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,031
Video and then we shot it it some

198
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Friends houses

199
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Westport Connecticut

200
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
From schools

201
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
Kids singing was it dancing yes and yes it was singing it was dancing

202
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
And it was

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Encouraging children

204
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Who are watching this

205
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Participate along

206
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
Was literally teaching them some of the songs

207
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Teaching them

208
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
What were dance

209
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
Dancing to talking directly one of the things that was so unique about it is

210
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
The boy who led the

211
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Programs

212
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Talk directly to the kids at home and

213
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Truly

214
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Befriended them in a very

215
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Honest and

216
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Insincere way

217
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
Do you remember if you remember any of the songs

218
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
My kind of girl

219
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Go ahead most thing it

220
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Ready

221
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:53,599
Special friends special friends we will be special friends

222
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
That was like the the emotional one at the end

223
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
But the others were very

224
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,351
Dooby dooby all sorts of making sounds with your body make

225
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Sounds with your lips

226
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
How much money did you guys

227
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Sink into

228
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Because at that time it was not

229
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Cheat to make films

230
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
What's a lot

231
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Probably

232
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
I think all told the first one we probably spent about

233
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
30 or $40,000

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
To produce

235
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Well it did it took all of our savings and then

236
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Finish this we said wow this

237
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
This is awesome

238
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
And then we looked at

239
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Each other

240
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
We'll wait what do we do with it

241
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
We had put

242
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
No thought at all

243
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Into what do we do with this product

244
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
We now have to figure out well how

245
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
How are we going to be no pay for the next

246
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
Lunch and and what are we going to do to get the

247
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
This product out there

248
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
So

249
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Do you make

250
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
But thousands of copies

251
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
To start the salad

252
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
So we did and we got our first little lessons in business

253
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Because right

254
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
You want to make some copies and

255
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Can you find out

256
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Well we won't make

257
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Four copies we

258
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
U5000 copy

259
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
And we said what in the world are we going to do with 5000 coffee

260
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Please we made list

261
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
Silver relatives and that didn't get us fully to 5000

262
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,703
And so we literally bought a little

263
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Combination television VCR player

264
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,407
Put it in the back of my father's station wagon and we started driving around

265
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Knocking on doors of retailers

266
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
And the funny thing was this was right around the holiday

267
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Play time when we

268
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
We finish this product

269
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
And so all the little

270
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,231
Mom pop toy shops throughout the New England this was there

271
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,095
Busiest time of year and we would walk in there and apologetically carry in our

272
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,983
Tape player in our TV and put it on their counter and beg them please can we just show this to you please

273
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
And I think after enough begging the

274
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,383
Figured out the only way to get us out of their store was to

275
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,223
Take a few of these and present them to their customers so we would leave

276
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
Very happy that they decided to take a few of these

277
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,647
Tapes and try to sell them by the way this was another thing that was completely against

278
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
What was happening in the end

279
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Because

280
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
As a manufacturer you never went directly in

281
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
You actually

282
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
We had middle

283
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Call call Daniel

284
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Raps

285
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Who represented your product

286
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
But we

287
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Realized that if we used one of those

288
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
I mean they would never do R1

289
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Tiny little product Justice

290
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Hundreds and thousands

291
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
The products

292
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
And that if we

293
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Wanted to get our product

294
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Truly distributed

295
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
That we were going to have to do it or

296
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
So our sales

297
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
At the beginning

298
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
People were not buying these

299
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
He's from the stores

300
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,839
So they were baiting in the stores and they were remaining on the shells which is not good for long term

301
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Business proposition so we learned

302
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
Yet another few business lessons

303
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
One was

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
What we learned

305
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Are packaging was interesting because

306
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
You looked at it and you had no idea

307
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Idea what the

308
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
This product was

309
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
I called the mysteries in a box

310
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
When you have something that is in a box

311
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
And you have no idea what it is and you're not

312
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Promoting it on TV or advertising it

313
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
It's very hard

314
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,767
And the second thing we learned was that for something new like this you need to help

315
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Seed some knowledge

316
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Support about it

317
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
It's so Melissa and I then started

318
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
All of are we

319
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Weekend driving back around

320
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Restores all throughout the

321
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Connecticut New York

322
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
New Jersey map

323
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Chusetts

324
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
And we would have play dates in their stores

325
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
And we would sit down in a carpeted area

326
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
The store

327
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Songs with children weeaboo

328
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,063
Hope and pray that they would be one child their two children they are in

329
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Maybe they would tell a couple of friends

330
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
But it sounds like

331
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
I mean not to be like

332
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Cruel or crude but like

333
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Become a failure

334
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
I would say it depends on how you do

335
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Define the word failure

336
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
Because it probably was a failure in terms of

337
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Having a product

338
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
The instantly salt

339
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
And instantly with

340
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Successful

341
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Yet it was the biggest

342
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,687
Success we ever had in that what we learned from that and all the learns came from that are

343
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Precisely every single thing that are busy

344
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Toothpaste on today

345
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Tumblr

346
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
What's the point you know

347
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
The idea of having direct relationship

348
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
With all these customers

349
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
Doing anything that they want it I mean they would call us in the middle of the night

350
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Problem with one of your tapes

351
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
The phone was on her bed we would answer

352
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
In the middle of the night

353
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,983
Everything we do today we learned I would say in that first

354
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
First couple of years and frankly

355
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Maybe most importantly

356
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Just the fact that

357
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Not everything is going to work perfect

358
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
So at this point where you guys called Melissa & Doug

359
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Your company

360
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
We actually

361
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Weren't

362
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Our first

363
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Company name

364
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
We called ourselves

365
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Lights

366
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Camera interaction

367
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
And the reason

368
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
The companies called Melissa

369
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
It's funny

370
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Because

371
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
Weed from day one every

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
A single product we made we were signing our name

373
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
And we were riding on the back

374
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Activate if you have any comments for us

375
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Please call us at

376
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Melissa & Doug

377
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,199
And so as we started to get more more products out there people would call our company

378
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
We would answer

379
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
The phone or someone would answer

380
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
The phone and say

381
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Lights camera traction

382
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
I'm sorry I have the wrong number I was

383
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Melissa & Doug

384
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
And so one day we said well wait let's just answer the phone say home listen dog

385
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
And that's how we became listen

386
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
4 alarm

387
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,471
One or two years in we are three years into it at this point so focusing in Thailand video

388
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
The first one

389
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Basically it was a video year we produced a video year 4

390
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,919
3 years we got 3 videos out there in relationships now with I'd say probably

391
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
I'm going to guess a couple thousand

392
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Retailers

393
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
So how did you like move from

394
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Videos to

395
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Toys

396
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
Have you like start to think

397
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Start making

398
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,511
Well honestly like most things it was another Brain Stew

399
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
We were talking

400
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
In the car about

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Some of our favorite child

402
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Toys and

403
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
We're talking about on Pat the cat

404
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Pat the bunny yeah right oh yeah

405
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Of course books that had

406
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
The Tactical

407
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
I'm pieces on them to touch women

408
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Pat the bunny

409
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Thinking about exactly

410
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
And we said

411
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
I don't know

412
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
What made us a at but we said well wouldn't that be

413
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Great in a puzzle

414
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Could do

415
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
A tactile puzzle

416
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
And

417
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
We brainstormed

418
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Not having a puzzle that had animals

419
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
And that the

420
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Height of each animal was

421
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
A piece of plush that had the

422
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
That animal in the look

423
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,751
And came up with this idea for what we caught a fuzzy puzzle

424
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
And

425
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Uno

426
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
How to design a puzzle in where to get a manufactured and

427
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Produced in

428
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Where where did you going to begin

429
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,575
I would say for most of the things that have happened along the way we had no idea

430
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
And we learned as we went and we would

431
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
Almost the way you were asking the question now we would ask ourselves the question then so

432
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
So wait a second

433
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
We need animals

434
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Artist

435
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
How do we do that so we went to the library

436
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Are we looking at

437
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
A lot of children's books

438
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Look for illustrators that we liked and we would

439
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,615
Contact illustrators NYC who might want to help illustrate this

440
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
I'm in

441
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Each step of the way was

442
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
You know a new

443
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,551
New face of learning but at no point was there ever

444
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,391
A a magic answer or an easy answer with lot of

445
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Making mistakes and falling down and

446
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Some

447
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
Some horrible learning experiences along the way

448
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
How did you guys

449
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Find your

450
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
How are you able to like

451
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
You know pay for the manufacturer

452
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Puzzles

453
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Take loan to

454
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Cosecant investors

455
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
You know this is why we grew rather slowly

456
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
We wanted to be

457
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Be self-funded

458
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
And we lived incredibly

459
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Frugally

460
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
For at least 3 years

461
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
We ate

462
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
Ramen noodles which were $84 and

463
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Turkey hot dogs

464
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
On a hot plate

465
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
About 50 cents a meal

466
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
And we live

467
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
With our parents for a few years

468
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Until we

469
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
You know

470
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,447
You literally get one room in someone's home above their garage

471
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
And helping with errands for

472
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
You know what

473
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Decrease in rent

474
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
And we've been Outfield every cent

475
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
That we made back

476
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,223
Into image what I would say we we literally were not we did not take

477
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Take money out of

478
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Career that

479
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Like the fuzzy puzzle

480
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Were you able to sell it

481
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Oh gosh I wish it were that easy

482
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
Not quite not quite like that so now so so once we had the design for

483
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
The puzzle I mean everything again was

484
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Trial and error but I could tell you one of the things that happened early on was the very first time we went to a very large

485
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Toys

486
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Show

487
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Where you would exhibit

488
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Two retailers and show them your products

489
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,455
And the agent who we hire to help us make our puzzles had a

490
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
Display setup just down the hall for

491
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
With our exact puzzle when he was selling who's basically

492
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Selling your puzzles as

493
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
His own

494
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Yes he was

495
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
And this is someone that we had a

496
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
Entrusted and he told us the reason was because

497
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
We wanted to

498
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,399
Grow slowly and bro with r are independent neighborhood stores

499
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
And he wanted us to immediately take them and put them in the mass-market and

500
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,871
And because we didn't want to do that he figured he would just do that on his own with our Prada

501
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
So that was his good reason

502
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
For doing

503
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
So

504
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
I'm just curious like

505
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
Your reaction at that moment was

506
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
To go to say what are you doing

507
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
What's going on

508
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Did you confront him

509
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
No we weren't confrontational about it we ready

510
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Huge show thousands of customers

511
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
And when they came to us

512
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
And they started to tell us at

513
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
This is what this person was

514
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Was doing

515
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,519
And they assume that we were part of it or that we knew was going on when they found out the

516
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
The truth of what was going on

517
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
It was amazing how many customers

518
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Just came up to us

519
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
And literally

520
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
In front of us

521
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
Ripped up orders that they had

522
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Had placed with this

523
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
Person who was our aging

524
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Since I hear you

525
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
You can show this to him

526
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,719
Now that we understand what's going on we will absolutely never in our life

527
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Time Warner anything for

528
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Fat person

529
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
I think that gave

530
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
A little glimmer of hope

531
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Blessed myself

532
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,215
While on one hand we had a little bit of an exposure to the

533
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
The darker side of the business world

534
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
I would say simultaneously we had a really nice exposure

535
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
To that there are a lot of

536
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
People out there who

537
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Will appreciate

538
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
The Loyalty that you have to them

539
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
And everything that we

540
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
We've done to them and

541
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
The first couple of years

542
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
And are now saying to us

543
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
We don't care even if he wants to

544
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
To sell it to us for

545
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Less money than you are anything

546
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
I think it doesn't matter we are loyal to you for everything

547
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
I'm guessing you guys were able to

548
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
To recover from

549
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Like move on with puzzles

550
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
I guess

551
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,055
We we started to see our way you know it's always about right finding the path through the forest and it was like

552
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
This was the category that

553
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Sort of was our path we said oh my gosh I think we're onto some

554
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
When we come back in a moment

555
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
The story of how Melissa & Doug Ruby on puzzles

556
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
And then made the biggest investment of their lives

557
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
It's not a toy that became a million-dollar

558
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Mistake

559
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
And I was listening to how I built this

560
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
VR

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183

Gyros seoul

605
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
This point it's

606
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
The mid-1990s

607
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
Toy company Melissa and Doug

608
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Is literally

609
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Just Melissa & Doug

610
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Two-person operation

611
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
Melissa designs all the

612
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
Puzzles Doug

613
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Try to get them into

614
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Stores

615
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
But then they decide to start making

616
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Other toys

617
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
You know all these made up until that point

618
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Apostle

619
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
And we look backward at what was

620
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Wonderful

621
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,752
And incredible from the past and we saw wooden toys that category and we said

622
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
Okay here's another category wooden toys

623
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Wow really expensive

624
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Completely inaccessible

625
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
2 average

626
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
People

627
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
The aesthetic

628
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Very

629
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Unapproachable

630
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
Two kids not very playful

631
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
And here's a category that we can go in and we can

632
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Really really

633
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
So at this point like

634
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
Kids are playing with plastic

635
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
Play toys and battery operated toys and envy you guys thinking we're going to be the anti

636
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Battery Toys

637
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
We're not going to do that

638
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
So we thought it was so

639
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Interesting that every toys

640
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Was chasing

641
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Running forward right chasing the hottest fads in

642
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Trends and hot license

643
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Was like

644
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,344
Get out probably Cabbage Patch dolls and TV advertise toys and a lot of sort of hot toys

645
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
And that was

646
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
Kind of the market

647
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
And we

648
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Saw in this

649
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
Experiment with puzzles that ended up working we saw

650
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Oh my goodness

651
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
People actually still want

652
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Things that are nostalgic

653
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,960
Make them remember their past but they don't want them Dusty

654
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
And like they found them in some old attic

655
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
They want them

656
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
You know injected with Pizzazz and brought to

657
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
So what did you say to me

658
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
What are first line was about

659
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
A dozen basic

660
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
Basics reinvent

661
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
Pounding and sorting and stacking

662
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
Manipulating

663
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Alright land blocks yeah yeah

664
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
And doing them at

665
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
Incredibly low price points

666
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
And

667
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,096
Packaging them in a way that I've never been package with a package or designing all of this

668
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Samosa

669
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Yes

670
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
It's all made out of like

671
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Plastic

672
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Or would

673
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
I mean

674
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
50% of what we make is still wood

675
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
And then

676
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
Other materials we use a lot of metal

677
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Use canvas

678
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
But mostly not

679
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
So at this point are you guys

680
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Do you have an office

681
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Do you have a place for

682
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
We working at up or are you sick

683
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
This is still just a

684
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,952
Truview orders now do not have some employees

685
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,840
Heights at this point we probably had a couple of part-time people that were helping us we have

686
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,192
So we have a person who's coming up on his 20 years this year

687
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
His first job with us was

688
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
A mix between helping us

689
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
Change our baby Brandon's diapers

690
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
Helping us weed the driveway

691
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
And also when trucks would come

692
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,368
Deliver products to our house he would help us unload the truck and load the products in in

693
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Help us pack up

694
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Products and ship them

695
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,768
So when you really like transitions from puzzles to wooden toys

696
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
You're still just selling them mainly in like

697
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Small

698
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Start independent stores in New England

699
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Yes

700
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,544
What is time we ate expanded Beyond New England but definitely the small

701
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
In stores we were

702
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Firmly convinced that that

703
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Was the only way we could really get our products out there

704
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
So I mean sound like

705
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
You guys are not pretty steady path

706
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
And did you make any

707
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
We have actually never made a mistake it's the

708
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,144
Craziest we have had so many failures that's why we love that word because

709
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Failure is a word you have to get comfortable with and you can't

710
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Fear the failure

711
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,080
So tell me about some of what were some of them

712
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
So behind my desk

713
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,688
I have

714
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,320
About I can't even fit them anymore maybe 500 toys that were all my very favorite

715
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
Toys that failed in a big way

716
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Some of them entire categories because

717
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Everyday I want to remind myself when I

718
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,096
Come to work and come to my desk that the line between success

719
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
Send failure is as fine as a spider web and you really never know what were some of the

720
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
That didn't work

721
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
Oh my gosh so many but one of the lines that we were most excited about and I think was a

722
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
Huge investment with a line called puzzle world

723
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
And it was an entire world

724
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Made out of puzzle pieces

725
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Not only horizontally they connected to form a base but you could build up vertically and don't skyscrapers

726
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
It was the most amazing

727
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,192
Line ever but also our most elaborate undertaking and above more to Lenny Moore Machining it was

728
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,592
Far our largest Endeavor ever hear of development play tables and it was very expensive

729
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,224
And costly to buy inventory because unlike other products the retails were about 30 to $100

730
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,808
Forceps they were sold in sets

731
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
It was not

732
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
And we had all our prototypes

733
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Which took us over a year

734
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,304
To create and only brought it to Troy fair and had our play table out and the reaction

735
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,704
Was actually incredible the best ever of we have I believe we have

736
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Had a thousand assortment

737
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,056
And we literally by the third day of toys are we sold out

738
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
But we made it clear to our retailers

739
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,736
That this was going to be a big undertaking for that because

740
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,552
This was not an item that was TV advertised

741
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,160
It was expensive part understand

742
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,536
And it was going to take a lot of education on their part educating their cuss

743
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
About the merits of this but we told them

744
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
If they do this it will be an annuity

745
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
They walk

746
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Have you know years and years

747
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,360
Of the selling and generations by more sets and will create more

748
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Jessica each set connect

749
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
Get to the other side it was all interconnected and it even connected to the popular Railway sets at the time the Thomas and the bre

750
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Rio so it connected into

751
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Any existing

752
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
That you had as well

753
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
And they agreed and we

754
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Turn it out

755
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Do you want to

756
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Oh Sherrie she

757
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,704
But not tonight she tells all the exciting gray part it all came back to us

758
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:26,848
Warehouse receiving it all back that was my role in what happened people just didn't buy it

759
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Basically what happened

760
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,248
Is when we called the stores two weeks later you know hey let's can I send you some more

761
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Nope can't

762
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
It's not selling

763
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
And we would always say

764
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
But you're not selling it

765
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
Delete a note it's not selling

766
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
And this happened time and time again

767
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
And then after about 2 months it was like

768
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
This stuff is taking up too much space

769
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Case I wanted out of

770
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
At my store but it just didn't it just it never took off

771
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
The stores never got behind

772
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
I mean I think it had the

773
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
The potential to

774
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,128
But it's hard you know it's

775
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
It's hard to run a store and you have thousands of products

776
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
And you have lots of

777
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Competing interests and here we are thinking

778
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Well you'll just focus on our product

779
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
It reminded us that there's a higher burden on us

780
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
Because we take our products

781
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Really person

782
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
When we think that everyone in every day is going to

783
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Take all the time too

784
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
Explain everything about it the way that

785
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
We the inventor's what

786
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
And that's not always the case that can't be done

787
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
So we realize it

788
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Our job

789
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
It's our job

790
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
To design it in a way that

791
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Today's forecast

792
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
And that's really what

793
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
We started to do a

794
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,016
Do you know when they like how do you know when a toy is going to work

795
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
It's amazing you know really

796
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
I mean we don't have nowhere nada

797
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
I hit driven company

798
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
We joke that we have a lot of singles and doubles

799
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Guido

800
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,120
Really want home runs because we don't want it here today gone tomorrow we're in Evergreen company we want our

801
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Forever

802
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Even when she's working at a product in the new Star owned

803
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,824
Test laboratory with our six children at home is always

804
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
Using rrr products with their own children

805
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,784
I would say the initial ideation I mean you're obviously feeling a good God that you're you have an idea that's going

806
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,112
Going to work and then throughout the process we do a huge

807
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Amount of

808
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
We call it Mom test

809
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Mom is synonymous with

810
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Caregiver dad

811
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
You know anyone who's

812
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Playing teacher

813
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
I am we get

814
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
A good

815
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Sense as we're going through

816
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
The process but the truth is that's the

817
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
Joy of it you never know

818
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
For sure at all and there's surprises everything

819
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Single day

820
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Because

821
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
You start this company in 1988

822
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
10 years really

823
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Before

824
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
The internet starts at

825
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Take off and there was no reason

826
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Why would a

827
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Products and analog toys

828
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,696
So unlikely in fact every reason why they wouldn't

829
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
See you then and I think that's been a part of you note

830
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Except we have a

831
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Model

832
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
I think that's been a part of it all long is

833
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,472
To not go with the tide not go the direction not look at things

834
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,080
That's what everyone is doing that's what we should do because our feeling is always

835
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
If we copy

836
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Every good model out there

837
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
At very best what does that mean

838
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
We're going to be mediocre

839
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
By definition

840
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,832
Because we are simply following and copying whatever one

841
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Elsa's doing

842
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,232
Was there ever a point though so when I don't know like investors or somebody

843
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
Since you guys like you got to do something with batteries we've got to do something that

844
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
You know

845
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
Electronics or something

846
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
They say to us every single tag

847
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
That that's

848
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
And you know that is

849
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,736
One of the things I think that has kept us successful is we stayed true to Mission you know

850
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Ever since we started with our very first puzzle

851
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,696
Did this on your own for pretty much until it

852
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
You are

853
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
A successful company

854
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
But I guess

855
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
Just a few years ago you decided to to

856
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
To see outside

857
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,496
Investors correct significant ownership and we brought in

858
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
Some investors who now will

859
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
Will sit on our board and

860
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Participate very

861
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Actively with us also

862
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
Helpful because the truth is for the first 20 years

863
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
We really did this without mentorship

864
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,600
You know it was literally was finding her own way in a very dark room

865
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
What did the entire investment allow you to

866
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
To do as a company

867
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Well I think

868
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Two things one is they have

869
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
Rolodexes that are much larger than ours and in

870
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Introduce us to Folks at

871
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,448
Can help with things and then financially also

872
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,984
Frankly Freedom 2

873
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,824
Grow and expand more exponentially if we want to

874
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,896
Expand our footprint internationally and so

875
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Open up those doors to

876
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm curious how

877
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
Did you guys I mean obviously if you got I mean

878
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Oceans obviously

879
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
But it seems

880
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Like you have a great relationship

881
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
And

882
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
Your great business partners but also a great

883
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
Kapolei parents if you got kids as well as he can

884
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
What's 6 kids that right

885
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Yep

886
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,216
You were just trying to just trying to figure out how many kids she was going to stay with her first

887
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Oh I was going to say

888
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
If you considered a child

889
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Six children and then.

890
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Stupid like honestly

891
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:22,784
Is it all I can Blissful and joyful and laughing ORD were there moments of tension between the two of you

892
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
You mean this morning or in general

893
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
It's a combination

894
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
The good news is that we

895
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,328
We absolutely do have things that we disagree on which is good and which is healthy

896
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
But I would have to

897
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
To say that I think we have

898
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,240
Our respect and admiration that that keeps it working

899
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Quickly

900
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,568
You know both from a business and a person

901
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
I mean in terms of

902
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,944
The business we never would have been able to make it without it

903
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
I mean this is

904
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
Absolutely

905
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,648
A partnership and a partnership is necessary to go through everything we've gone through I mean this

906
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,464
Although it seems Blissful and easy

907
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Are the 28 years has not been easy and we have faced every challenge imaginable and it goes on and

908
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,264
John everyday Melissa & Doug Bernstein run the toy company

909
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,408
Melissa & Doug the company has grown from just the two of them to almost a thousand employees

910
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,808
With revenue of more than 350 million dollars a year and they still make

911
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:34,208
Lots and lots of puzzles remember the letter puzzle you take the letter out and see

912
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Says that the Puget Sound of the letter and

913
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,608
For some reason one or two letters weren't in the Right Slots

914
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
I fall asleep in my kids room with him

915

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
We specialize in handcrafted wooden bow ties

939
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
Handcrafted wooden bow ties are actually

940
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,768
The wooden bow tie is just like a pre-tied fabric bow tie except for

941
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
This all started for Paul about a year ago when a friend gave him a wooden bow tie is gapped gift if your

942
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,752
Woodworker and you're a preppy guy in high school

943
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,592
But as a woodworker I kind of saw all the flaws in the design

944
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:31,712
So Paul decided I can make a better wooden bow tie one that actually looks

945
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
Less flat and more like real fabric

946
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
Soapy set up a shop in his basement at home

947
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,440
And he started selling the ties on Etsy the greatest compliment that I ever get is

948
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
I didn't know that was a wooden bow tie

949
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,816
And I got that one couldn't even tell

950
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,960
Call has an entire line of bowties now and he figured out how to get wood from all over the world

951
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Maple

952
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288

956
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Some days where it's

957
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Just really crazy

958
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
Inside what I do is I come home at 3 from

959
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
High School

960
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
And then I work till 8 or 9 and then I study from 9 to midnight

961
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
And then

962
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Do it again the next day

963
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
Paul says his company has made about

964
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
$18,000

965
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
And profit

966
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
He's even hired two friends

967
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328

00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448

This is a real family business now

972
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,176
Call plans to go to college next year and he says he's going to run his business from his dorm room but he says

973
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
He's already learning

974
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
It's been

975
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
The greatest learning experience

976
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:44,416
I can almost say that I've learned more from this than I have for my school in the past year that's podcaster from Kansas City Kansas is company
