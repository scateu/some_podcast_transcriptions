Barry Thursday

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,984
Conversation with the

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
The founder of

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Starbucks Howard Schultz

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
My dad how he turned a

9
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Beverage

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Into a destination

11
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,944
So stay tuned for that but in the meantime

12
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,784
Here's one of our favorite episodes from the Hib T archives

13
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
Enjoy

14
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:31,488
You were basically introducing is really low fares were these Airlines trying to match your prices

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
Yes in some cases they were

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,608
And we told the Republic of Texas that

17
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:42,752
You could fly at the lower fare but if you paid the higher Fair we would give you a free bottle of whiskey

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,640
And so for a couple months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Ron NPR how I built this show

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,600
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Stories behind the movement

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm guy Roz and Ali show how an eccentric Texas lawyer

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Turn a crazy idea into Southwest Airlines now one of the biggest airlines in the world

24
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Could you

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,016
Start by introducing yourself to caliber

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
Please can you just say your full name

27
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
This is her

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Kelleher

29
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
And your best known as the

30
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Founder of Southwest Airlines

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
How how old are you

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
85

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Okay great

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Perfect okay

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
We are very excited to talk to you about

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Hamster jumping

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
To imagine that before we really started their interview

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
I had some time to just chit-chat with herb and I learned some interesting things about him like to eat for breakfast

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
Normally for breakfast I have

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Cheese crackers

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
And he likes to drink

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Wild Turkey Bourbon

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
And that he's

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Gas smoker for

45
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Pretty much is entire life

46
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720
I just enjoyed the magical

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Mystikal

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Aroma On Site

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
I'll smoke

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
So how soon after you wake up do you have a

51
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
A cigarette

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Well it's

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
The nanosecond

54
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
That was a quick okay

55
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
Whittier cheese crackers

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,568
Didn't before my cheese crackers

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
That were the story of how herb launched Southwest Airlines 50 years

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
66 to be exact

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
Herb was a young lawyer he's living in San Antonio Texas

60
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,952
Where he had started his own Law Firm helping clients to start company

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
And one day one of her clients got and Rollin King

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Cosmo

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
Pacific Southwest it's lies only in California

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
And I have an idea it looks

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Let's meet for a drink

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
And Rollin

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
Came to me with the idea of setting up a similar operation in Texas

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,968
And and how soon after he sort of floated this idea

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
To you saying let's do it let's start a company

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
It was a very short period of time maybe

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
You know like

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,304
No it was longer than that I was just joking

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
But was that a very short days within days

74
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Within days

75
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
What first I was very skeptical

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
But then I did some research and discovered that PSA was very sad

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Successful in California

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
The Texas

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
Supplies all the requisites for an intrastate Airline

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
Because it was a big state that had large metropolitan areas

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Far enough apart to just

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Justify flying

83
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
And so well Houston Dallas

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
In San Antonio where the obvious first

85
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Target

86
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
Because they were the three larger

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
The cities in Texas

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
What did you know about Airlines it

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,216
Well I knew nothing about Airlines which I think made me eminently qualified

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Start one

91
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
That because what we tried to do at Southwest was

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
Get away from the traditional way that Airlines had done business

93
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
So I started with the tabula rasa blank slate

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
And I think that was very helpful

95
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
So at this point in the how old are you by the way of that

96
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Point in your life

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
I was 35

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
35 okay so you had on your family for children

99
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,327
For children I need to get that the successful Law Firm by lights

100
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Was it with your

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Profitable at that time

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
No it was not notable

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Profitable

104
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
As a matter of fact

105
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Warren Buffett

106
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Reportedly joked about it at one time and said the

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
If a capitalist had shot down the Wright brothers

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
At Kitty Hawk in 1903

109
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
The economy would probably be better off

110
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
And so it didn't have very great return

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
It was constantly in difficulty

112
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Battleship why did you

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,791
You can think that this was a plausible

114
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Idea

115
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Well I think it was for your lure

116
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Of doing something different

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Doing something that was exciting

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
I really always have

119
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Had a great deal of curiosity

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
And then I thought to myself what you know

121
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Mostly adults

122
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
The United States of America

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
Haven't been able to fly because of

124
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
The cost barrier

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,951
It's too expensive it's too expensive they just saw it was business people on expense account

126
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
And so what I'm saying is that

127
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
In terms of

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Market analysis

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
There was a

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Huge

131
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Untappd

132
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
Market for flying out there

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
Okay see you decide with Rollin to start a company was that right

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Then March of the 1967

135
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
But of course that was just a piece of paper

136
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
And we start to receive money

137
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
To the extent of about $500,000

138
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,511
That's a bit was quite a lot of money to raise I guess

139
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
We were set to go to competition

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
At the time Ecuador other airlines

141
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
That we're doing these Texas lights looks like

142
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
Between Houston and Dallas and any other places

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
Oh yeah they proved to be our biggest adversaries because they were not exactly

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Warm welcoming and hospitable we didn't get kisses on both cheeks when we announce that we in

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Intended to

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,439
Create an intrastate carrier sobran of continental and trans-texas later Texas International

147
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Really took out after

148
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
And they kept us involved in

149
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Political fights on

150
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Porch and they just stopped

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
That they would

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
Apply their incumbency

153
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
And the rug

154
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Financial strength

155
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
To bleed Southwest Airlines

156
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Insta death before I could ever fly

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
They were

158
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Suing Southwest Airlines

159
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Correct

160
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
What was their argument what why were they saying you shouldn't operate

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Well joke

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
The argument

163
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Amazing Court

164
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
We're actually all kind of specious

165
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
And this is

166
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Monell's

167
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Expiration of where

168
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
People attempt to use to manipulate the government

169
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
To prevent competition

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
That's what they were up to

171
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
So how long does it take you to fight.

172
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
These legal challenges

173
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Well

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
Between the time when I start working

175
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
On forming Southwest and the time we flew our first flight

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
It was

177
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Four and a half years

178
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
It took a little pertinacity

179
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Yeah

180
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
During that time

181
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Look up me ran out of money

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
And a 1969

183
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
The board of directors

184
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
Had a meeting and talked about shutting

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
They are lying down

186
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Shutting the company down

187
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
And I said well how about if

188
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
I litigate for nothing

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
And pay all the court cost out of my own pocket

190
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,591
Would you be willing to continue under those circumstances and they said

191
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Osher

192
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
So high

193
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
What books have been motivated you to fight for 4 years

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Colossus Airline

195
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
First of all I was idealist

196
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Because I figured

197
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
If they can prevent Southwest Airline

198
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Find some introducing

199
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
What Southwest Airlines

200
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
The Proposal

201
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
To provide to the

202
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Consumer

203
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Then

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
That is

205
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Assign

206
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
That the free enterprise system is failing

207
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
And

208
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
One of the things that motivated me was

209
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
What's 2

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
It is that validate

211
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
The free enterprise system

212
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
And another one was of course that's it was very hot competition and

213
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
I like to win

214
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
For what was that

215
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,999
Like what I don't get is it was such a huge gamble anyway because you you could have spent those four and a half years

216
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Fighting and then winning

217
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
And then Southwest Airlines might have fizzled out anyway

218
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
I'll tell you what guy you put your

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Finger on something

220
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Because

221
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,591
If you had taken a poll in the state of Texas after his father application

222
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
I can show you

223
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
The 99.9%

224
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,319
Of the population of the state of Texas would say this single never come to anything

225
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
I'm very serious about that several people told me that they said

226
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
They were glad to see

227
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
How how much the flight energize met in that I was enjoying it

228
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
But herb don't get yourself it'll never make a dime

229
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Did you ever get Saturday

230
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Depression how did you keep your spirits

231
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
Wild turkey helped provide a little boost

232
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
But frankly my spirits

233
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Just don't get down

234
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
I don't

235
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Stress very easily

236
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
I'll give you an example

237
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
They have stress classes

238
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Was it Southwest Airlines years ago many years ago

239
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
And up

240
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
They invited me to come over and speak

241
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Yeah I was a felt it was running to class at 7

242
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
He said to the class you said we know

243
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Herb undergoes

244
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
A lot of stress all the time

245
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
Hotel the class how do you handle it and I said

246
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
I don't have that I liked it

247
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
That was the last time I was asked back to the clap

248
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
So

249
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
So you mean what you were going

250
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
In and out of court

251
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
For 4 years

252
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
How are you making a living at

253
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Well I'm still practicing law

254
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,463
I mean I was doing a lot of other things during that time which led to very long weeks

255
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
Walmart occasion I was in the law office for two full days

256
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
And

257
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,751
At the end of those two full days I've went home shaved and 1/2 a fundraising dinner for Southwest Airlines

258
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
But that's kind of the

259
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
The perseverance that it demanded

260
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,735
To help get Southwest Airline started while still practicing law

261
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
I'm doing many other things

262
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
So what happened on the court with the

263
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Southwest Gas

264
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
It went

265
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Through the United States

266
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Supreme Court

267
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
And through the Texas Supreme Court twice

268
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Before we could fly

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
And the Texas

270
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Supreme Court handed down

271
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
An order

272
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
19 hours prior to our first flight

273
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
When was that

274
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Well that was a 19th June of 1971

275
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
We start flying on June 18th 1971 what was the flight where they go

276
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
The first flight

277
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Want some Dallas

278
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
San Antonio

279
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
But the one that received all the publicity went from Dallas to Houston

280
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,767
And we were the underdog it was sort of David versus the Goliath you know not just one but three of them

281
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
So there was a lot of news coverage

282
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
About it and that's the reason people paid a lot of

283
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Attention

284
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
2 is finally getting underway

285
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
Were you on that first flight by the way

286
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
No I wasn't I was busy working to make sure there was the second flight

287
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
Do you remember that day that that first lytic often

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Remember why you feel that you feel like

289
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,647
Finally this is done so it was wonderful. I'll tell you the experience I had

290
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
When the first airplane came in

291
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,047
It was over a in Fort Worth American Tanger

292
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
So I went over there and there's this airplane

293
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
After four and a half years

294
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Stuck my head

295
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
In the back of one of the engines

296
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
And mechanic gravity

297
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
Hold me back and you said you realize that

298
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
Thrust reverser goes off

299
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
It will decapitate you and I said at this moment I don't give a damn

300
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
So at this point Southwest Airlines start

301
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Advertising it starts

302
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,655
Flying many Ripple with it was a flying more than one route was it flying multiple routes

303
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
What was Dallas Houston Houston San Antonio and San Antonio Dallas

304
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Do one of those legs

305
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
Well on some flights we had the fares as low as $10

306
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
Those we had

307
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
There's as low as 15 or $20

308
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
We were about

309
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
45% lower

310
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Then the other carrier

311
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
So how are you able to do that how are you able to

312
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Recharge

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
So much

314
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Such a lower fare than the other

315
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
At through enormous productivity

316
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
But but how I mean I'm assuming you a few planes

317
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
What we start out with three

318
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And then we got a fourth one

319
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
We had to get rid of one airplane in order to meet our payroll

320
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Right after Southwest start flying and so

321
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
We decided

322
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
That we would fly a for airplane schedule with three airplane how you do that

323
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
Ten-minute turns at the gate

324
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,767
We bring that airplane in and 10 minutes after

325
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Stopped at the gate

326
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Ditto

327
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
It would be pushing back again

328
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,959
And we had airplanes that univer operating

329
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
12 hours a day sometimes so each one of those additional flights

330
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
Representative Revenue generation off

331
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Opportunity that the other cars didn't have

332
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
Okay but even so I mean those other carriers

333
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Like braniff and Texas International right

334
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
They were charging

335
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,231
Much much higher fares and it couldn't just been that you turn to plans around faster

336
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,303
No the whole conversation you're right about that

337
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
I was just giving you an example

338
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,935
Out with the ten-minute turn because it's a vivid one

339
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Addition to that

340
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
They've whereby definition monopolist

341
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
They had been under 40 years

342
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Federal government super

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Revision through the c a b

344
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
That the Civil aeronautics

345
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Explore yes right

346
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
And during that time

347
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
If they had a little thing Angel problem

348
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
Of the cab would just give them a fare increase

349
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
I hope so

350
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
That's how their fares got so high

351
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
As compared to what we were doing

352
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
Since we were regulated by the c a b

353
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
Okay see you weren't regulated in the same way but

354
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
What were you doing other things like

355
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Lake peigneur employees less

356
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Well it dependent initially

357
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
We were paying them less

358
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
As the years went on

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
We were paying them or their total compensation

360
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
I was superior to the other carriers and in addition

361
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,671
When we turned our first very slim profit in 1973

362
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
We set up the first

363
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Profit sharing plan

364
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
In the American airline industry

365
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
And I think they made a profit of I don't know I'm $2,000 that year or something like that

366
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
But that would honor course

367
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Toopoor billion

368
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
Enter employees pocket

369
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
And your employees were

370
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Were you nice as well

371
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Yeah we were the most heavily unionized

372
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Carrier in the United

373
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
States

374
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
Are low-cost were not due to being a non-union carrier

375
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Since we were

376
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
More unionized than our competitors were

377
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
You were basic

378
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Introducing is really low fares

379
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Woody's Airlines trying to match your prices

380
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Yes in some cases they were

381
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
There's no question about that as a matter of fact braniff at one point

382
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
Put in a lower fare than air

383
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
What's it called an introductory Thayer course they've been serving Texas you know for 40 years by that time but it any of that

384
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
One of the things that came out of that was

385
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
We maintained our full fares

386
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
And we told the Republic of Texas that if you paid the higher fare

387
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
We would give you a free bottle of whiskey

388
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,631
And so for a couple of months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

389
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
About flying at that time with

390
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
If a madman and you know

391
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Tumblr

392
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Sky auction

393
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,527
Glamorous experience with Southwest was competing on price mean you will not

394
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
You were not doing in fly cocktails

395
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
Like what do people think of your service versus the competition

396
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
God I got a story to tell you on that

397
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,327
It was Thanksgiving of 1971 remember we've been in business since June

398
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Yep

399
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
And my sister-in-law

400
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,703
Delightful lady called Nathan Myra law

401
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
And she said her butt

402
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,615
She said I just flew from Houston to San Antonio on Southwest Airlines and

403
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
I've traveled most of the world's Airlines which was true

404
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
You know she was a world Traveler

405
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
And she said I know you're going to be a big success

406
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:01,439
You got the best in-flight service that I have ever experienced on any Airline

407
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
And I said

408
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Am I glad to hear that how many passengers were on there play she said just me

409
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
In just a minute Southwest

410
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,943
Goes National and Herb convinces Travelers that Airlines do not have to serve in-flight meals

411
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
I'm gyros near listening to how I built this

It's how I built this from NPR

And I Rise

437
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:46,911
1970s Southwest Airlines only fly within the state of Texas

438
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
In 1978

439
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Something really important have

440
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
Congress decides to completely deregulate the airline industry

441
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
And for Southwest Airlines

442
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
That means

443
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
They can now start flying to new cities

444
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Outside of Texas

445
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
At this point you Southwest is expanding and your competitors are no longer just taxes are lies you're competing with

446
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
American and

447
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
And and and Pan Am and TWA right National major International carriers

448
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,263
So we're people skeptical that Southwest will be able to compete in

449
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
In the big leagues

450
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Oh yes

451
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
We were described as

452
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
The Texas Airline that could only be

453
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Successful in

454
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
The state of Texas

455
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Okay

456
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
And then we were described as a

457
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Sunbelt Airline

458
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
They could not be successful outside

459
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
The Sunbelt

460
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
There was a

461
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Press conference for winning the Baltimore

462
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Where were the reporters there said that

463
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,703
Waiting on mr. Larry said I know you've been very successful out west but

464
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
Now you're coming to the east

465
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
The most competitive

466
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
Part of the country as far as Airline Services concerned

467
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
And I said yeah

468
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,479
It's so competitive that when we start out here

469
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,063
We're reducing your existing fares by 60%

470
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
How competitive does that sound at that time

471
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
Were you guys already serve No Frills

472
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
What we were no frills we're in the sense that we were short hole

473
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
And I got a restriction

474
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
What you can do you have relatively short flight till like peanuts

475
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,727
Drinks

476
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
That sort of thing but you know

477
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
When we start flying long haul lights

478
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
From San Antonio to Los Angeles

479
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Where to press conference

480
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
You know to announce a new service

481
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
And

482
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
One of the

483
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
Reporters there said

484
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Well you going to serve

485
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
Meals on those flights and I said no we're not

486
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
We're going to charge you $400 less

487
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Per trip

488
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Right

489
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,375
And I understand you can get a pretty good sandwich at Jason's for $400

490
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
So when I would Point did you give up your life right

491
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
Actually that was at the request of board director

492
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
1981

493
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
Can you were still you still had your own law practice that you were doing other work for

494
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
Throughout the entire 1970s

495
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Oh yes yeah

496
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,343
And I'll tell you the truth you know I didn't really hang her

497
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
The bee bar corporate life

498
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Because

499
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,280
Little boys have a lot more freedom to do their own thing when and where they want to

500
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,400
But we hired a very excellent fellow named Lamar Muse who was the real battler

501
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
To get the company off the ground in operation

502
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
He had substantial Airline experience

503
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Bad. He did a wonderful job

504
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,432
And so you don't find me a 1981 we lost

505
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Successor to Lamar

506
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
And the board director said to me you've got to do it and did you want to do it I felt I had to do it

507
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,952
And I'll tell you why because the start of the 1980

508
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,536
You had unemployment of 10.8%

509
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
You had a double-dip recession

510
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
You had the air traffic controllers strike

511
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Then Lamar Muse

512
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
The guy we had to get the cut me off the ground he launched competitor against just gold Muse hair

513
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
He left Southwest and then launched a competitor

514
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
Yep that's 3 years after he left gold news there be filled out that well I thought it was some Modern modest on his paw

515
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
But because he called muser after himself

516
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,352
We work together all these years and now you're done

517
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,936
We bought him later and later

518
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
Yeah when they're on the verge of bankruptcy

519
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
We bought news there

520
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
But it was there

521
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
The 1981

522
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,688
So I figured I'd better do what the board asked me to do

523
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
And come to Southwest Airlines

524
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Full-time

525
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
I was making money at the time

526
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Yes

527
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,184
We've been profitable every single year

528
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
For 43 years I guess now

529
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,096
You must be the other airlines crazy because they were

530
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
A lot of them

531
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Have had good years

532
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
And that ears

533
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
But it seems like Southwest is just

534
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Has never had a

535
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Bad here

536
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
What we've had years when

537
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
You know earnings were down

538
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,920
But we've never had a loss for a full year

539
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Since

540
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
22

541
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
And we've never throw those an employee at Southwest Airlines when the rest of the industry during that. Up until

542
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Has probably furloughed I don't know

543
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
A million-and-a-half employees

544
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Throughout the world

545
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Basically

546
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
We

547
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
Look at history and said this is a very dicey

548
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
The business to be at

549
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
Delta Airline business

550
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Yeah

551
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,824
So we may be flamboyant from the marketing standpoint but we're going to be very conservative from V

552
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Google stand for

553
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
And

554
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
Established

555
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
A rule of thumb

556
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
That we're going to pay 80% of the cost

557
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
List of all brand new airplanes from internally generated funds

558
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
And actually weld up 100%

559
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Hermosa airplane so we had

560
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
The largest

561
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Percentage

562
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
In our Fleet of owned airplane

563
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Of any carrier of any size

564
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
So so

565
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
What does that mean

566
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Well I mean

567
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
You're not taking on that

568
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
Right when you do that

569
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,872
So when you get in the bad times you're not threatened by the debt payments

570
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,760
Which is put cameras into bankruptcy and out of bankruptcy and back into bankruptcy you know for

571
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
35 years

572
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
You heard from from the outside from listen to stories

573
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
The airline industry

574
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Seems so

575
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,072
Brutally is it do you think it's more Savage than than other Industries

576
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
I think

577
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,680
That it's more competitive than other end

578
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Mysteries

579
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
And one of the reasons for that is

580
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
That our principal Capital assets

581
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
The airplanes

582
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Moovit 540 miles an hour

583
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah

584
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
And you know if you have a shoe factory

585
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
The fails in Seattle as an example

586
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
You can't

587
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,184
Within hours transport that chew Factory 2

588
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
Chattanooga Tennessee to compete there

589
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
But if

590
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,352
Your Seattle Air Service fails you can have your airplanes

591
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
In San Antonio or Chattanooga

592
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Within a matter of hours so

593
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
The very mobility of your Capital asset

594
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
Breeds a lot of competition

595
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,152
Did you like that competition. Did you like

596
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Being an airline CEO and

597
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Lighting Alexa

598
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
Was it fun for you

599
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
Well I have to adopt my son

600
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Yeah I love being with the people at Southwest Airlines

601
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
That was like a fountain of youth

602
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
For me

603
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
They were so wonderful and entertaining and

604
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Ghetto

605
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Great to be with

606
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
That part of it

607
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
But

608
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
When your pricing lawyer pretty much

609
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Do Your Own Thing

610
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
And

611
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
It's a swift Pace wealth

612
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
Things to move as swiftly at first

613
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
What I came to Southwest Airlines full-time and

614
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
We're moving swiftly compared to the rest of the

615
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Airline industry

616
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
But not compared to my experience

617
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,928
Were you pushing for expansion and growth and all those things

618
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Stringer tender

619
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh yes I mean Southwest Airlines

620
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Expanded enormously

621
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
You know something very small base

622
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
But I soon realized

623
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
It was a speech

624
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
That I want to hear

625
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,056
We're of a guru said if you can improve a corporation five four

626
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
Percent in a year that's a mirror

627
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Oh okay I was trying to do 25%

628
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Maybe that's why I feel a little frustrated

629
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,392
So it really brought my thinking you know more in line

630
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
Even if it might have seemed like a

631
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
It was a slow process for you

632
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
The fact that Southwest was growing and

633
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
Cat prevailed in this Industries is pretty remarkable as pretty unbelievable

634
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,568
Given that you know so many of those early competitors don't even exist anymore and some of the Great

635
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Hainan airlines

636
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
TWA

637
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Can-Am

638
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
Exactly many of them

639
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
There are very few left

640
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
What mistakes did they make that you seem not to have made

641
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Well

642
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
We just did things

643
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Differently

644
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Black Market

645
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
You know what Shiva

646
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Supposed

647
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,304
And I told anybody say

648
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Mansion Market

649
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Picture I punch him in the nose

650
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
Because here all these big companies fighting over their Market

651
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
Share and losing money and following employees

652
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Let's focus on profitability

653
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:33,504
And if we have 4% of the market were profitable that's better than having 90% of the market

654
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
And being uncooperative

655
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
What's the value of Southwest

656
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Overall

657
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh

658
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Probably

659
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
20 billion dollar something like that

660
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,352
One of the biggest

661
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
Airlines in the United

662
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
At in the world

663
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
In terms of passengers

664
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
Sunbelievable

665
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah

666
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
It really is

667
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
It's like I've had too much Wild Turkey

668
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Fantasizing

669
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Weather when you start of the company

670
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,528
How much how much did you invest

671
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Personally

672
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
I invested $10,000

673
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Which must be worth quite a bit today

674
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
Imagine if well it's going up some

675
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Since then

676
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
But

677
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
That's a company

678
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
That's what I thought was

679
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Requirement

680
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
Of good leadership

681
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
I was turned down pay increases

682
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Bonus increase

683
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
To set a good example

684
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
I thought for all of our people

685
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Corsa stock that I got

686
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,456
Rose enormously in value but that was in lieu of cash compensation

687
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
SeaWorld

688
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Mainly paid with

689
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Woodstock hops

690
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,136
Yeah basically was socket I got to do is kick out just to give an Exemplar

691
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
When I did the stock option deal

692
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,768
In lieu of pay raises was our Pilots to look at Southwest Airlines

693
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
Stock options

694
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
In lieu of a pay increase

695
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
I took no pay increase

696
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Along with them

697
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm not trying to single anybody out but

698
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
There was a

699
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,640
The head of an airline that was smaller than Southwest Airlines and on the verge

700
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Going out of business

701
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,296
Do salary and bonus for three times what mine were at Southwest Airlines and that's the way I wanted it

702
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,672
Are you from worried that some you know some young you know

703
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
Herb Keller type

704
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,792
Characters going to come around and put up some upstart Airline and knock Southwest APA

705
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Spectrum

706
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
You concerned about it all the time

707
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
I wrote a letter to her employees

708
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
And

709
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,544
It was about my 10 for most concerns for the next decade of Southwest Airline

710
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
That's okay yeah

711
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
And

712
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Number one

713
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
Was us

714
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
That we ignore competition

715
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
That we get complaints

716
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
That way

717
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Get cocky

718
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,904
And I used to line thinks Mullinax volume will get bigger

719
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
Think they can act big and will get smaller

720
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
So could happen one day

721
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
So it's possible

722
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
You know I'm up

723
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
History buff

724
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
And if you look at the largest companies

725
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
And United States

726
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
As the 19th century

727
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
We turned into the 20th

728
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Most of them are gone

729
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
The central leather company

730
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
+ 1900 + 1901

731
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Was the 17th largest

732
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
This company in the United States

733
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
But it didn't anticipate

734
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,904
What the Advent of the Ford automobile

735
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Was going to me

736
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
You know what it did

737
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
It made buggy whips and saddle

738
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
And never stop doing it until it was gone

739
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
And if you look at countries

740
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Boys look at company

741
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
They perish

742
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
If you have any sense of History

743
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
You realize that and

744
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
You don't try to avoid it

745
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:46,016
If you're in the story of how you made this happen and all the work you put into it

746
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
I wonder if you think your

747
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Chicken wire differin

748
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
To be able to

749
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
Put up with all that stuff for so many years

750
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,744
Well I said yeah I probably am wired a little bit

751
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,864
Currently some for many people and they're probably very happy about that difference himself

752
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
What are the things that

753
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
I never look back

754
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
You know I don't spend a lot of time regretting things

755
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
That went wrong

756
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
And furthermore

757
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
I think

758
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
I've always had a great deal of fun

759
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
Out of what I was doing

760
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
And you know

761
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,856
People would say to me why don't you why don't you burned-out yeah

762
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
You know I was working 100 hours a week

763
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Loveland / simplywell

764
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
It's easy

765
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,608
When you have a passionate joy and what you're doing you don't burn out

766
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
Herb Kelleher co-founded Southwest Airlines 50 years ago

767
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
And he served as CEO and then I'm bored

768
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
Before retiring in 2008

769
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Featherweight herb Kelleher once

770
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,552
It was all a trademark dispute with a rival airline are both using the slogan

771
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Planesmart

772
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
He was all this not in court

773
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
But the challenging the other CEO

774
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
To a public arm wrestling match

775
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
Which herb Kelleher law

776
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
You can see that entire arm wrestling match

777
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
Just go to Google and type in analysis

778
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

792
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,712
Time now for how you built that and this big story comes to us from Monica mizrachi

793
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
San Diego California years ago was packing

794
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,416
To go overseas on a gap year

795
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,304
She was going to be traveling to 14 different countries which meant that she was going to be living out of a suitcase

796
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
So we needed to find the system where she would be very organized in her travels to be able to survive out of us

797
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Suitcase pretty much for the year

798
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:20,128
Okay this for me or maybe even you know we can just throw a bunch of clothes into a suitcase

799
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,992
Forget about it but Monica she is incredibly organized

800
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
I was a mathematician College

801
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
And I was

802
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
What was burning to order

803
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:36,256
Lakeland math is one solution but when it came to packing I just couldn't find the system we try

804
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,656
With Ziploc bags we tried many other packing Cubes but you couldn't see your things

805
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,752
I wanted to turn a suitcase into a set of drawers

806
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
And what money I came up with was a modular set of clear squishy plastic cubes that you can

807
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,944
Could stack inside a suitcase

808
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
And pull out by handle when you open your suitcase you can see everything on your suitcase and eventually

809
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
Monica ran into a friend at a barbecue

810
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,768
Who happened to work with factories in China so of course she showed him her plans

811
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,072
Then he says this looks really interesting

812
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
Then he took it to China

813
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,008
Penny made of prototype for me if I told him I wanted to clear and Wanda piping I wanted to have a handle

814
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
And he made

815
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
The first prototype

816
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,640
Soon after that Marcus scrape together some money

817
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
And placed an order for 14

818
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
Thousand of these packing cubes

819
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
And a few months later

820
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,832
A truck driver pulled up in front of her house

821
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,160
I thought I was getting maybe 50 boxes or something

822
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
We had a

823
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
20ft Container full of boxes on them like

824
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
Oh my God what

825
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Did we do

826
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,960
And that was the precise moment when Monica realized she'd forgotten one very

827
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Crucial detail

828
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,824
She had not gotten the word out about the packing cubes

829
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,664
No I didn't have a single client I haven't sold a single Q

830
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,272
Fortunately her son Solomon had studied business and marketing in college

831
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
So he stepped in and he said mom said we are going to work really hard we're going to put it online and we're going to

832
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
How to sell it

833
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,840
So Solomon started to email Mommy bloggers about the cubes and one of them posted it on Pinterest

834
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
And sure enough he says we're just got you know

835
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Six or seven orders in like that was a big deal at the time that was like wow like this is working you know

836
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,200
And he actually liked the idea so much that two years ago Solomon bought the company you from his mom

837
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,248
Eddie called it easy packing

838
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,600
She still helps out with the accounting and her husband does the legal work

839
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
And her other kids how about you but

840
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Solomon

841
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
How does the

842
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Bulk of the work

843
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
You know what it's been an amazing honor

844
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
To work with my son I never thought I would work with my son

845
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,656
If it hadn't been for him I would not have been able to do it

846
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
