How I built this

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
Stories behind the movements

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,024
They go

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
Turn flower bouquets into fruit bouquets

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
And after that

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Delta multi-million dollar franchise

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Edible

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,128
Okay so say you're an investor

25
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
And someone pictures you

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Concept 2

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
Sell cool glasses online

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
Like Warby Parker

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
Or a ride hailing

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Like Lyft

31
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,416
Or even a new type of women's undergarment like Spanx

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
You could imagine thinking

33
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Yeah this might have a chance to take you out right

34
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
What are some one pitch to a business idea to take camel open

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Pineapples

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Strawberries

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Carve them into

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
Flower shapes

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
And arrange them into bouquets

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
Would you jump at that

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Because

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
Be honest if I were an investor 20 years ago

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
And Tariq Farid

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,832
Hitched that idea to me there is no way I would have taken it seriously

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
And as you will hear

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
Back when he first pitched it

47
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Almost no one else did

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Which is why in some ways

49
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,584
Today's episode is one of our most mind-blowing because

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Tariq Farid had convinced himself

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
His intuition was right

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,288
And he defied almost everyone to build a franchise at today

53
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
That's more than a half a billion dollars

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Annual revenue

55
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,200
But even more inspiring is how it all started

56
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
Because I tell the age of 12

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Tariq barely spoke English

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
His parents took the family from Pakistan

59
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Yuan to the US

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
In 1981

61
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
For a better life

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
They settled in West Haven

63
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Connecticut

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Antarctic dad got a job

65
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
At a machine shop during the day

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
And to make a little extra

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
You work the night shift

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
At Burger King

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
What happened in a few months after their arrival

70
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Park realize

71
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
Just how tight money was

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
During a trip to the grocery

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
And my mother saw mango

74
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
And she was holding up mangoes

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
You know what we should buy some for

76
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
For the kids and they're like a dollar something each of my father looks seven

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Sonos soundbar

78
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
WeChat

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Dollar each

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
And this was a father who used

81
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Cases

82
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
I'm in Pakistan you know we never had to leave you would do would eat until

83
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Your stomach hurt

84
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
And that's why I realize the things that change

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
And I remember that moment that

86
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Idyllwild

87
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
My father cataffo

88
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Ford a piece of

89
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
And I have to help him at that point I never asked

90
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
And I started to

91
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Kitchen

92
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
What kind of things did you do

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
So

94
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Paper route

95
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Villager News

96
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
In the summer months I would go to my

97
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
My father's machine shop

98
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
And then

99
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
You know I had a

100
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
A group of people that I clean their yards

101
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Cut their lawn

102
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
Remove there snow

103
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
And then the

104
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
The flower shop

105
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
And that's probably the most in

106
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
Tell me about that

107
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
How old were you when you started working flower shop

108
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
30

109
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
So

110
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
I used to deliver papers as Charlie

111
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Italian and Charlie's

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Those amazing eyes

113
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Nori's

114
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Always to deliver paper

115
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
Crystal and might one day my brother just asked some

116
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
That Charlie

117
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Are you looking for someone to water plants or

118
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Can we help and I think Charlie felt

119
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Charlie Charlie the owner of the

120
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
The flower shop

121
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,095
And he said you know what I need some help taking some flowers across

122
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
To the cemetery or watering the plants yet come on down

123
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Come down a few days a week and do some

124
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Thing and keep yourself

125
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
And that's why I started to

126
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
Work at the fair Sally's flower shop

127
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Ana west

128
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Haven Connecticut

129
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
And it was just watering the plants helping the customers

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Taking orders

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Bringing up thing

132
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
But the biggest thing was I was in the shadow of an amazing

133
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
End

134
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
He taught you how to do all the stuff

135
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Not only taught me how to do that

136
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
But the genius of

137
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
This man was that

138
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,703
He would kind of have you follow when he would go and help a customer he would have you follow and he was to

139
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Just amazed

140
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
So I learned

141
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Just by shadowing him

142
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Walking around with

143
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
Did you

144
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Did you run the register did you make arrangements

145
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
The flower arrangements what are the things to do in the flower shop

146
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
I did everything

147
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,903
You know I've never really worried about what I'm doing I worry more about how I'm

148
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
So I wanted to

149
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Press Charlie that I can

150
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Good job

151
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
And Charlie was amazing at

152
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Lemon said he might when my father would come to

153
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Pick me up a drum to the car and it says you have a good kid Harry know he's a hard worker he's going to be good easy to make it easy to do something

154
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
And I just wanted those comp

155
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Not only ran the register you know I would go and try to do things on my own so he knows he can

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Count On Me

157
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
I would help people make flower bouquets and everything so by the time I was 13-14 I knew every

158
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,671
Three aspects of the outdoor plants out of water them hefei

159
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
What are some help customers there's a fourteen-year-old who's telling someone if you like them

160
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
Wow you're smart enough

161
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
And that pretty much started the entrepreneurial Journey

162
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Did you continue to work in that

163
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Flower shop throughout

164
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Middle School

165
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
The second-year middle school I got a job at Burger King

166
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Endorphin

167
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Connecticut

168
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
The Burger King my father work

169
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,087
I can work all weekend I can make a lot of money because most of the money went to helping the

170
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Family

171
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,183
When will you serve handing over your tracks to your

172
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Two parents

173
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Yes

174
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Best

175
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
So you spent you know your middle school and high school

176
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
You know you were spending that

177
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Working like working at

178
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
McDonald's Burger King or

179
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Paper route or

180
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Flower shop

181
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Which obviously had a big impression on you

182
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
And then I guess at

183
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Around 8:17

184
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Flower shop winner for sale in your town

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
So my father

186
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
Since I worked at the flower shop he would always look

187
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
For businesses and I remember him

188
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Taking me to a Subway franchise

189
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439

192
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
They presented why you should

193
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Be a Subway franchise

194
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Taking their and there was just too expensive

195
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
We looked at in a week

196
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
We could afford it and then he saw an ad in the paper

197
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,823
For a flower shop for sale but it wasn't the flower shop for sale beside the flower shop have gone out of business

198
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
And they were selling their equipment and I think

199
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Clothes for $6,000

200
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
And he said to look at the flower shop for sale we should go check it out and I went checked it out

201
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
If you was a time that you never said

202
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,927
I didn't know anything about it I worked at a flower shop he assumed that

203
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Because I work.

204
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Probably run one

205
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Solo

206
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
This could be good and we can afford this is only 6000

207
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
You want to do it and I said sure let's do it

208
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
What is the sea

209
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Everything

210
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
What's a cooler in

211
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Powder and

212
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Refrigeration

213
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
Some inventory but it had been shut down for a while

214
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
And my father borrowed $6,000 from

215
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
Denise and Bill Holberg Hoover

216
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
His boss

217
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,927
Next thing you know we we owned the shop and it was just mostly the equipment is what we bought

218
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
We ended up

219
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Convincing the landlord

220
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Was it a pretty good location

221
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
I don't even know the

222
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Shouldn't be a good location it was probably not it it probably went out of his

223
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
It wasn't

224
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
Location it was at a busy intersection and

225
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
And it was hidden it was Tiny was about 600 square feet

226
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
The tiny little flower shop

227
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
It was perfect

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Depressed because it's something we could

229
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
400000

230
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
1000 es6

231
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
It didn't really matter where was

232
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Yasso with the $6,000

233
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
You have the store

234
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
And then what did you just start

235
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,791
I mean what did you actually do when once you sign the deal with the

236
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
But the guy selling you the shop

237
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
Made my first mistake

238
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
That's what I did you know somebody

239
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
That's why it was the first holiday was

240
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Easter and I had never been to

241
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
To wholesale

242
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Never I didn't know where Charlie bought

243
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Flowers are what he got

244
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,455
So I looked up how to buy the flowers where we get them

245
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
Back then the nice thing was it was Yellow Pages for every

246
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,855
The end of found a wholesaler that I went to emboss

247
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,207
So I think I had like $600 that we had kind of saved up for

248
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Initial inventory

249
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
For Easter

250
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
And I went and bought

251
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
The flowers and I didn't know what to buy on

252
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
And it was Mister

253
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Caprotti who owns

254
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
Perrotti's wholesale flowers in in New Haven

255
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
I'll who kind of pointed me in the right direction to say you know you got to buy the pinks and the blues and

256
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,175
And the lighter pastel colors that Easter buy some tulips do this do that any kind of drugs me because he saw

257
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
I didn't know what I was doing so we got to help me out yeah

258
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
He directs me I pay him cash and pay good luck kid

259
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
And off I go

260
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Show up at the shop

261
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
The cooler was shut down for a long time and I'm looking at the coup

262
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
Cooler and I don't know what temperature

263
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
You should be set back

264
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Back then there was no Google

265
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Flowers temperature

266
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,143
So I am looking at it and it has a one

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
And it has cooler and

268
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Coldest or something like that and it was one

269
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
M39

270
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
And I'm thinking you know I want these flowers to do

271
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Do well

272
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
But I didn't know that

273
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
The cooler had a freezer

274
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Put the flowers in made all the arrangements got ready for

275
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
For Easter

276
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
When home came back the next day everything in the

277
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Frozen because I had turned it on freeze

278
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
Temperature

279
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
That was the only money I had

280
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
So here I am I'm trying to revive the flowers.

281
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,375
I mean I didn't know you can't revive them trying to get him into a we know what room temperature water and see if I can save them

282
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
I can't so I show up at Mr

283
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Perotti's wholesale

284
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
He knows I just bought the stuff yesterday

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
So you like what you sell out and I'm embarrassed

286
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Tell him then I'm like

287
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Spanish omelette

288
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:29,247
Stop and I'm picking a few things out and he notices that I pick a few things because I don't have that much money I only have

289
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
A hundred a hundred something that I got from my pee

290
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Endyne Eagles what happened

291
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
And I told him what happened he got a laugh and he said just take whatever you

292
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
Go take pics of stuff and pay me whenever you can

293
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
You're good for it

294
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
And that was probably the most amazing kindness to some

295
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
Solicit

296
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Incredible

297
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Chico back and Preserve

298
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
You said it to the right

299
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
The right temperature

300
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,871
How do you get customers to come into the door

301
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
I learned a lot from Charlie

302
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
Set that you it's all about customer service. I know I didn't see Charlie advertise I don't know anything about advertising what I did see you

303
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Was the great customer service he did

304
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487
So we put up a banner outside get some specials

305
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,607
I think it'll be the people that come to you if you understand the custom

306
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,727
Most people want to impress or want to while someone so that's what I always focused

307
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,871
Don that have things that I know will sell and people would really like and make them in such a way that

308
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Impressive

309
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
So we would make the

310
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Beds have the flower book

311
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Okay then

312
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
And make it real easy for the customer

313
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,647
The one thing we did I looked around at what flower shops did and everybody close by 5

314
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
Hawkeye State open till 7:38

315
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,535
And then we started to get a lot of customers coming home after work

316
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,887
And they would say I'm glad you're open late because I needed something that I couldn't get to the shop anyway

317
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
It was closed

318
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
All the shops are

319
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,519
The clothes so we started to do more and more of that that I would be open very late

320
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
And then the other thing was

321
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
So you started to get regular customer

322
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
And what does regular customer

323
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
You started to feel

324
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Figure out what they like

325
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
And what works

326
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
And so what

327
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
What what do they like what were you doing

328
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,391
Well I remember about a year in that there was this gentleman that

329
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Used to come to us and that he's to buy

330
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
Flowers for his fiance every week

331
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
At about six months in

332
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,631
He comes in and he goes we're getting married and we want you to do our wedding and

333
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
And I I was honest I said I am sorry

334
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Never done a wedding

335
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,799
And I remember you know just an amazing guy

336
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,895
He goes to me why I never been married before 2 so we're both in the same boat don't worry about it

337
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
It will figure it out

338
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
And it was a large order I mean it was a couple of thousand

339
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Dollars

340
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
And I remember doing that

341
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Along the way

342
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Learning every aspect that never been to a church

343
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
Before I didn't know what a alter is or

344
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
I'll run a resort or these

345
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
You know the carpet to lay down and everything but

346
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Once we did that then after that

347
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
At the wedding

348
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
Became really big because another day was something that we did

349
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Good and we had a reference

350
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Who work there who actually random

351
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Besides you

352
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
So I was in high school so

353
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
The first person that ever worked there was my

354
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
And also my mom

355
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Released

356
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
The foundation of a

357
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,767
My mom would kind of wake up early in the morning get all the kids ready

358
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
BEFORE school

359
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,911
And by 8 you know if I would drop her off we had one car I drop her off at the shop

360
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
And then she kind of knew what to watch he didn't speak

361
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
English but she would

362
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
Watch the shop and then I hired an another

363
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Employee to take the orders

364
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
I come back at 1

365
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
They would have

366
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
The orders ready I would

367
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Take the orders and then I would go out on delivery so that happen

368
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
The first five or six

369
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
I couldn't really afford to pay anyone

370
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Except that one person that would take

371
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Take the orders in the morning and she had kids

372
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
So I have to be back by 1

373
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
So she could go back

374
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
For kids and then I would

375
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
How soon after you opened up

376
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
The flower shop where you

377
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
You profitable

378
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
I think

379
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Breaking even or making some money we started

380
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Going to do that within five to six

381
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
Six months because you never really had a value for how much

382
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
Get yourself you just saw that at the end some monies

383
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
And as long as there was some money left and there was a prophet

384
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
You did well but

385
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
What we did really good with us at the holidays were

386
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:24,255
I always focused on bringing customers back for Mother's Day and Christmas and Valentine's Day

387
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
And they always came back and that's when you really made the money

388
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,447
Services like 1988-89 87-88

389
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
End

390
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
What's the score

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
Start a hit its tribe did you think about expanding

392
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Right away blow open the second store in Milford

393
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Connecticut and how did you guys come up with

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
I remember writing a business plan

395
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
For a flower shop back

396
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
And what going to the bank

397
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Say that I hate when I open this app

398
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,255
Quick $120,000 I need and I did a business planning

399
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Presented it to the bank

400
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
And of course they denied

401
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
BBQ Emerson you were like

402
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
1918 years old when he went to the bank asking for money

403
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
About 18

404
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Show images

405
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
You can't really blame them for not wanting to buy $20,000

406
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
I and I don't

407
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
What would you do then

408
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
I had to go back to plan B which was

409
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Go buy something you can afford in

410
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
It's probably run down in it and it probably have to build

411
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
From scratch

412
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
How much was that second job

413
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Cost about $70,000

414
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
It was a

415
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Everybody was out fully

416
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Functional shop

417
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
But it was a note that

418
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
The older house so he said I'll give you a loan you just pay me every month

419
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
I think I paid them off within a year

420
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Going to half a year

421
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Wow and by then

422
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
I had moved on to a third project

423
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
I computerized

424
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
My first shop when you say computer eyes

425
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
What do you mean

426
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
What a POS

427
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
What point of sale system

428
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
Cuz it was done all by paper

429
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Up until that point

430
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Everything was

431
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,327
This was a single IBM PC you would buy everything was on floppy disks back then

432
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
And we were just an 88 starting to get into hard drives

433
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,543
And so I put in a Novell networking and the reason I ended up putting it in myself was it I wanted to computerized my first flower shop

434
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,895
I wanted to put a POS system and bring in the wire service

435
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Computers

436
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
And it was just so expensive it would people to come in at

437
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
$12,000 for Novell networking

438
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Bill cost this much

439
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
And I just started

440
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
To play around with the myself and I put in the system

441
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
The myself

442
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
And once I did that

443
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
The company asked

444
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
We know there are other shops that are looking for that you want to do this

445
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
And by 88-89

446
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
I was helping other shops put in

447
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
POS systems

448
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
And by 90 I had launched a company that was to

449
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
So basically this company was

450
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Providing

451
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Installation service

452
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
You weren't actually making a soft

453
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
But you were doing what

454
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
2 years earlier somebody City

455
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,087
Do you hate you will wire your system up or twelve thousand bucks but you stop

456
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
I can do that for other people

457
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,231
That's right so so go from essentially like a ledger book with arrow

458
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
I like writing in

459
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Their sales

460
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
And they're counting by hand to a

461
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
Computer system entering numbers into a computer that was then

462
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
File them away or

463
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Create spreadsheets

464
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Yasso

465
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
What it was

466
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Paperless type of a

467
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
A format where what we were trying to do at that time with everything was done in triplicate with

468
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
Carbon paper or those that I

469
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
Duplicate where you would take an order then give you the yellow sheet and then the pink one would go to accounting and the white one will go to the design

470
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,951
Liner to make it in the driveway so this company called Daisy sister

471
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Comes out of Memphis

472
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Created the software and it was

473
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
They want flower shops as well

474
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
So I totally automated the flower shop

475
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
It's amazing cuz I mean obviously we take that for granted

476
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
You call

477
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
IPhone x new color

478
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
Shawty already know you are simply by the number that appears phone number that appears on there

479
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
An earphone

480
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,247
Up until that point I mean this most businesses were not

481
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Using computer system

482
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Computer sales right

483
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
And especially not flower shop

484
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Smells like they were

485
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Either expensive

486
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
So we started to do a lot of work and

487
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Can I buy 90

488
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
91

489
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
I was doing a hundred

490
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Percent of my working too

491
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Automating flowers

492
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
You are

493
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
Barely out of high school I mean still got the

494
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
The flower shops in Mountain also this new business

495
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
You know we we reply

496
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
I thought you know I had more work than we could ever

497
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Odoo we couldn't hire

498
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
People because

499
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
When I would tell them

500
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Want to say I have this

501
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Company and we automate

502
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,975
Flower shops like flower shops Okinawan you can hire somebody from IBM to come help you.

503
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
Mayflower she didn't think the industry was that big

504
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
Enormous thousands of flower shops

505
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
They all wanted

506
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
To get that efficiency your

507
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Or manage their customers

508
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
So we were doing stuff

509
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
And then there was a lot of money in it because there was hardly anybody do

510
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,455
Doing it and we we couldn't do them fast enough or or process the orders fast enough

511
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
Suits you are traveling that you play on the road every single day of the week

512
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,415
I was probably home three days of the month and the rest of the days I was on the road

513
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
What kind of what

514
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
What are you guys doing

515
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
Oh there was a year that I did over $1000000

516
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Wow

517
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
In in the network or flower shop in the number in the computer

518
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
So what happened to that company

519
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Also the the

520
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
Parent company sold so in 1997

521
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
Teleflora body thesis

522
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Customs and they ask

523
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Would you like

524
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
To work for

525
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
You sold your networking

526
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Prettiest part of this x-ray so Teleflora which

527
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Which is now of course

528
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Huge it was huge company

529
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:48,095
They bought this company and they said to you hey we we hear you do great work when you come work for us you said okay great

530
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
By then

531
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
You know I had to

532
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
4 year old and I was traveling a lot and I was ready to

533
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
Not travel as much as I thought I would really enjoy the part of working

534
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
For someone and not have to work

535
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
For myself and

536
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
And how to work as hard as I did and traveling

537
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
As much as I did

538
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
Also I thought I was ready

539
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
And how long would you last

540
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Physically month-and-a-half mentally about

541
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
What you work for them for a month-and-a-half

542
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Bump It Up 2 months at the mall

543
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
That's interesting I mean you must have really disliked it

544
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
I know it's not that I disliked it

545
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
I just think I missed that

546
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Hard

547
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
Of the craziness that I thought I'd wouldn't like

548
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
The craziness of owning a small business and kind of going day-to-day and wondering what's going to happen if I am I going to be able to do this

549
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
I realize that I like

550
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
And I enjoyed

551
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
That that I wanted to go back

552
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,159
So what do I do if I go and start a flower shop from scratch another one

553
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
In and bought a building and end started building a flower shop in

554
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
97 and within a few months I was back running the shops

555
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Is is that basically what you

556
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
You thought that you be doing for in Alex

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
For the foreseeable future

558
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
But then edible

559
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Got in the way

560
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,383
Edible Arrangements

561
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
I had seen the fruit business being.

562
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
I had interacted with a where

563
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,087
People who are doing good

564
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Fruit arrangements

565
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Exactly what this existed

566
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Yes

567
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Aligned then there was a

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Show on

569
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Cruise ship that would make me

570
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Big master

571
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
4 pieces of fruit

572
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
So I saw that and and

573
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
With it I started to Dabble

574
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
Into the electric how do you

575
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Make the

576
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Model scalable

577
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,104
How do you make a Ritz not a hobby or a small operation

578
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
That day I saw the opportunity in it

579
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
Kind of scaling you didn't do you know where you can open a few shops

580
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
And it really give a unique experience to the customers

581
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
And

582
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
What did you do did you start to

583
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
Experiment with

584
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
This idea at your flower shop

585
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
So yes yes

586
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Got some tools

587
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Got a knife and started to make

588
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Just like Stamped Out you know

589
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
Flowers from cantaloupes

590
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
Melon balls and they like that

591
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
The same way as we did the flowers in the bag

592
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Can you just

593
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
You just experiment you keep trying and

594
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Until you get it right

595
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
So I spent most of 98

596
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Doing that

597
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Esoteric

598
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
For people who have

599
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Kuzu no idea what Edible Arrangements are

600
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
Describe what it

601
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
What it what it is what it looks like

602
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
So it really evolved either so it started out with

603
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Fruit arrange

604
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
That look like a flower arrangement

605
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
From A Distant but it was all cut

606
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Fruit that yuan

607
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Literally remove the wrap

608
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Eat ever

609
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Gcse bitesize

610
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Strawberries cantaloupe

611
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Honeydew

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
A pineapple flowers with a

613
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Cantaloupe Center

614
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
So it is a flower arrangement

615
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
That you know the objective is to

616
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Wow and then

617
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Object is that it

618
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Pierce it disappears really

619
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
So after you started making

620
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,904
Examples of these arrangements are you testing them out with anyone

621
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
Yes

622
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Towards end of 97 and

623
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Beginning of 98

624
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
I started to send it off

625
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
Two friends end

626
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Samsung

627
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Be great but majority of them thought it wouldn't work

628
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Who's going to buy

629
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Food on sticks in

630
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
In a basket

631
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
Yeah I mean I could completely see if I was your friend at the time I was at the same thing I was

632
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
Who is going to buy

633
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Fruit arranged

634
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Flowers

635
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
What a weird idea

636
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
Why would you end up think this is going to be successful

637
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
My father was so I think

638
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Worried that he bought one of his friends

639
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
To who was a professor at a university

640
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
And my father saying I my son is starting this and

641
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Hey I bought in Solon Solon

642
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376

Any looks at Migos

645
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Why do you think

646
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
You know and I'm like

647
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
I see the reactions

648
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080

The brilliance

652
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712

You know and then I I know he asked me about a focus group I actually

662
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
I didn't know what if

663
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
Focus group was what he asked

664
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Can you do a focus

665
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,520
And I kind of said something to him that I think he didn't like I said I did to a focus group I took it home

666
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
I put it on the dining room table my mother looked at inside oh my God honey this is going to be

667
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760

East Haven Connecticut

698
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
It has a very simple layout there's a hand

699
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
I carved logo on a sign

700
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Counter

701
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
And a small cooler in the back of the fruit

702
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Because that first store opened right before Easter from the beginning business was

703
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Pretty good

704
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
And I sent out brochures I made these brochures

705
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,424
And the phone started to ring and where people were more

706
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,264
Curious they would call to hit I saw this is this really what I say

707
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Where is your shop

708
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
And then we tell them and so then people

709
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,224
I think we got 28 orders on Easter and I remember the numbers 28

710
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
NPR the biggest questions on the concern discussed

711
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Merced was that hate you know

712
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Animal doesn't really taste

713
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
How do I know it's going to be good

714
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
And that's where my mission

715
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
Came from and I remember getting on the phone with a customer and saying I guarantee you

716
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
The person who

717
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Gets it

718
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Will call you and use the word wow

719
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
If they don't use the word while

720
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
Will you call me back I will actually give you

721
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
100%

722
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,408
And really I said yes I never had to give anybody the

723
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Money back because

724
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
People loved it

725
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
A tentative time

726
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
Where where are you getting all this fruit from

727
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
We would go to the market in the morning and by the

728
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,464
How did you how could you guarantee that it was going to taste good because even

729
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,840
Cantaloupes are always good and melons are always good since sometimes they're just have that sweet pineapple

730
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Right I mean

731
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
How are you able to make sure that

732
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
The fruit was good

733
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
There's always good fruit

734
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
You just have to

735
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
One pay more

736
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544

00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
You're putting it soar like

740
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
The Shoppes you know you have to stamp

741
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Glad you have to learn about the

742
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
So now we have a whole team that does

743
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Since we all team

744
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
The fresh team that does

745
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
No that goes all the way to the

746
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Forms and sources

747
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
The fruit back then

748
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
Either you went and you shopped right

749
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Even when the food cost me a lot of money and I was losing money I wanted to

750
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
The customers to get that occur

751
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Experience because I was building a PC

752
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Business I was trying to build a brand

753
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
So with that we made sure

754
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
That the experience of the

755
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
The customer

756
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Was nothing short of a

757
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
And and you did that by making sure and then you threw away a lot of fruit

758
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,504
Because in when you buy a case there would be some pieces in it at you

759
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
And use you buy strawberries third of the Box you couldn't use

760
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,904
Because either that their shape wasn't right or they looked a little party

761
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
Or he knows. You pick the best one

762
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Wanting you

763
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Make it better but you know eventually as we

764
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
We grew we were able to Source it properly

765
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Leanne get it right

766
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,656
The farm of knowing exactly the variety we want

767
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Yeah

768
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
How long does it take before

769
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
It actually

770
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
You you you felt comfortable that it was going to take off

771
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
About a year

772
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Maria

773
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,784
Did you have a vision at that point that this was going to be a national or International brand or did you think

774
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
I maybe this working will you know

775
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
I'll make more money and then I'll take that money and buy it

776
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
You know build another Outlet

777
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Another shop

778
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
So I never thought it would be

779
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
National and that National Journey started

780
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,168
In 2000 where gentleman walked into our shop

781
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,984
And that look I was just visiting my mom from Boston

782
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
And everybody loved this arrangement

783
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Can I open one of these in Boston

784
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,736
And anyways can I buy a franchise now of course I knew about franchising but I hadn't thought about franchising

785
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
Edible Arrangements

786
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Thought about building a

787
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Brad

788
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
That's why I spend so much time on the logo in

789
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
The name

790
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
So and I compose myself

791
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
Is that all that sounds wonderful

792
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
But we thought about

793
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Where would you like to open

794
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,376
Migos Boston I said wonderful let me talk to my attorney I didn't have one

795
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
And I will get right back to you

796
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,984
And so I called my attorney who was a real estate at

797
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,056
Attorney and the egg called him up I said looking I need a franchise.

798
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
I know nothing about that

799
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
You know so he looked it up because they had this is Campo

800
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
We started that journey of then

801
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
I'm getting the documents ready

802
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
And doing everything tour

803
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
First franchise

804
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
And

805
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,904
One year later we opened our first store

806
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
In Waltham Mass

807
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
So after that first franchise

808
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
How did you attract

809
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
More franchisee statue

810
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
To cut connect with a

811
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Like a

812
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
A law firm or company that does this and then they

813
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Put it out there to the world

814
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
I never know we didn't want it at

815
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,592
What time so it was all word-of-mouth so up to our first

816
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
10 or 15 shops

817
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
It was all word of mouth because I was more

818
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Concerned with

819
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Doing it right

820
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
What happened with us was that then somebody

821
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Visiting Boston

822
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
Calls from Atlanta and I live in Atlanta I want open one.

823
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,328
Please in Atlanta then I think the fifth call was from somebody in Northridge California say hey

824
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
I just saw this

825
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,704
I like to open a 1 in in in California

826
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
How do you say

827
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:41,920
How are you able to maintain quality like how how are you able to make sure that

828
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,040
A franchise owner wouldn't try to cut Corners by buying a cheaper fruit or

829
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Cutting them smaller cutting

830
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Pizza small

831
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,976
How are you able to maintain the quality that you want the youth kind of slade out in your

832
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Store

833
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Buffer state

834
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
It's the owner

835
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
So with that is first choosing the right

836
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
The right person

837
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,448
After that just having an amazing

838
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Training system

839
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
Are you just going to train on how to make the rain

840
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,104
How to do the customer service we were the ones going

841
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Each one of these shops

842
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Literally replicating

843
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Everything

844
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
So where you guys just

845
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Kind of growing light

846
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
1 * 2 time

847
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,112
What what happened in 2004

848
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
The business started

849
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Takeoff we started

850
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,232
Get a lot of phone calls I was able to hire someone that can start

851
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Putting together structure and start selling

852
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
And

853
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Inn at the appointed

854
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Pretty much got automated and got bigger than me

855
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
How to stop iHeart a team

856
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
And that's when the magic

857
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
And the one I hired that team and all these things that we had automated and put into system we were by mm

858
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Four 2005 wrestling 300 stores a year

859
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
And were you mean

860
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
At this point

861
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
I mean I think one might imagine that you had

862
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,744
Tons and tons of cash coming into the business or was it more complicated

863
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
It was a lot more complicated because

864
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
As soon as

865
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
We got to a certain size we open to Warehouse

866
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Start doing the supply chain

867
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,312
I expanded the computer the computer business and started hiring a lot of the developers now the website was being devolved

868
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
Let you know the next generation of software was being developed

869
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,688
Lot of the money was going into building the infrastructure

870
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
Because I was more interested in scaling it

871
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,600
So there was never really much money and I and I remember. I would

872
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Invite people to my home

873
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
And I drove around

874
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
A 1990

875
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Before

876
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,304
In a Volvo 850 and people would come by single volume

877
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
I know you have hundreds

878
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
The story

879
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,656
And it would look me like we know it doesn't look like he's that's accessible

880
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,752
Hey how we cuz I lived in a little raised ranch and for me that wasn't important

881
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,312
I knew that I can always do that later in life

882
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
Yeah but building the brand is very

883
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,456
Cancel all my money at all my energy everything was invested back into

884
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
To the company and it paid off

885
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
So even after you already had like

886
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
200 stores

887
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:02,208
You were still reinvesting because right because it's really scale

888
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,536
I mean it in in many of the examples that we had on the show

889
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
It seems like at a certain point entrepreneurs

890
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
Have to turn to outside

891
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,728
Investors they have to bring an outside investor to really really

892
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
GrubEx

893
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
And is that what happened with you guys

894
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,408
So we didn't bring out any investors even though by 2006

895
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
2007 many people are interested in buying into

896
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
The brand

897
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
Or investing in the brand and I had many offer

898
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Private equities wanting to

899
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
To get involved

900
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
I just

901
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,744
Didn't see any benefit of it at that time since I was self-funding and doing it

902
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Why dilute

903
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
When you were working like

904
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
Dog the whole time

905
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
I think dogs even get a break sometime

906
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Casinos Ohio

907
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
Obviously turkey work

908
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
And you did

909
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Incredibly well and will

910
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
Talk more about that

911
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,200
In a minute but I mean

912
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Is that

913
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Is that sort of the trade-off

914
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,344
You know that they have a professional success at that level you

915
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
Can I have to give up some family time I mean

916
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
I read that your first marriage ended

917
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
In divorce

918
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,560
And then you had three girls at

919
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,168
Universal you weren't able to spend much time with so there was a price to be paid for

920
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
A very heavy very heavy price yes

921
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
There's a

922
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
And it's something that people

923
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
You know you have to be ready for an our business is very you

924
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
Show me when people are taking time off we're working

925
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,648
So on the holidays is when we're busy so when at people are going into the

926
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Is holidays

927
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
We're just going

928
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
Started and so we're going to be busy through that

929
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
You know what I think the

930
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,608
The biggest thing that you look back at and

931
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
You wish you did it differently

932
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,496
This is probably the children you know the you know the

933
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
The kids because

934
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
I don't think they understand

935
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,920
I don't care if you're rich or poor you know they just want their time and they want

936
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Your Lovin

937
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,504
A lot of times you're spending all this energy where you

938
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Think you'll be big

939
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
But they're not seeing it

940
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
You're not taking Mom to fancy vacations you're not

941
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:11,232
You know you're working night and day you have no money you can't get a bank loan

942
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
So if you're telling a business to be big one day

943
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
And you know the nice thing is that they continue supporting you and they stay behind you and that's critical to someone who wants a scale app

944
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,496
Business and working a business and build a brand

945
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
This is you read about every Wednesday

946
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Steve Jobs movie

947
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
To tell you how much

948
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,616
Albert the price they paid

949
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
For that success

950
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
It is very

951
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Australia time

952
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,504
You don't know what my oldest is

953
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Working with me and I I tell you

954
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Every

955
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
Because I see her and end

956
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
And God willing

957
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
Hand it off to her how old is something that she could be

958
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,024
She's 23 and she works for the company

959
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
Dasha Belize

960
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
I'm glad my daughter is

961
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
But smarter than me

962
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
So okay see you

963
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
You're building this company

964
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Growing really

965
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Play fast

966
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,128
And then I guess at a certain point you did

967
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
Actually take some private Equity money right in invite 2012

968
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
2012

969
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,040
And what why why did you decide to to

970
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
Except that money when you guys

971
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
We're doing great without it

972
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
Did I come from simple back

973
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,536
And you know I I didn't know anything about business I've never had any tray

974
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
My family's never

975
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,680
So you're always in doubt

976
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
That are you the

977
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
The person

978
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Who can run it

979
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Cooking scale at

980
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Do you know what

981
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
Are you doing I remember

982
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
My attorney asking me

983
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
That he should be listed as a CEO and I'm like

984
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Why don't I see you

985
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
And I remember reading books about wuxi

986
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
Videos are in interviewing people for

987
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Tes position so there's always this doubt

988
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
You know you work

989
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Very hard to build this

990
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
Company you wanted to grow

991
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
You don't want to make

992
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Make a mistake

993
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,632
And so that was a thing was it was more for what I didn't know

994
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,240
I'm really curious about you started this company

995
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Your company is

996
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Door Brands your idea

997
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,896
You franchise it all these people are running it it's really great

998
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,992
You know but then in 2010 a bunch of franchisees

999
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
Did they file a lawsuit against you

1000
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
I guess there was a dispute about

1001
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,392
How long did the store should be open and

1002
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
Things like that and that that lasted

1003
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
I pray that lasted for like 3 years

1004
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Was that

1005
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Was that tough did I take a toll

1006
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Emotionally

1007
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
Yes you know I I I put my heart in

1008
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
King and I just was

1009
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
So you know I know you're heartbroken

1010
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
You can't believe it happened

1011
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,128
You know I remember I have a very good friend of mine who

1012
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Susan light attorney who's going to the right-hand person

1013
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
Guided me and I remember him saying something

1014
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
When I Got Served

1015
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
With the lawsuit

1016
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Say well you know

1017
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
This just a matter of

1018
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
I'm surprised

1019
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,720
Lawsuit is part of the culture and this will happen

1020
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Pick a franchise is like a fan

1021
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Even in families are

1022
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Just disagree yeah

1023
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,400
And end when your leader even if the leader of a family sometimes you ask

1024
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
The family to do something and everybody and it sometimes everybody

1025
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
To say we disagree

1026
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,360
And we were kind of running the business from our point of view instead of the customers party

1027
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
Give you flowers and Convenience Center

1028
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
And and Lena deliveries and all that stuff in the world was changing

1029
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
So we made some decisions at that point that we need

1030
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
And we had some that disagreed

1031
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
And at that point.

1032
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Legal action

1033
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
What did the outcome

1034
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
It was nice at the end

1035
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
All the initiatives that we talked about

1036
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Did work end

1037
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Another lawsuit

1038
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Was withdrawn

1039
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,936
And you know I think the relationship anybody that's

1040
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Thinking about getting into

1041
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Franchise should realize

1042
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,360
That it is a relationship that you are actually now getting into a partnership with another

1043
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Entrepreneur

1044
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
You don't have to spend a lot of time listening and making sure and inspiring and understanding what you're doing and you may disagree.

1045
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Times but you better have you act

1046
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Together and you better have you

1047
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Deposit together because

1048
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
I'll let you feel once or twice but they won't let

1049
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,000
That you feel too many times in her goofy things

1050
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,096
Because it's their livelihood you're playing with if you're just simply

1051
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Putting initiatives together

1052
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
That are really thought

1053
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Thrill

1054
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,008
Do you is it important for you to be right

1055
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,800
Are you prepared to be wrong

1056
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
Oh I'm very pretty

1057
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
What I learned

1058
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Long time ago

1059
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
What was that

1060
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
When you're wrong

1061
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
And you admit that you

1062
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
You're wrong everybody around you

1063
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
You will help you

1064
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Tutu color

1065
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Dig out of it

1066
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
And to help you learn a lesson

1067
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
But if you have an ego

1068
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
Or you think you are right

1069
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
People

1070
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
At that point not only will but have the

1071
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
The right to stop

1072
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
And I'm not I haven't gotten to where I've gone to

1073
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Because I've been right

1074
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
It's just I've asked the right

1075
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
People and bounce ideas off

1076
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
People I love calling

1077
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
People up out of the blue and

1078
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
Just saying hey

1079
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Thinking about this what do you think

1080
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
So I'll go

1081
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
I'll be on a

1082
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,808
In Bahamas with the family and we're on a phishing

1083
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
You know somebody is not really doing it right

1084
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
We got couple of boats

1085
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
Did it this way set up this customers set up a website it sucks.

1086
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Just enjoy the

1087
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,608
You just you kind of see opportunity in everything and

1088
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
And and you think you can

1089
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
Can do it because I think we as a business owner you

1090
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Your job is to build businesses

1091
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
Edible Arrangement stores are there in the US Senate

1092
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456

00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,200
I don't underestimate the power of a kind of the market that

1104
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,600
We have here in it and it's amazing and I realize you were saying that I have to pinch myself because I I am still I remember

1105
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
You know my mother said something amazing

1106
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:06,560
When I was 17 18 that really changed me for the rest of my life. You know I used to struggle I would come home

1107
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Okay what doing this much

1108
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
I will not

1109
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Enough money I got to do this

1110
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Expensive

1111
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,312
And does she she just in Oceano to she said it in your she turned around and she goes out honey

1112
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Are you have to stop chasing money be

1113
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Because money runs

1114
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Is really fast

1115
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
You should go do the right thing it will chase you

1116
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,808
And the NFL point I stopped worrying about me

1117
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,880
Money so when the bank said no I didn't go there and say oh my God this

1118
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Homework I went and fee

1119
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928

1120
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
How to make it work

1121
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
Your dad came to this country

1130
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Enjoys

1131

Oyster travel a lot do a lot of those things

1132
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Things that you want to do

1133
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
And did you want to be able to

1134
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
For your father

1135
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
My mom

1136
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
You know never really got to see how it was 2005

1137
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
Has she passed away and she was sick for a while

1138
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
And she was instrumental

1139
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Avicii

1140
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,631
Literally you know what she was that person that when I wanted to stop at

1141
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
And give up and

1142
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Couldn't make

1143
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
The bills

1144
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
She would always kind of

1145
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
You know remind me that you'll make it in

1146
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
As long as you have your health

1147
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
You'll do it keep going

1148
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
So that that's what I missed

1149
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,687
What's that I wish she got to see this

1150
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
She spent a lot of time wanting her children

1151
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,575
To be very successful wanting to me to be very successful

1152
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
And pushing me

1153
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
I think

1154
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
She should be

1155
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Top of the world

1156
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,743
Right now she was around to see what we were able to

1157
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,607
What to do in starting out with this little flower shop that I used to drop her off in the morning and go to high school

1158
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
Then she would watch the shop

1159
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
And I

1160
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
I know so. That's the part that

1161
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
That's

1162
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,775
And I wish it was a little bit

1163
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Want to see it but

1164
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,359
My father is an otter

1165
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Every single

1166
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895

He grew up in West Haven

1175
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:22,239
By the way Terex original Mentor Charlie circelli you know the guy who taught him and his brother had to run a flower

1176
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Up when they were kids

1177
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Well we call them to find out what

1178
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
He thought

1179
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
About his mental

1180
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127

1181
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663

00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
How do you like this kids

1183
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,015
I pick my brain in the open up

1184
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,903
I'm in competition with them but you know it was a beautiful copper

1185
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
I'm happy with that kind of competition

1186
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,863
After 38 years in business Charlie Ferris Ellie sold his flower shop this past

1187
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631

Splash Park

1209
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
Hey thanks for sticking around because

1210
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
Time now for how you built that my name is Brooklyn Gold Bradbury I'm based in Tacoma Wash

1211
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Washington and I am a co-founder of a company called 512 apparel

1212
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:07,199
What acquire something Brooklyn knows a lot about because it since she was a kid

1213
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
Pretty serious volleyball player so years and years of volleyball wearing different uniforms different

1214
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Brands you really start to pay attention to what kind of materials you like and what bothers you about a uniform and what's up

1215
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:26,399
Uncomfortable uniforms

1216
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,799
You really uncomfortable in many many ways they have itchy seems or if they're too tight in certain spots are they

1217
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
I won't stay down another spot since

1218
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Some of them

1219
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
They're way too fake and they don't breathe and so you just their way too sweaty and gross and you just can't wait to get them off

1220
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:47,903
Luckily for Brooklyn her stepdad Jeff is a designer in the clothing industry and a two of them

1221
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,303
Start the talked about maybe going into business together to make a new line of athletic wear

1222
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,887
Alvin apparel company it's very difficult to get started because

1223
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Consumers have the brands that they like and it's hard to pull somebody away from a brand that they know and love but Jeff

1224
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,943
I've started to think of an idea that could set their company apart especially in a place like Seattle

1225
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
If you'd heard of a textile mill in Taiwan that used coffee grounds to make fabric

1226
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,743
Apparently it's great fabric for athletes with a very very breathable fabric but it's also

1227
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Odor Control so as you sweat and say you work out and then you go do something afterwards you're not worried about your clothes smelling

1228
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,543
Godly like maybe some other spandex material would or like a cotton t-shirt would and in case you were wondering the closed

1229
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Not make you smell like coffee

1230
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,687
Brooklyn decided to work with that Mill in Taiwan

1231
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
And most of their coffee

1232
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
Comes from the local Starbucks

1233
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
The mill picks up the grounds and they extract all of the oil so that what's left is the coffee ground

1234
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
Boil and then a very fine powder and that powder is infused in the yarn and that's what gives it its properties so

1235
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:06,239
The coffee grounds are Blended in with the yarn that we use

1236
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,847
They started to work on a bunch of prototypes and I started with long-sleeve jerseys

1237
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,919
They handed them out to volleyball players and other athletes

1238
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
Ask a lot of questions how does it feel around the shoulders and how does it feel when your unit bending up and down as if a

1239
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:26,719
Fabric moving or staying in place and yeah that was a huge part of it before we actually launched an order our food

1240
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:33,119
Full line and now that full line is out and available on the company's website they've been selling for about a year

1241
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:39,519
Around $200,000 and are refurbishing a lot of coffee grounds right now

1242
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Welfare last collection we use close to 2,000 lb of reuse coffee grounds which equates to about

1243
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,759
45000 cups of coffee or 90000 shots of espresso

1244
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,343
And we love that idea we love it it's eco-friendly

1245
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,159
There were using something that we all drink daily

1246
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
