A drag-and-drop email Builder

00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
And customer support

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
7 days away

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Campaign monitor.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,600
Over one month.

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
52 people got sick with ecoli will you freaking out well

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
We got no freaking out has the right the right way to describe it all in

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,984
It was like it was really intense

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,568
You don't know you wouldn't wish this on anybody

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
You know that anyone would get sick from the food that you serve them is really a tough thing

16
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Ramen.

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
It's how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind them

18
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
I'm guy Raz

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
Has Steve Ells turned his love for San Francisco's mission style burritos in to Chipotle a restaurant

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,920
Rocket launched America's fast casual food craze

21
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,208
Ted Talk by a guy named Barry Schwartz paradox

22
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Choice

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,376
Barry explains it virtually all current research on human behavior supports this idea

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Human

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
We don't really like to have too many choices

26
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Is anything beyond 4 to 6

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Actually makes us anxious and unhappy

28
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,664
Which could help explain the success of Chipotle

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Because if you've ever been in one

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
You can probably tell me the menu by heart

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Burrito bowl

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Salad

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Tacos for options that is it

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
There isn't a whole lot to agonize over

35
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
And it's one of the reasons why Chipotle

36
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Exploded in mm

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
On the eve of the millennium

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
Company headshots today

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,544
Chipotle has nearly 2300 locations across the US

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
For other countries

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
It's value is around 14

42
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Billion dollars no Chipotle as you will hear was never meant to become what it became it was supposed

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
Be a one-off burrito joint in Denver

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,440
A burrito joint that would generate enough cash to finance a high-end restaurant

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
That was details his plan he's actually a classically trained chef

46
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
He wanted to make Michelin star food not

47
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
Foil wrapped burritos

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
The earliest recollection I have

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Being in the kitchen and in cooking

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
In the third grade and we lived in Germany

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
And I remember cooking

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Scrambled eggs

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
How do you make them to just grab them before.

54
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,648
Do cracked eggs into the pan of scrambling or did you scrambling before no no I scrambled them

55
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
04

56
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
With a fork

57
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
And then I my mom had a

58
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
A very well seasoned

59
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
A cast iron skillet

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
I mean it was very very

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Smooth

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
And I almost

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Non-stick

64
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
And I used to push

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
The Kurds

66
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Into the center

67
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
In a square shape a perfect square maybe three

68
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
3 or 3 and 1/2 by 3 and 1/2 cents

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
My God

70
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
And then and then it was when it was just set enough I would flip it over

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,440
And dumb I mean it was very controlling my can says a lot about me cuz I'm

72
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
I'm a little bit of a

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
Of course I had no idea then but

74
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
It's an interesting it's an interesting memory

75
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
Okay what point did you start to

76
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
I've read like stories but you in college where you

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
You dare parties in Tempe

78
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
What is this butter that you better eat

79
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,920
Duck confit and stuff like why did you even

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
NOAA

81
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
How did you get into Foods at such a young age

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
Yeah well you know my mom was a very

83
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Adventurous cook and a really good one

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
And she had a garden and

85
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,488
She got all the cooking magazines that have a lot of cookbooks and and I used to

86
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,071
I used to spend time in the kitchen and an in follow along

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
At some point I started watching

88
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Cooking shows

89
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Julia Child

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Graham on the Galloping Gourmet

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
PBS series The MasterChef series

92
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
I really love those and and would duplicate

93
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
The recipes

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
And then like to cook for

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
You know my family and then

96
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,087
When I was older in high school I started having people over

97
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
2

98
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
You go to college

99
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
In in Boulder right

100
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,535
Yes and you stay art history

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Of course it made

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
Zero sense to my father

103
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
What do you do with a art history

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,567
So what do you do at our history degree of course you know I don't know

105
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
We'll see we'll see how this unfolds and improbably I was thinking that I would continue and Go to graduate school

106
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
But my roommate

107
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Suggested to me that I go to cooking school she said this just weeks before

108
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Graduation why did she suggest that you knew I was into cooking and I think she had visited the culinary

109
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Institute of America

110
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
And 50 of what you would love this place

111
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
So I applied and I went and and only went because if I knew exactly what I wanted

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
It was an adventure but I would say

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
There is a there's a halfway point

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Where you go for a

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
A few months and work in a restaurant

116
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
Of your choice and I chose to work at Stars restaurant in San Francisco most famous

117
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Best restaurant like one of them in America

118
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Jeremiah Tower right it was the was the Hedgehog

119
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,375
It was a really important restaurant and I had eaten at stars

120
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Few times when I was in college

121
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
And loved him in like Mario Batali

122
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
Formal tons of really famous chess

123
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,015
Anthony Bourdain like Presa documentary about him what was he like to work for

124
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,903
It is hard to describe I really what what he's like I will say that

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,791
An amazing Visionary and quite a perfectionist and so it was high pressure

126
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
Sure and it was super super stressful

127
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
Really really hard work

128
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
But you would

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
Put your dishes up in and all the cooks will put their dishes out and injure my would come along and taste and you know it was

130
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
What's up you can range from you know an odd liking a good job to picking up the plate and throw it in the trash which was

131
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Really traumatic but I loved it I really did and I'm lucky to have

132
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
I've been able to work there when you were first in San Francisco.

133
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Did you

134
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Did you encounter

135
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423
Burritos are food that you would eventually

136
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Change your life

137
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Sure

138
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
The idea for

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Chipotle

140
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Is a

141
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Combination of

142
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Food

143
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Borrowed from Stars

144
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
And

145
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
Technique

146
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
And a service

147
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Format

148
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Borrowed from the taquerias

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,439
In the in San Francisco in San Francisco Mission District special about those

150
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Taquerias

151
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Through a few of them in anyway

152
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Quite good

153
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,887
And I used to I used to go to these places before work

154
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
The first time I went

155
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
A friend of mine took me

156
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
And I got the

157
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Are we.

158
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,359
Probably a Carnitas burrito giant flour tortilla

159
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
All the things on the

160
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
On the inside

161
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
The rice to beans meat salsa

162
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Jesus excetera

163
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
And then wrapped up in a rap

164
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
I take it

165
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
To the counter and I and I unwrapped it

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
And he's like what you doing

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Unwrapping my burrito

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Take the foil off the foil pack and

169
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
Rewrap and try this again

170
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
I love that I just I was intrigued

171
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
The growing up in

172
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
In Colorado

173
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
This is not how we ate burritos burritos were

174
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
On a plate and then smothered

175
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Green chili

176
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
So that really

177
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Interesting experience for me in and I went a lot

178
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
I just started

179
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Counting the number of people going to the line

180
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
Tamagotchis are five bucks a piece.

181
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
I just quick math

182
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
The couple guys cooking

183
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Disturbing

184
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
But you know on the napkin I was like

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
Oh okay this is a pretty good economic model of course I wasn't called calling it an economic model then I was

186
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
I said I could probably make some money with this and in with that money

187
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
I could afford to open up my

188
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
A full-scale restaurant

189
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Just understand you

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
You Saturday 8

191
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
Taqueria could earn you enough money that you could open up a fine dining

192
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Well I I mean that that seems logical to me that I mean that seemed like the way to do it now and you know these

193
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:13,727
These these burrito shops these taquerias were small the investment would be low

194
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
The red circle

195
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
It was low

196
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
And and there were lines out the door

197
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
And I thought that

198
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
That I could make enough money

199
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
To fund my full-scale restaurant

200
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
And

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
So I knew I wanted to move back

202
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Colorado

203
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Start this

204
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Why

205
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
But there's nothing like it in Colorado

206
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
I certainly didn't want to compete with all the taquerias in the mission was not

207
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
It wouldn't be novelty

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah maybe it would be

209
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Really good

210
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
Maybe I could make better burritos but again I thought

211
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
I wanted to go to a place where no one

212
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,055
I've seen the style of service before by the way how did you figure out how to do the rest

213
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Obviously you're a chef but

214
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
You know there's techniques in his ways of of really making

215
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Refried beans

216
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Are pinto beans or whatever it was

217
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Carnitas how did you come up with

218
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Short well

219
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
Stars was really good training

220
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
We would we would come in at

221
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
At noon

222
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
And

223
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
You know we would learn

224
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
At that time what we were going to cook that evening

225
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
And you know there wasn't a set menu

226
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Per se and there weren't recipes for sale

227
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
You had to

228
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Figure it out based on

229
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
Style of the restaurant in and what you know Jeremiah and Mark

230
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
The executive chef wanted

231
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
And so

232
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Wasn't like I had to

233
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
You know labor over the

234
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
The recipes it was it's it's relatively simple food

235
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Or I should say it

236
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
It's really simple food Chipotle

237
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
So you wanted it you want to go to

238
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Quebec to Colorado

239
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
End

240
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
Maybe opening up in Boulder Colorado

241
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah I thought I would open it up in Boulder

242
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
And had trouble finding a location

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
But I liked

244
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
But I could afford

245
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Nothing seemed right

246
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
And a friend of mine was working

247
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
In Denver

248
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Somehow

249
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Commercial real estate broker

250
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Went to his office and made a pitch

251
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
And just sit here here's what I'm thinking of doing and I described

252
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Chipotle

253
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Pretty much as you see it today

254
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
Description to what was it going to be

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Well

256
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
You know I described

257
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
The food I describe the service format

258
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
I said

259
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
First of all you know it's going to be an open kitchen

260
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
And we're going to be grilling Meats

261
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
And cooking whole beans

262
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
And mashing avocados for guacamole

263
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
And grating the cheese

264
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Dicing tomatoes

265
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Pano's

266
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Onions

267
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Chopping fresh herbs like cilantro and oregano and

268
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,255
And you know he's deeply stupid seems very excited about the

269
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
The prospect

270
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
And so on

271
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,143
He said he'll give me give me a about a week

272
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Identify you know a few

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Potential real estate sites and will go on a tour

274
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
And the

275
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,663
We saw a Dolly Madison ice cream store was the first sight we saw

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
I near

277
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
University of Denver campus

278
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
850

279
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Square feet

280
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
It was in terrible condition

281
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
It needed a lot of work

282
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
I think the rent

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
What's $800

284
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,023
Basically nothing and so

285
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Convince my father to

286
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Lend me the money was actually

287
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Buena Park

288
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
Investment art loan

289
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
What's 93

290
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
Can I forget how much I

291
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,895
Holdem initially but it ended up being $80,000

292
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
$85,000

293
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
So so it was a

294
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
Substantial but not insane

295
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Momentum I need u u Bass

296
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
I needed that money to

297
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
Clean up the place and make it look nice

298
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
Yeah I mean I had to

299
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Strip off the

300
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Vinyl

301
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Tiles on the floor and reveal the oak

302
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Wood floor underneath which I refinish

303
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Painted the walls and

304
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Kitchen

305
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Child it

306
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Stainless steel

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
On the walls

308
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,175
Well so I had an architect of record to get the to the permit

309
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,063
And found the contractor and then sort of designed and built as we go and I was there every day and I was

310
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Hands-On

311
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Build-A-Bear

312
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Do you have a

313
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Just natural design aesthetic is that Sly Caillou is your is just so you know something that you're next

314
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
Well I would say that the design aesthetic came out of the

315
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,799
Necessity to be frugal so that so the table bases were pipes

316
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
The service counter I was faced with barn metal just just materials that were inexpensive

317
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
And that were easy to to install and I remember making the table tops with the with contractor

318
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Or any and we were applying the stainless steel to the top of the plywood and

319
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
Anthony wanted to put stainless steel on the edges also and I said no no no you have to you have to let people see

320
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Plywood they have to see the striations the plywood have to see how it built and so the esthetic for Chipotle was

321
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,455
Was very much about how it was put together and I think this spoke to the food

322
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
So as you looked past the counter into the kitchen you could see the basic ingredients you could see

323
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
See no

324
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
Chicken and steak and avocados

325
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
Rice beans and all things and how it was simply put together and so I think this

326
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Connection to the built environment was something that made the brand special

327
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
I don't think it was obvious to most people I know think that man wasn't even obvious to me at the time so you so you open

328
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
The first

329
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Right

330
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
And it was it was going to be like

331
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Temporary thing

332
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
This was going to be one restaurant in this was going to be

333
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
A cash cow that could

334
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
I fund and help support

335
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
A full-scale restaurant

336
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
You know I knew I knew that full scale restaurants

337
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
But we were a dicey proposition I mean they go out of business

338
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Offender is

339
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Hard to make margins

340
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Very difficult to operate

341
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
And so I wanted

342
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Chipotle to be a backup

343
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
I deliberately made it very simple

344
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
To operate only a few items

345
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
And symbol

346
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Cooking techniques

347
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Not a lot of

348
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Ingredients

349
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
And

350
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
Able to operate with just

351
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
I'm just a handful of

352
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
OVO crew members

353
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
How did you come up with a name

354
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Chipotle cuz I remember

355
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
When I first

356
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Sorry Chipotle

357
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
I knew what a Chipotle pepper was but I was like

358
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
How is that

359
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Pronounce

360
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
Is it in this is like in the you know like the mid-90s

361
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Chipotle

362
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Eartha Kitt Poteau

363
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
I could not have been the first one so how did you come up with that name

364
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,855
So I knew always that I was going to use Chipotle peppers

365
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
In the marinade

366
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
You know for the Braves for the barbacoa

367
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
In the beans

368
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
And I and I want to use Chipotle because

369
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
It really adds

370
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
The depth

371
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
It's not about the Heat.

372
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Smokey

373
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Character

374
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
I think really

375
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
As complexity

376
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
Lni was introduced

377
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Chipotle peppers

378
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Stars

379
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
Jeremiah was a big fan of

380
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Southwest

381
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Cuisine

382
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
And it just occurred to me

383
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
As I was

384
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Looking at a can of

385
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Of Chipotle peppers

386
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
That's the name

387
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
I'll call Chipotle

388
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
And of course

389
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Nobody knew what it was

390
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
And every thought everyone wanted

391
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
I thought I was

392
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Silly

393
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,215
Choosing a name that people couldn't pronounce Chipotle

394
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
What

395
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,335
Oh yeah so imagine choosing a name that people can't pronounce and they don't know

396
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,175
What it means name

397
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
Chipotle was not an easy

398
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Place

399
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
I remember customers coming in

400
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
What is that place to poodles patil

401
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Jose

402
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
All kinds of all kinds of pronunciations

403
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Canal 5 hurt at all

404
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
And then you had to walk up to the counter and actually

405
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Build your

406
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Burrito in this was

407
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,335
This was confusing to a lot of people they said what do you have and I said well you have all these things.

408
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Burritos

409
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
In the burrito rice beans

410
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Beats

411
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Salsa's

412
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,111
I mean if you look beautiful now and it just seems so obvious how you

413
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
You would use Chipotle but in the early days

414
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
It was a very novel experience

415
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
Was also a novel experience to have an open kitchen so close to the customer I mean the grill was just a few feet away

416
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Away from customers and so they were really

417
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,007
They were really involved in the production

418
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
That was

419
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
You know the cooking in the

420
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Service

421
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
And it was it was by Design I mean

422
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
You know every time you have a dinner party

423
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
People are in the kitchen people want to be in the kitchen and so

424
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
So Chipotle

425
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,695
I was designed to to invite people in to bring them close to where the action is the shaft

426
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
And also

427
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Cashier and you had like

428
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Couple people helping you

429
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
It's Beginning

430
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
Wide open I opened with

431
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Really only a handful of people

432
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
And I asked

433
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Some of my

434
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Friends

435
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,847
If they wanted to help work the line and and

436
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
It was him. Really

437
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Cobbled together

438
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
And did you did you just

439
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Make

440
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Stafford is your IP address

441
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
I want none of this

442
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Down

443
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Guy that the menu was developed

444
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
The day before I opened

445
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,023
Yeah and it was interesting because when I trained the Kooks

446
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
How to make all the difference

447
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,399
You know ingredients it was it was how I learned it stars it was

448
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
It was about

449
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Technique

450
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
And then about tasting as you go

451
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
And

452
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Stitches didn't

453
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
Hurting me to write down recipes yeah

454
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
A because I wanted people

455
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Taste of food and really understand the techniques

456
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
Of cooking not just think about adding you know

457
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
A cup of this a tablespoon of that

458
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
And and be done with it

459
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Probably when we open eyes

460
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Can't imagine it was another fast food restaurant

461
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Where

462
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
The crew actually

463
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
TASTY food

464
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
I just I just don't think they

465
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
They did that

466
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Right yeah

467
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
UEC start this restaurant and like what

468
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Are people immediately

469
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
Is it a hit right away because

470
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Because you said a burrito in Colorado is this

471
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
Sting on a plate smothered green chili sauce owed it did

472
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
All of a sudden

473
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
Burrito San Francisco style burritos here in Denver

474
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,063
So I remember opening a July 13th

475
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
And open for dinner

476
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
It was mostly friends and I think the sales

477
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
The first day or proper

478
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
200

479
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
$40

480
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Like that

481
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
And the next day

482
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
A little bit more

483
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
And the next day

484
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
A little bit more

485
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
And we sort of we got faster and more efficient than

486
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
And word spread

487
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Pretty quickly

488
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
And

489
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
Students got got back to campus

490
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
September

491
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
And so that helped business a little bit

492
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
But the turning point

493
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
I was in awe

494
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
October

495
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Of 93

496
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
And

497
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
The restaurant reviewer for

498
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
The Rocky Mountain news

499
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Was named

500
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Bill st. John

501
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
And he came in a few times

502
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,423
And then introduced himself and said have been in a few times

503
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Writer

504
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Restaurant View

505
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
How's it how's the review going to be

506
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
I'm not going to tell you

507
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Okay

508
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
And

509
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
The next day

510
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
A review came out

511
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
And it was it was a really glowing review

512
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
And it was one particular

513
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
A sentence that that stood out

514
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
And in it and in a paraphrasing but it went something like this

515
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
Chipotle is unlike any fast food

516
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
You've had

517
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
Everything has depth

518
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Character

519
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Nuance

520
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
And layers of flavor

521
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
That I really struck me on my butt

522
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
This guy has got it because

523
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Because when I think about

524
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
Cooking and seasoning food I'm thinking about those things

525
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
And

526
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,159
What happened next though we were completely unprepared for what happened

527
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
A bit a line out the door

528
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Did not stop

529
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
And we ran out of food

530
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
The first day

531
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
And so we got

532
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:32,032
Bigger or the next day and ran out of food the second day and just

533
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Could not

534
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Keep up

535
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,224
And that started a chain of events that would forever change the way we think

536
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
A fast food

So it's October 1993 Chipotle has a single store in Denver that's been open

562
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,704
He was a great first review from a local paper

563
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,568
And people started showing up to buy burritos like a lot of people

564
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
It was crazy crazy busy and remember this is 850 sq ft total and so

565
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:53,344
A little less than half of that was the was the kitchen so you were presumably

566
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:58,720
Profitable in your first year I was profitable in the first few months

567
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,048
And I remember paying my dad back blown part

568
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
At

569
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
You know I was probably that year and still taking a salary for yourself

570
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
That point

571
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
I was living

572
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
In the basement of a friend's house couch in the basement I slept on the couch I was working from first thing in the morn

573
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,504
Morning until you know late at night

574
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
And doing that

575
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
Well everyday and I remember I paid my dad back and he said they'll Steve

576
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Wait a minute you can't be

577
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,376
I really I think it's doing very well and you know he knows he knew that I had

578
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
Taking any business classes in

579
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,800
I'd never demonstrated an ability to balance my checkbook or befrugal about

580
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
Organizing my finances

581
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
So you really ought to get a

582
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Aboki price why do have one

583
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
Really what

584
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
Let me sit down with him or the next time I'm in town I'm like all right

585
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
Remember we sat down with the with the bookkeeper

586
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
And he was blown away

587
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Looks like this thing is really

588
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Efficient

589
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Making a lot of money and

590
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
Continue to get busier and busier and busier

591
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,656
And then everybody started asking me when I was going to open up the next Chipotle

592
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Were you still in your mind

593
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Planning and

594
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
It on opening a fine dining restaurant

595
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
Oh that was what I was thinking about Usher

596
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
And I had no intention of opening another Chipotle

597
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
And

598
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Maybe I'll open one more

599
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
I called my dad and I said you know everybody pressuring me

600
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
All right

601
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
Soap

602
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,912
Think maybe he put in a little bit more money but it was mostly cash flow that open II restaurant

603
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,472
And that opened about a year-and-a-half later

604
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
It opened up

605
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
Much busier than the first one

606
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
It was extraordinary

607
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
And so

608
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Good alright

609
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Elephant one more

610
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Wow

611
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
In all in Denver

612
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,064
Home Depot pricing list

613
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
3 in Denver

614
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,720
That's one of my dad's questions

615
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,024
Denver connect two of these

616
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
I think so.

617
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
Analysa 1 / 50000

618
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
At what point is

619
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,752
I mean to somebody say or do you say or

620
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
What do you think

621
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
Maybe this is it maybe this is the thing that's going to

622
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,968
That we should be pursuing maybe we maybe this is bigger than just

623
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
Well so that happened after I had

624
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Dozen restaurant

625
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
Maybe less maybe 8

626
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Honestly I

627
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
I forget

628
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
But I thought I would go to Kansas City

629
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
It seems like a neat Foodtown

630
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
People really into

631
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
BBQ

632
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Strong BBQ kosher there

633
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
I like that and I thought there

634
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Burrito culture

635
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
For 2

636
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
And so

637
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
You know it didn't open up

638
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Super strong

639
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,224
But it did pretty well and did you was at the idea to do but you just going to keep it

640
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Expanding like one sore after another

641
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Well

642
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
The idea of expansion

643
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
It wasn't about

644
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
Building an empire

645
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
It wasn't a number I was going after I never thought oh my gosh if I

646
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
If I could only have

647
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,840
You know 10 restaurants or 20 or 50 or a hundred or thousand

648
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Was never

649
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,448
Was never like that but I mean you were still expanding so how are you

650
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
How are you finding that

651
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
My my dad

652
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Funded the first restaurant

653
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
And then I started

654
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Signing up leases

655
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
Restaurant 4 5 6

656
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,576
7th and then I went to my dad I said you know I'm signing up Lisa's I think I'm going to

657
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Need

658
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
A cash infusion

659
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Would you like to invest

660
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
And luckily

661
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Yes

662
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
We open those restaurants

663
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Successful

664
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
And I symbol

665
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
I'm going to continue to open up some more

666
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
Would you like to invest again and he said

667
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
Why don't you go raise the money yourself

668
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
And I said well how do you do that

669
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
Why you need to write a business plan and you have to

670
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
No go pitch it to

671
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
People who are

672
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:06,528
Qualified to invest clear that you would already had a bunch of stores at this point you did not have a business plan

673
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
No no

674
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,880
Georgia was no business making burritos

675
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
I was I was just making this up as I as I as I went along

676
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
And

677
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Remember I

678
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
I hired

679
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
A college buddy

680
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Who

681
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
Went off to get his MBA

682
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,264
So I hired him in and see what we have to put this business plan together

683
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
And so as we

684
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Put the business plan together what emerged was this

685
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Economic model

686
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Investment

687
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Sales

688
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
The resulting margin did you understand any of that stuff by the way

689
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
I like that didn't as we were contemplating

690
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
The business plan but after having two

691
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Picture

692
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
You know if it was my NBA really

693
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
How to spell is my

694
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Quick and dirty

695
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Business School

696
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
And so

697
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
During the

698
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
The time where I was pitching it I met

699
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
One of our

700
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
Early investors who

701
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Turned out to be a board member

702
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
And and he was really instrumental in helping me understand

703
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
How special

704
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
The economic model was

705
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Chipotle

706
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
What was it about the economic model that was so special

707
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
What was very very efficient

708
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
The investment cost was

709
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Was very low

710
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
And in typical fast-food

711
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Time

712
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Had to have room for a drive-thru

713
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
They're usually

714
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Free-standing

715
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
So all of that

716
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Acquired

717
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Sizable invest

718
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
Chipotle we were going into

719
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Strip malls

720
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Often in the inexpensive

721
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Center

722
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
Units not the more desirable end caps

723
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
It was early on

724
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
The investment was very very modest

725
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
And

726
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Our

727
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880
Production system or the first service format really was an assembly line and as

728
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
Volumes increased as we serve more customers you you would get a higher and higher margin.

729
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Contribution margin in soap

730
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
The resulting Returns on investment were extraordinary and again nothing

731
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
Like this in the in the restaurant industry at the time did you go to like private Equity companies or venture

732
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,224
I did so I I I started to go to institutions

733
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
And then one of my initial investors albelda key suggested that I

734
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
I I send a plan to McDonald's and he had met someone in McDonald's that was thinking about new

735
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
Restaurant ideas

736
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
I thought well that's

737
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
Really bad idea how

738
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
You know Chipotle McDonald's are so completely different just send them a plan see what happens

739
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
So I did

740
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,872
And within a few weeks

741
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
I got a call and a visit

742
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
And a couple of weeks later I got another call and they said don't can we bring some more people and is that kept going on for

743
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
About a year

744
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
It culminated in a visit from the CEO and their CFO

745
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
What is a eventually made an offer

746
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
2

747
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,400
To invest in Chipotle did they want to buy it out

748
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
Right. I think they wanted to buy it outright and I wasn't

749
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
I was willing to sell

750
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
And so they made a very

751
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Very small investment

752
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Enough to

753
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
Open a few restaurants in

754
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,248
And and then they can open the annually they would do it put in more money

755
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Over a seven-year period I think

756
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Put in 300

757
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,624
60 million dollars or so but the majority of that was in the last

758
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
McDonald's investment which Maven tiny for that

759
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Multibillion-dollar company

760
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
That cash infusion for you guys

761
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
With tens of millions of dollars that was

762
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Transformational

763
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Completely it wasn't there was no

764
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
Mean I was very lucky in that

765
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't think there's anyone else who would have been able to invest

766
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
That way

767
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
And bet on the come

768
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
And what I mean by that is

769
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
You know we open some markets

770
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,064
California's great example where sales were really

771
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,136
Soft and in the restaurants were making money

772
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
But McDonald's was very patient

773
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,792
And and they believe that the sales would come in in some of the markets

774
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Softer

775
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
And indeed they did

776
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,728
Should they eat they basically put in some money and that means McDonald's had a chunk of the owner of the company

777
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
Point right on the majority of the

778
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,640
Company toward the end of the 7-year.

779
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
But

780
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
As we develop a relationship over

781
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
The years

782
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
We realize that

783
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
You know

784
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
Our way of doing things was more appropriate

785
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,720
Then what their system had to offer yeah because you guys

786
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Do things like Source your meat

787
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
From a specific

788
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:38,144
Ranch farm with you found this Ranch that have a free-range pigs and

789
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Do what you want with them rice

790
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Right

791
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
I was reading a

792
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Quarterly magazine

793
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
Call The Art of eating

794
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,664
This particular issue that I was reading was about

795
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Diamond Ranch

796
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
And the pork

797
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Farms

798
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
In Thornton Iowa

799
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
And at the time I was reading this I was

800
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,696
Thinking about changing the recipe for our carnitas

801
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
And so

802
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
As I was reading this article

803
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
I was learning about

804
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Yeah you know the way they

805
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,936
They raised their pics which I guess it was much different than

806
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
The typical way that

807
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
The Bix race

808
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
And United States

809
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
Vast majority of pork

810
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
That is raised in confinement

811
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
So if you contrast that with

812
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
With what I saw at

813
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
At 9 Ranch

814
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
That means just

815
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
Such a stark contrast

816
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
After sampling

817
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Airport I decided that I wanted to

818
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Switch all of my

819
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Reply to Diamond Ranch

820
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
The year to get there eventually we did

821
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
It was McDonald's ever saying to you hey look you know that I make

822
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
Sense that you're buying you know

823
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
These expensive

824
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
Look at our supply chain coefficient is

825
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
You know you can save a lot of money could

826
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Increase

827
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
Profit margin

828
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
You know why they would ask questions

829
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Not dissimilar from the questions

830
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
You asked but they would see the results

831
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
So are you know

832
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
I remember when I put Diamond Ranch pork

833
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
On the menu

834
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
I had to increase the

835
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
The price of the car needs

836
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Burrito and I think

837
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Increase by about a dollar or something

838
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm so in the world of fast food

839
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
That was just not

840
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Understood

841
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
I mean remember this is the time when fast-food had the the 59 7999

842
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
9 price point

843
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
That was a Taco Bell in the

844
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
And the dollar value mint

845
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Can you add things like this

846
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
Here here I am raising the price

847
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Carnitas burrito by dollar

848
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
And after we did that

849
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
We started selling more

850
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Carnitas burritos

851
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Obviously your business approach

852
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
And there's word

853
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Totally

854
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
I would imagine

855
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
You were

856
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
You weren't going to last

857
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Partnership

858
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Forever race

859
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
Right

860
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Well

861
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:54,080
So McDonald's has a very strong franchise and their franchisees

862
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
I'm obviously wanted one or two part of Chipotle

863
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
And

864
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
If you have certainly they would have been capable of

865
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
Of operating Chipotle

866
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,600
Are there out there a lot of good operators in McDonald's

867
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
But the economic model

868
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
So good

869
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,024
That we wanted to own it and you did not want to franchise a business

870
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
We didn't

871
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
That was that was

872
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Perhaps

873
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Biggest point of

874
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Right

875
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
McDonald's

876
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
You know sort of had a duty to their franchisees.

877
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
To offer Chipotle

878
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
As as a as a growth vehicle

879
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
It just did it wasn't going to be a fifth

880
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
And we felt like we were ready to

881
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
To go your own way

882
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
The expansion of

883
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Chipotle was

884
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
Unbelievable I mean after that McDonald's

885
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Investment it was like

886
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
It was like a rocket

887
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
You know I mean in everybody and their

888
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
And their brother and sisters wanted to

889
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Create the next Chipotle

890
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,288
How did that affect your your personal life I mean

891
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
Would we just like on top of the world

892
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
So

893
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Signs about this or were you

894
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
Stressed out about the

895
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
That's cuz you went from 13

896
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
3500 stores

897
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Very quickly and then

898
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
From 500 stores to

899
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Thousands now but

900
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
Did you

901
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Enjoy that was addict

902
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Exciting or

903
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
We overwhelmed ever

904
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,608
So if you think about my original plan for Chipotle

905
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Yes

906
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
I failed

907
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
Okay cuz my intention was to 2

908
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
To start

909
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
One little Chipotle

910
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
And then to be able to step away from it

911
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
And in use the funds from that restaurant

912
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
To open and operate my full-scale restaurant

913
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
So

914
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,296
Failed because I never stepped away

915
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Chipotle

916
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
I don't

917
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
I don't think I took a day off

918
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
In the first year

919
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
The only time I left

920
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Was when I had to

921
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
To run out

922
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Take the money to

923
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
The banker

924
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Go to a

925
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Suppliers

926
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,984
Certainly do a stress to it but it was really exciting

927
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
On the other hand though as it

928
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
As it got bigger

929
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,360
And the challenges Scott

930
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
Much larger the challenges of operating a large

931
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Business

932
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
I just always wondered if I was

933
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Qualified song

934
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Business School

935
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
I didn't think of myself

936
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
CEO

937
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Eleanor the Meg

938
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Learn to do this

939
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
So so there was a lot of gout

940
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
Self-doubt alarm

941
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Cuz it would be I would not

942
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
I want to feel confident that you didn't have sec

943
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Your your chef

944
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
And you are all of a sudden

945
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
The Helm of this

946
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,128
Massive growing Empire

947
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Cons of employees

948
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Scaling quickly

949
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,552
Deal with personnel and management all the stuff

950
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,856
I'll give you what you learn along the way

951
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
And there have been so many

952
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
Transformations along the way

953
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
And so for the last 24 years

954
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
It's about

955
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
You know Reinventing

956
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
Yourself

957
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400
In a learning new things

958
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
But I got

959
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Good at finding

960
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,360
Really good people I think I think that's probably what I'm best at

961
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
So you go public

962
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Fisher Price

963
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Skyrockets and

964
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Legacy Inn

965
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
In mm

966
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
And then you have a

967
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Pretty

968
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
15

969
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
What was

970
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
That like for you to

971
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
Kentucky

972
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
What was outside

973
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Sure about that

974
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
You know that anyone would get sick

975
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
From the food that

976
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
That you

977
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Serve them

978
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,616
We're really a tough thing and

979
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
So I immediately

980
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Yeah you know we try to figure out

981
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
What could be causing this

982
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
And it was it was a very difficult thing

983
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
To figure out

984
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
And there were a lot of experts

985
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
We brought on immediately and end in a

986
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
CDC in lhasa

987
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Investigations

988
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
This started in August

989
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Pacific Northwest

990
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
Young people got

991
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Sick from from

992
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,472
So so yeah over over one month.

993
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,080
From basically mid-october to mid-november

994
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
52 people

995
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
I got sick with E coli

996
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Will you freaking out

997
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Well

998
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
I mean

999
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
We got no freaking out has the right

1000
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
The right way to describe it

1001
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
You know we were

1002
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Really

1003
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
But I was just it was

1004
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
All encompass

1005
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
It was like

1006
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
It was really intense

1007
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,096
You don't know you wouldn't wish this on

1008
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
On anybody

1009
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Back up and think about it

1010
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
No nobody was bringing in as much

1011
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Fresh

1012
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Food as much

1013
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Fresh produce and meat

1014
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
As Chipotle

1015
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
So what we realize

1016
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
How is that we needed to

1017
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Develop protocols

1018
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Prevent any kind of

1019
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Pathogen vim

1020
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm coming into the system

1021
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Impossible to do

1022
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
100%

1023
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,952
You can never say 100%

1024
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,768
Yeah but you can you can get very close to

1025
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
2-0

1026
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
So yeah I'll give you an example

1027
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
I think about an avocado

1028
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Potentially

1029
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,984
Pathogens on an avocado

1030
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
But you wash the avocado right the avocado was washed

1031
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
After his Harvest

1032
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
But what if

1033
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
That

1034
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Avocado

1035
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
Could be infected somehow

1036
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Falls on the ground and hits

1037
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,416
It's a little rock or something and that and just that little spot where the pathogen is pushed under the skin

1038
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,464
And now you wash it but you

1039
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
You don't watch that little spot and what if

1040
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,584
As you put your knife into the avocado

1041
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
It's that exact

1042
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,824
110 million things I cut at home and I don't wash them

1043
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
That's right if you you have dozens

1044
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
We cut millions millions

1045
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,016
And I'm not saying that the avocado is rotten

1046
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
Responsible for for this

1047
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
La particular incident

1048
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,416
But we've looked at every single

1049
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,256
Item we bring in and we've ensured that there are

1050
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
A number of interventions along the way and see what we do with this Avocado now is after we wash it

1051
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
We plunge it into boiling water for 5 seconds

1052
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,080
Yeah and it's not long enough to cook the avocado

1053
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
But just long enough to bring the temperature

1054
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,296
Of the skin and the area under the skin just high enough so that it would kill any

1055
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,112
Pathogen that might be there we do this with

1056
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,928
Lemons and limes and bell peppers

1057
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,256
Jalapeno peppers is a process that is

1058
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,584
Very very thorough and in the chance that

1059
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
Pathogen can survive through that

1060
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,960
Is certainly near-zero

1061
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,520
Did you have this incredible

1062
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Rotten from the

1063
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,848
Literally from the first store you open

1064
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Profitable

1065
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
And then you hit this crisis point in

1066
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
2015 and

1067
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
I can't imagine you ever dealt with anything

1068
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
Even remotely close to that

1069
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
So

1070
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
What are you mentally prepared for it

1071
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
Well you should own I'm here now so I got to go

1072
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
Got through it

1073
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
We weren't

1074
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
We weren't

1075
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Prepared

1076
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
As an organization

1077
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
For it obviously

1078
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,799
Nnn since that incident

1079
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
For two years away from

1080
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
We are at we are a different company

1081
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
We have

1082
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Top notch

1083
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
Board of directors

1084
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
That are

1085
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
Independent and

1086
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Very critical

1087
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
In a good way

1088
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Challenging way

1089
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
And and we are

1090
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Prepared

1091
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Now

1092
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
4

1093
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
A lot of success

1094
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
I mean what would you think of that

1095
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Devaluation

1096
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
The company this number

1097
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,287
It's taken a little bit of a beating because

1098
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
ICC face

1099
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
It was what like

1100
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
420 billion dollars

1101
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,223
The 2121 billion I think

1102
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
Highest winning 1 billion.

1103
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
For a burrito

1104
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,647
Restaurant started in Denver in 1993

1105
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Pretty insane

1106
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
You know when you think about that

1107
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
I already sit back and say

1108
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,399
Wow how awesome is that or you don't even

1109
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,031
It doesn't really work that way if it's not big stair step

1110
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Increases

1111
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,431
It's relatively linear you know and inserted just

1112
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,831
Get getting bigger taken on more responsibility the evaluation officer things

1113
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,463
Empty sink and into is it that amount of money just abstract

1114
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
Is it mean anything I mean that cuz I would sink

1115
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,727
I would be incredibly proud of that you know that that you grow this thing to such a

1116
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,055
Huge place

1117
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,871
So again I've always

1118
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,175
When I before I started the first restaurant

1119
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,551
I used to tell people that I wanted to show that just because food is sore fast

1120
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Doesn't mean it has to be at 2

1121
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Typical fast-food experience

1122
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
And that evolved

1123
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
2

1124
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,511
Saying that I want to change the way Americans think about

1125
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Any fast food

1126
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
And

1127
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,655
I remember when I started saying that we weren't very big

1128
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
That that sounded like

1129
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Big

1130
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Audacious goal

1131
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,103
But but the basic idea behind our purpose

1132
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Is that

1133
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Food that's raised right should be

1134
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Peoples

1135
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
Everyday Food

1136
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
And as I see others

1137
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Who have

1138
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
Open restaurants

1139
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
That are based on

1140
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Chipotle model

1141
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
I'm very excited about that

1142
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
That's that's what

1143
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
That's what drives us

1144
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
How much of of your success

1145
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
You think it's because of locking

1146
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Your hard-working

1147
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
So

1148
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
You know my

1149
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Success

1150
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
In the early days

1151
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Was

1152
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
I think I

1153
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Caused

1154
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
A lot of that

1155
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Success

1156
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
But

1157
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
I then have to layer on being in the right place at the

1158
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
I was lucky to

1159
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
To have a father who could

1160
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,095
Who could invest $85,000 in my first restaurant because I couldn't have raised that money myself

1161
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
That

1162
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
McDonald's

1163
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Allowed me to

1164
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Basically

1165
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Run the company and tap into their resources

1166
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
No it's a combination

1167
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
Also a lot of it is a

1168
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
If I

1169
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
I go back to this

1170
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
This concept that I learned in cooking school

1171
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,623
It's this French term called Museum + everything is right place and everything in its place and it's and it's basically

1172
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
Now you could think about it

1173
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:53,791
You know before service you have your music Lawson and that means that one service starts everything you need for

1174
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
A successful service

1175
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Is laid out

1176
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Just so

1177
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,215
Yeah and and so I think about

1178
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
I think about

1179
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
You know my

1180
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Overall mise-en-place

1181
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
Setup setup set myself up for success

1182
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,919
And that seemed to make sense for me

1183
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,783
Steve Ells founder of

1184
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Chipotle by the way despite the fact

1185
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,439
Steve could finally fulfill his dream and open up that high-end restaurant

1186
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
He says that moment has

1187
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Kind of pasta

1188
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,607
Besides there's a lot of money still to be made in burritos

1189
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,447
Chipotle stores sell close to two hundred thousand of them

1190
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
Every single hour

1191
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:55,487
And please do stick around because it just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things you are building

1192
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1196
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,575
And our story today comes to us from Alexander hurry

1197
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,671
He grew up in New York City and sisters would sit down for meals

1198
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
It was always

1199
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
One thing one condiment on the table

1200
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
That they

1201
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,167
Ready much slathered on everything they ate would put it on baked potatoes all the time

1202
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:40,543
We would have it in yogurts we have it on Chicken on bagels and cream cheese on eggs

1203
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,383
On Burgers which magical condiment

1204
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,991
Actually tastes good on all of these different things Geathers their sriracha

1205
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,807
Besides sriracha za'atar

1206
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:58,207
Zaatar is this Tangy earthy Middle Eastern Spice made with different types of time abc

1207
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,047
Oregano other spices like acumen

1208
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Sage

1209
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:09,471
Some sesame seeds even chickpeas I mean it is a cultural food staple and you're asking me

1210
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,335
Eastern Parson do you know what za'atar is it's like asking an American do you know what apple pie is

1211
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:20,735
He wait a few years ago Alexander who happens to be of Lebanese to send started to notice is that our wishes

1212
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
Showing up an all of these unexpected places like

1213
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,439
In corner hipster restaurants on Instagram on social media

1214
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Sounds like no way

1215
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:36,863
Za'atar becoming a thing yes in some parts of the countries that are was becoming a thing

1216
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,447
Alexander wondered why nobody made it the way his mom did

1217
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
Mixing the spices with olive oil into a spread it brings out the flavor of

1218
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,919
Herbs to know the essence of the herbs out more

1219
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
And condiments are cool

1220
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
Everybody loves condiments right so I was thinking about all of this last year and at the same time he was working at a res

1221
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Search firm on Wall Street

1222
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,207
The job he wasn't really crazy about

1223
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Until one night

1224
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
He was having dinner at his parents place. Are was of course on the table and I'm looking down my head between

1225
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
My arms telling them what's going on and boom

1226
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
It just hit me I'm staring at

1227
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
And I said

1228
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
I got it

1229
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,223
It's his light bulb moment Alexander says we have got to make za'atar the way you make it mom and wiishu

1230
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,623
Should sell it like as a spread we've been eating these foods are whole life we always joke about it we should have started hummus or we should have

1231
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,951
Who started Greek yogurt

1232
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
So he much later Alexander walked away from his job

1233
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,583
He moved back in with his parents

1234
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
You found an industrial kitchen he Googled where to find the spices the olive oil the little glass jars

1235
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
He made his first batch of spreadable za'atar and he started going door-to-door to sell it to specialty store

1236
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,247
Stores in New York I had these little gift bags I had a jar zesty Z pita chips recipe

1237
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,551
Chevy cars in our sales sheet and I walk in

1238
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,623
And say hey I think I've got a great product or customers would like

1239
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:08,767
And I'll follow up in a week with you and when he did follow up in a week a lot of people said

1240
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,863
No no we don't like this we don't think this will sell you don't like the taste

1241
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
Sarah Sarah Sarah

1242
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,799
Dealing with that you know people who say that it's business it's not personal whoever came up with that

1243
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
A quote that says that

1244
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
Never started a business because I would disagree with that for sure after he got all those

1245
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
I got an email saying thank you so much for the thoughtful package we absolutely love this will take two cases

1246
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:41,279
And when I got that email starts cry from their Alexander started they get a bit more traction

1247
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
He's now selling his za'atar spread on Amazon and in Whole Food stores in New York City and he hopes to

1248
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Band even more I want to share what I ate growing up with everybody else and that's what I want to do with my life

1249
00:50:54,335 --> 00:51:00,479
Alexander says he's made a healthy six figures enough to pay himself a small salary and

1250
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
Move out of his parents place

1251
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,623
Alexander's company is called zesty Z the za'atar company

1252
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,671
