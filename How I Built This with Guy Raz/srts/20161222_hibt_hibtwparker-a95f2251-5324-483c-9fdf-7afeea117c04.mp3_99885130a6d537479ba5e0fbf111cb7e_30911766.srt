Support for NPR comes from investor.gov

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Presenting this mess

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When it comes to investing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
We all have Quest

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
And investor.gov has answers

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,008
If you're free resource

Tools tips and information

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
In about investing

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Before you invest

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Investor.gov

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
We haven't told anyone that the site was lie if you just want to drive any traffic to it because we were

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
I get an order and then 10 minutes later we get another order

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
And then another order and then another order and kind of go from there

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
This feeling of elatement a crap

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,408
From NPR it's how I built this

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
Nashoba innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movement since they built

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Gyros and

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
Founders of Warby Parker tell the story of how they burst and idea and idea

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,936
Disrupted the entire eyeglass industry in America

20
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
I grew into a billion dollar Temple

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
So back in 2008 and Eagle Blumenthal and Dave gilboa first arrived on the campus

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania they were there to start business school and they met each other and

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Two other students Andy Hunt and Jeff Raider the for them would go on to co-found Warby Parker butt into

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
2008 that time they didn't know that yet but they did know something that they all had in common was they were really

25
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Frustrated with how eyeglasses worked its stem from this thing that will most people

26
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Probably experienced at some point they kept losing their glasses and Dave and backed right before

27
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
Start a business school at accidentally left his glasses

28
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
An airplane and it cost me $700

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,696
And I just couldn't justify the full-time student paying that much for a new pair of glasses

30
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah the new iPhone 3-g had come out that way didn't lie at the Apple Store paid $200 for and it did

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
All these magical things

32
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,984
And meanwhile the technology behind a pair of glasses is 800 years old in

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,872
It just didn't make sense but you're like okay I've got this amazing iPhone this magical

34
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,272
Portal 2 all of you knowledge eyeglasses made out of

35
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Plastic

36
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Are like

37
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Super expensive

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
Yes it was complaining to anyone that would listen about why glasses were so expensive and then Andy kept losing

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
His glasses

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
And you was buying everything online but couldn't figure out why you can buy new glasses online

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Effectively sunglasses on my right because this like 2008 and I mean by that point

42
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,176
He likes selling things online with his brand new idea

43
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
We kind of started this conversation where we are

44
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
Kind of frustrated by different

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Pieces of the eyewear industry

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
And we knew that Neil had spent a number of years

47
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
I'm working for an hour non profit and

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
And probably knew a lot more about this than we did and so

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
We're on the computer lab one day

50
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
And that we started asking me a bunch of questions and

51
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,264
No pun intended but any color eyes are open that there was a massive opportunity

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
What do you remember about that

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Being in the computer lab me I would like over there

54
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
It was

55
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
So like why are glasses so expensive then

56
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
When I was working at nonprofit visionspring I've actually designed eyewear and I would go to the factory

57
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Mapreduce

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
Glasses in

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
So I knew a little bit about the optical in

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Australian

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,328
And it's dominated by a few very large companies one of which is

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Luxottica

63
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Exotic as a marker

64
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
The cap about 30 billion dollars

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
They

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
Jamon Oakley Ray-Ban Oliver Peoples persol and Arnett

67
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,432
They license almost every major fashion brand Under the song like Ralph Lauren and Shannon Allen

68
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Prada Dolce & Gabbana

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
They also own a lot of the major retail chains like

70
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
LensCrafters and Pearle Vision and Sunglass Hut

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Company owns

72
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,768
All those things have crazy Sears Optical Target Optical

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
The store and all those brands

74
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Persol Rayban

75
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
All owned by the same company owned by the same company end

76
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,751
They on the second largest vision insurance plan in the country eyemed

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
So

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
You walk into a LensCrafters you don't realize that

79
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
Mustache election

80
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Car frame

81
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Games that they've made

82
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
And the vision shirt

83
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
So you knew that

84
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Exactly

85
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
So we just thought like a

86
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Well now

87
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
It's a lot clearer why

88
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
Glasses are so expensive

89
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
So we thought

90
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Why not

91
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Glasses

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
The light bulbs went off

93
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Turn all of our minds

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
And then later that night

95
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
Let you know when you have a feeling at or just an idea you're so excited about you actually have trouble sleeping

96
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Exactly

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
It was that

98
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Feeling

99
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
It was like 2 in the morning

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
Shut off an email

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,183
And then I'd like to a one-day responded and 202 Jefferson an 80 responded in like we were all

102
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Up thinking about

103
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Next day

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
We decide hey

105
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375
After class let's all get together and when she sat down at a bar right on

106
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
23rd and Walnut

107
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Andover beer

108
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
We're discussing this more

109
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Hand

110
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Should we do this

111
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
Should we really go after this and we also said yeah

112
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
How do you say you guys are

113
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Business school and you're thinking okay let's do this

114
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Play quite a business plan that you start looking for money I think all of us we talked about how it's

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Decided we were about this idea and he said while we're at business school to learn how to write a business what better way than to actually build on

116
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
On ourselves so

117
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,919
We all decide to take the same class in entrepreneurship class

118
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Without thought of that class is edible business plan and we spent the next several weeks

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Really researching every element of

120
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,255
Or idea getting a bunch of great insights from professors

121
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
Running a bunch of surveys standing for hours in

122
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Different optical shops in

123
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,703
And then that culminated in Playa 40 page business plan

124
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
We entered the Wharton business plan competition and we got eliminate

125
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
In the semifinal round

126
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
They just kind of put a chip on her shoulder

127
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
Where we sat okay well now we got something to prove

128
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
And

129
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
At that point we felt really passionate that

130
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
This is going to work that point you're still working out

131
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Taper Avenue

132
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
You still did not have

133
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Any money I'm assuming

134
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
I even have a product

135
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
You didn't have a manufacturer so

136
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Why were you guys for concert

137
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
How are you even able

138
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
The test the idea

139
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
Yeah we talked to everyone that

140
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
I will get us 5 minutes

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
Just about the idea initially we got a bunch of push back but said

142
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
Well gaddiya buying glasses online is

143
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Kind of strange to me

144
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
Kahoot

145
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Basically all our friends

146
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Classmates

147
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
And a lot of people told us that

148
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Creating a brand is hard enough

149
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
So is creating an

150
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
E-commerce site

151
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
You should pick one of those but for us the magic

152
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
And creating a bird

153
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Greater brand

154
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
I'm so behind in on this issue that we had to figure out a way

155
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
People can try on glass

156
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
People are saying

157
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
Nobody's going to buy glasses online because you

158
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
You got a touch of your

159
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Feel them

160
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Exactly

161
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
Surreal moment of self-doubt

162
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Journeys are always these moments where

163
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
You feel like a complete

164
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Play the idiot

165
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
I this was like

166
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
One of those challenges.

167
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Really made us question

168
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Should we continue to spend time on this versus

169
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
The million other things that week

170
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Can be doing at school

171
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
So how did you

172
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Thank you to get over

173
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
People

174
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
You know thinking they needed to touch

175
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Going to try them on

176
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
So we just thought a lot about how do we

177
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Remove every Ops

178
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
The call to purchasing

179
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
And the thought was well if we offer

180
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Free shipping that will encourage people to buy food

181
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Free returns

182
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
That will also

183
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Make it less risky for our customers and that's

184
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
Should have led us to this other idea to do a home try-on program

185
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
So you guys decide

186
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
Let's send these people let them try them

187
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
And they like them

188
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
They just send them back and we'll put the lenses in and that's it

189
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
Did you guys have any other problems that you

190
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Anticipated

191
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
As you wish

192
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
True

193
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
This idea

194
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Yeah I think the other element was that

195
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,639
We were trying to sell a product normally cost several hundred dollars

196
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
And

197
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
We were telling

198
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
For less than

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
$100 into

200
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
There was inherent skepticism about the

201
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
The quality

202
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Right inside WeChat log

203
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
How do we

204
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Just get as many of our glasses on

205
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
This is possible

206
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Yeah man

207
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
That's when

208
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
This light bulb went off

209
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Program what's really no

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
No company

211
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
I was offering

212
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
Until that time and

213
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Beside we just want to get

214
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Are products on

215
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
People's faces in

216
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Can people by afterwards

217
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
So so so you guys wanted your glasses

218
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Obviously be much

219
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Even less than a hundred bucks

220
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
How

221
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
How did you do

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Decide on the exact

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Price

224
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Our initial thought was

225
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
What's the sell glasses for $45

226
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,927
We remember going into the head of the marketing Department's office at Wharton

227
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
And we sit next to him Slide the deck on his desk and say hey

228
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Where can I transform the odds

229
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Pickle industry

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
We're going to charge $45 for a $500 pair of glasses

231
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
Have any kind just laughed at us and said no I won't work

232
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
Like you didn't even like retard act like every graph goes up and to the right

233
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
And he said

234
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
I'm sorry guys I

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
First of all

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Prices

237
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Is the biggest in the

238
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Decatur air quality

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,855
And it's just outside of the realm of believability that you can sell a product

240
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
410

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Let's price

242
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
So we walked out of this meeting pretty deflated

243
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
But it led us

244
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
To investigate pricing a little further

245
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
It showed us

246
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
That yes prices

247
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,239
Time indicator quality there's a psychological barrier around $100

248
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
So one thought what should we charge $99 and

249
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
We thought that was too discounting and cheap and we were

250
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
Building an aspirational brand

251
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
So we actually settled on $95

252
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Using just our instinct

253
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Thinking that this stuff

254
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
It sounds cheap and that it looks deliberate and

255
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Officially love

256
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
What's decent

257
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
How did you guys come up with

258
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
Because it sounds like like a an aristocrat from like

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Northumberland

260
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
In England or something like

261
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Warby Parker

262
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
The hardest thing that we did in those early days was

263
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Set 11 a.m. that all four of us liked

264
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Still have our spreadsheet. Over 2000

265
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Names that we tested

266
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
On our very patient friends

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Yeah

268
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
Too early Jack Kerouac characters

269
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
That Dave actually discovered

270
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
When he went to the New York Public Library exhibit on Cadillac

271
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
And to the characters were Warby pepper

272
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
And Zack Parker

273
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
And that's it

274
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Everybody that

275
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167

Hey welcome back to how I built this

305
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
From NPR on gaara's and Taylor show we've got Neil Blumenthal and Dave gilboa two of the founders of Warby

306
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Parker

307
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Come up with this idea and they

308
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Thought it through and

309
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Now

310
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
The only thing left

311
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
What's the exit

312
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
How much money do

313
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Did you guys raise initially

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
And how did you do it

315
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
So the next thing about business school was that most people work

316
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
For a few years before going back to school and so

317
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Collectively the four of us 2

318
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
The car life savings from

319
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
When we were working before school and invested into the business

320
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
We invested $120,000 between the four of us

321
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
To get the business

322
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Stop the ground

323
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Yeah we work for year-and-a-half

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
I pay myself a salary we didn't have an office

325
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
We did win a couple of Grants from Morton to that that helped as well.

326
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
We were very Scrappy and

327
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Famous bootstrap

328
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Quite a while and we ended up

329
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
Launching a business and then when

330
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Another 15 months

331
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Before we

332
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Raise our first round of funding

333
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
The Hedgehog

334
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,583
Ashley find the manufacturer to make the glass

335
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
I mean did you kneel to have contacts from

336
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
When you work at that

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Nonprofit

338
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Yeah

339
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
We leverage allowed the relationships that I had then

340
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
To visit

341
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Is the factories

342
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
And we actually

343
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Prepared

344
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
A PowerPoint

345
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Because even though

346
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
This was going to be a vendor that we are

347
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Buying from

348
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
We have to sell them on our vision and that we weren't

349
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Did Sirius and

350
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
How far

351
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
To pay them

352
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Forsyth Tech

353
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
Monthly payment upfront

354
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Okay so you pay for these frames

355
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
The manufacturer makes

356
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
And what did you even

357
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
2 with all those glasses

358
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
To remember

359
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Getting boxes and boxes of these frames

360
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Ship to

361
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,711
Are apartment admin I fit with the doorman building the doorman had

362
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
No idea what to do it literally took us

363
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
A couple hours to load

364
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Do all these runs

365
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
In the elevator

366
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Into our apartment

367
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Then stack all these

368
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
And then unpack them and we

369
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Ourselves

370
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Inspected

371
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Every single frame

372
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
And this was all the while

373
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
We were

374
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Working two

375
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Figure out

376
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
How are we going to watch it

377
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
We basically

378
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Need to start the business only ambassador

379
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Free things

380
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Our initial inventory

381
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Our website

382
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
And some PR

383
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Knowing that you'll

384
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
One shot

385
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Sort of launch

386
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
A brand

387
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Even before you

388
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
You launch the company

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
You had a publicist going out trying to

390
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
To drum up publicity for

391
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Had meetings with

392
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Almost 50 PR

393
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Part of it was us evaluating them but

394
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
I'm at the same time we had to sell ourselves to the

395
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
PR firm

396
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
Nothing less sexy in the fashion world than for mbas for Morton

397
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
We knew we were going to launch

398
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Sometime in the spring

399
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
2010

400
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
And we really wanted

401
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
How to be in

402
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Premiere magazine doesn't

403
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Approval

404
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Sowa

405
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
What we were targeting

406
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
And so

407
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
We had some production samples

408
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
We didn't have a website up

409
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
But we were really pitching

410
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Harvey's bags

411
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Asean zaz

412
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
Exclusive Lounge partners

413
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
We were

414
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Thrilled to hear that she

415
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
GQ envogue we're going to run stories we have no idea

416
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
The stories were to look like with the content was going to look like

417
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
I mean

418
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Why would these huge magazine

419
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Lake Trust

420
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
A bunch of

421
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Business school students

422
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,855
Didn't even have a company like if you went to the website at that point there was nothing up there like

423
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Crazy to think that they would have done that right

424
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
I can do a few things at work in our favor right one was

425
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Identifying

426
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
The right

427
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
PR

428
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Person to help rapper

429
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
Persona 5 we often say that

430
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Tiaras

431
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Like 30% the messenger 70%

432
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
The message

433
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Address the message

434
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
This is a

435
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Pretty novel at the time right there was

436
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
Nobody selling glasses online so the idea of selling glasses

437
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Online was novel

438
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
That $95 price point for $500 glasses

439
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Funny novel

440
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
The home try-on program was novel so in fact

441
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
GQ actually called us in that play

442
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
But I wear in the article that they put

443
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
So I think they were

444
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,631
Like these hooks that writers and editors could get excited about

445
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
So how much of an impact did that

446
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Did that have on

447
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Yeah we we were

448
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Just blown away by that

449
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Impact that it hadn't

450
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
The traffic in sales so

451
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
We got a call from

452
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Are publicist

453
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
The day before

454
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
He was going to hit newsstands and we still had a landing page up

455
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,343
He went to warbyparker.com it said coming soon

456
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,183
Please enter your email address

457
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
GQ sitting tomorrow

458
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
And our website

459
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
Still had a bunch of bugs in it we are working

460
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
With one developer

461
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
And we were on the phone with him kind of frantically

462
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
Working out some of the most critical

463
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Bugs

464
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
On the site

465
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
And we finally at 4 a.m. Saturday

466
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
God's verses

467
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Stable enough

468
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
We all need a couple hours of sleep before

469
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
For we have class tomorrow

470
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
And

471
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
We were sitting in class the next day

472
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
We haven't told anyone that the site was live our

473
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Parents didn't know the site was live our best friend's didn't know the site was live

474
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,607
But we didn't want to drive any traffic to it because we weren't sure it would wear

475
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Had my phone set up to

476
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
Be notified anytime we got an order

477
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
And those around 10 a.m.

478
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
And so I get an order and

479
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,199
A 10 minutes later we get another order and then another order and then another order and kind of

480
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
Go from this feeling of elatement

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,647
Oh crap we have to have business inventory

482
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,791
And we hadn't contemplated building in any sold-out functionality or weightless functionality of the site

483
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,959
So you are literally selling out of glasses but people still ordering them because it's the website

484
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
Didn't know when you would run out of there we had no inventory tracking it all because we knew we were assuming one to two orders a day

485
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,455
And got a job that have nothing else my mom would buy a hundred pairs of glasses from us

486
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,575
But we are we really have tempered expectations because we also recognize that what we were trying to do was

487
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Hildebrand

488
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
And that takes a really long time

489
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,255
So we called an emergency meeting after that first hour-and-a-half class and we were debating

490
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
Okay what do we do here or do we just keep taking orders and then figure out what to tell

491
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Bellator do we take down website

492
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
And while we're having this 2 minutes

493
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Discussion and I'm looking at my phone and we have

494
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
10 more orders am I get to delete we got to do something here

495
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
And tell

496
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
We place an emergency call to our developer

497
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
And miraculously was able

498
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
How to build in

499
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
Is weightless functionality on the Fly

500
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
And

501
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Within

502
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,111
4 week. Weed sold out of

503
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Our best-selling

504
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Mixtiles we had to wait list

505
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
20000 customers

506
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Did you guys sell

507
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
Yeah 10000

508
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
What's up

509
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,655
And you just did not I you would not ordered enough glasses from the manufacturer

510
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
You literally

511
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
Couldn't and they couldn't make them fast enough for you

512
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
You know it I think

513
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,383
We were ambitious in terms of the number of frames that we purchased but also

514
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
Not overly

515
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Risk tolerance

516
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
And I think we've

517
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Approach this business in

518
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,135
In a way that yeah that's not bankrupt ourselves on inventory we hadn't raised any money

519
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Investors

520
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
Yeah it was our our life savings that we important so there was

521
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Really a

522
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
A limited number of frame that we have the ability to

523
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
I mean

524
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Like a good problem to have

525
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
That you you have a waitlist

526
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
20000

527
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Volume

528
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Out of the gate

529
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Killing it

530
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Is that am I right or was it actually

531
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
IPad Pro

532
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
I think we've learned a lot of important lessons in

533
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
30 days weather

534
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
We were terrified that

535
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
May we had all these early adopters

536
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Excited to

537
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Place an order from us and we didn't have anything

538
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Need to sell them

539
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
And for a lot of customers that took us

540
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Numbers of 9 months

541
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
To get through the waitlist

542
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
So we were terrified who are these people are going to

543
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Meet with a bad taste in their mouth

544
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
A lot of companies

545
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,335
Yeah and I think it did have some positive effects that it created this aura that

546
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Wow this

547
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Andrea Lee Height

548
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,527
Nothing creates cool like scarcity but I think we also learned

549
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
At 11

550
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
In terms of

551
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Being empathetic to customers

552
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Founders we reached out to everyone on that

553
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Waitlist

554
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Time for

555
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
People that were

556
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Bad experiences were really good

557
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Disappointed meme

558
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Glasses

559

People discounts

560
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
You know what I think

561
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
From the gecko we wanted to create

562
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Have a positive impact on the world and part of that

563
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Is treating

564
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Customers Fair Lady

565
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640

Price

567
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Treating them

568
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Fairly

569
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
When they call up and

570
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
I'm playing

571
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
Bantu apologize and ask

572
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Explain when

573
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Make mistakes and then have something that

574
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
We did from the very beginning

575
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Premier League

576
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
And we're still trying to figure out

577
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
How to run this business

578
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Apartments

579
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Time students

580
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Spark customer service line

581
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
With a Google Voice number that we set up when someone

582
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Call

583
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
It would simultaneously ring all four Founders cell phone

584
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,080
Customer service

585
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
And so we looked at our class schedules and their 12 hours

586
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
4 week when all four of us

587
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Class at the same time

588
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
And

589
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,832
We said it while we should hire someone who can answer the phone when none of us are available

590
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
And so

591
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Will be hired

592
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
The name Rin

593
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
I said you're going to be working 12 hours a week and

594
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Transfer

595
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
We're doing and

596
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
I make that first weeks ended up working

597
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
100 hours

598
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
And now she's running

599
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Our customer experience team what's it about Hunter

600
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
50 people

601
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,800
Antennas as I kind of Off to the Races from day one

602
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
So did you guys I mean how quickly

603
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Did you guys come

604
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Get together to say

605
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Holy hell

606
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
This is real

607
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Can I make it

608
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,464
We were too busy staying up all night responding to customer emails and

609
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,096
I remember when the first couple days like we actually decided to go to one of the classes that we were all in

610
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
And

611
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
We were all typing

612
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Previously on Arkham

613
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,008
Computers cuz we weren't really paying attention and we were just responding to

614
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
The customer email

615
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
How to process orders

616
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm and everything in the classroom got really quiet

617
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Evan the four of us are no luck.

618
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Everybody was staring at us including the professor and here we were typing away when clearly they were done.

619
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Let's to be happy

620
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:28,256
With obvious you are not you are not listed as a we just stopped going to that class

621
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
I mean I remember waking up

622
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Every morning with the laptop on my chest

623
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Because I honestly

624
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Persona cast

625
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
There's an overwhelming amount of work in those early days and so

626
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
We didn't have

627
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
Even a minute to breathe in and take a step back

628
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
And think about what would happen

629
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,480
So after this line

630
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
And after the company obviously

631
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Start to gain traction

632
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
When did you guys decide

633
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
You know like we better

634
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Checkered racing money

635
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
And we went

636
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
And try to get Dad

637
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
Cuz we figured I'd fly give up equity

638
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
If we could just get some loans to help us

639
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Find the cemetery that we needed

640
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
We went to 18 different banks

641
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
And only one

642
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Would talk to us

643
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
And again this was

644
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,616
2010 so soon after

645
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
The financial crisis

646
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
And what all these going officer said is

647
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,320
Hey we've never seen such a beautiful business plan we've never seen a company

648
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
That has such great early results

649
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
But

650
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,232
We can't give you a loan because you don't have two years of tax return

651
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
What did you guys do

652
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
We ended up getting

653
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Any $200,000 SBA loan

654
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
We had to sign

655
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Pride 400 document

656
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,544
Including one that said we weren't going to use the money to open a zoo

657
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,920
And we really try to think of other creative forums

658
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Financing a business

659
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
And so we working

660
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
With a third party will just

661
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Company that managed

662
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Summer inventory

663
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
And

664
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
Loved our brand our business in

665
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,768
He was asking what can he do to help Drive growth in our business so that they can have more business

666
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
I really constrained by

667
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
Our ability to purchase inventory at the

668
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Pyside Wild

669
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
You guys seem like you're really good at

670
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
PR

671
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
Our company need some help

672
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Lotr what if

673
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
You do some PR Consulting for us

674
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
And

675
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
We'll pay you a few hundred thousand dollars

676
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,440
So I guess you launched in 2010

677
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
Today you have closed

678
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
800 employees

679
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
You sold

680
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
I'm sure millions of pairs of glasses

681
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
How much do you think you are successful

682
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Was because of

683
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
You know you guys are

684
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Smartass

685
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Really hard workers or

686
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Or how much of it was it was like

687
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
To say that there's a lot of it

688
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Deliberate serendipity

689
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
For example we were really lucky

690
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
To be exposed

691
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
H2r marketing

692
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
Professor that helped us think through

693
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Pricing

694
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
We had created Goodwill by

695
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,000
Being friendly and doing well in his class and he was willing to dedicate time to us

696
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
So I think there's a million examples of that or

697
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Eyemart

698
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Friends

699
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Calling in favors on our behalf

700
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
Want to think that we were just straight-up lucky on his timing

701
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
Right timing is everything

702
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Paint coming off

703
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
The financial crisis

704
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
The public was

705
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,432
Looking for ways to save money and I think a brand like ours

706
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Even resonated

707
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Even more

708
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Last year I read that

709
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
That you guys raised like

710
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
A hundred million dollars

711
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Soap

712
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
What's what's a company valued at

713
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
At our last valuation was over billion dollars

714
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
When you when you hear that a billion dollars

715
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
That's crazy

716
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
It's pretty crazy

717
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Yeah you know

718
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
It's exciting but not nearly

719
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
As exciting as

720
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Psych coming to work

721
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Everyday and

722
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Being in an office

723
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
They said we'd actually designed ourselves

724
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,528
Seeing people in the subway wearing our glasses like that one

725
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,832
Never get old can you recognize your glasses

726
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Oh yeah

727
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
A10 fact

728
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
The first time

729
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
We saw the glasses in in the wild

730
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
I remember

731
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
Seamless prostatic what are my odds on the subway

732
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Fireman

733
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Union Square

734
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
And I just are following the person

735
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Handy David

736
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
If someone's following you on the platform like

737
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
You've got a dirty look but I just big like ear-to-ear smile

738
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:33,504
That's Neil Blumenthal Warby Parker

739
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,136
Neil and Dave gilboa co-founded Warby Parker with two other friends for business school generator and Andy

740
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,744
Company actually partnered with the nonprofit where Neil used to work fish in Spring

741
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
Bring eyeglasses to people around

742
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,864
The world don't have access to them

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
Our show is produced as Weak by Kacey Herman with music composed by run teen Arab Louis thanks also to leave a grandson has

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Mexican port at Jeff Rogers

749
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
Gyros and you're listening to how I built this

750
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
From NPR

751
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Hey thanks for sticking around

752
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Because we are now the very end of the show the part of the show where we

753
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
We hear about the things

754
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
You are building

755
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
This week the story of Two Sisters who are trying to

756
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
Change the way people

757
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
Sac hi my name is Melissa Lee I'm from Somerville Massachusetts and my sister Linda

758
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
Co-founders of Cruz facts

759
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Melissa and Linda are in

760
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,144
2 things you wouldn't necessarily think need to be fixed

761
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Skiing

762
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
And

763
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Trail mix

764
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Both seem like they're kind of

765
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,080
Great except when you put them together because then

766
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Then you have a problem

767
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
It's this trade-off of I'm really hungry

768
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
But I have to figure out how to get the

769
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
The snack

770
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
And not have my fingers go numb so you have to

771
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Yo take one glove off user

772
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
TV stand

773
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,952
Given that right fumbling to grab a glove full of

774
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Pretzels with M&Ms

775
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
In the pocket of your

776
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Winter coat

777
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
It doesn't work

778
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
So to solve this problem Melissa and her sister came up with 8

779
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
Trail mix that comes

780
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
In a tube with a hinged

781
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Lid attached to

782
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,616
We wanted it to be able to be open with one hand to be able to be open with a glove on

783
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
And

784
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
Sort of to be able to fit in your pocket

785
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
No matter how bulky your gloves

786
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
Just a flick of your thumb

787
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Open the tube YouTube

788
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Tip it back

789
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Chugs and dried fruits and nuts

790
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
Send

791
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
You hit the slopes

792
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
So I think spreading the idea that is

793
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
It's drinkable or that you would

794
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,560
Use it like you would use a water bottle

795
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,936
That's what I like people really start to understand the concept of wow this is like something different than just

796
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,496
My regular trail mix in a ziplock bag

797
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
It actually took

798
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Melissa and Linda

799
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
Several months to find the right

800
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Kind of tube

801
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Science labs

802
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
And eventually they landed on what they thought was the

803
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Perfect fit

804
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
Incubation tube for testing those on people they were like they was kind of like urine samples and I was like

805
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,488
I don't want a package it in something that reminds people of your and that's the last thing I want

806
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
So the two sisters

807
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Cat searching

808
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,584
Found the right match

809
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Which course

810
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:33,472
Crew socks are not being sold at a few ski resorts in New Hampshire and Vermont

811
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,544
Company is only 6 months old and it's not yet profitable

812
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
So for now

813
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Melissa and Linda are

814
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Keeping their part-time jobs as

815
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Guristas

816
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Somerville

817
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
But the best part for Melissa

818
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
She gets to work with her sister

819
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,088
I wouldn't be able to do this if I had to do it alone there's just so much

820
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,880
Doubt that goes into the process

821
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
And I think it was

822
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,488
Really really helpful to have someone by your side

823
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
And someone going through all the

824
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
The same ups and downs

825
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
Text Melissa Lee She co-founded

826
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Crew

827
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Snacks that

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
