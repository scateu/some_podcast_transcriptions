Well I'm happy to replace the vacuum

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
In a bag with a psychic thing

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864

Britain's most successful

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Question

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
Who invented the light bulb

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
Thomas Edison right that is the name that usually comes to mind

22
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
Because Edison Diaz

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Probably the most

24
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Famous American inventors

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
History

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
He held the record for

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
The most

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
By a single person

29
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Actually invent the light bulb

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
Took the existing design for a light bulb

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
What time the best light bulb would only work for a few hours

32
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
And Edison improved it he made a much

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Much better life

34
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
That's basically what James Dyson

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
Dad with the vacuum cleaner

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
A product that had been around for almost

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
80 years any product

38
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
So Associates

39
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
Betting match

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
The English-speaking world

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
They're still called Hoover's

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
So as you hear James Dyson much like Thomas Edison

44
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
Used a kind of trial and error design process

45
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
For that back

46
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
Prototype in a shed in his backyard

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Tinkering

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Making small changes

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
And then testing them

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
In fact he made over 5

51
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
Thousand Turtle types

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Before perfect

53
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,320
Theisen's Journey as an inventor started a long time before he

54
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Created his now famous vacuum

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
England

56
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Right after the second World War

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Moses brother and sister

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
His dad was a Classics teacher at a boarding school but

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
When James was about 9 years old

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Is that

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Died of cancer

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
My mother

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,752
Sword coming news happening we we didn't

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,848
It was more of a surprise to us

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
It was too high

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
She carried on

67
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
When trained as a teacher

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Teaching

69
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
The school which is a school year

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Page goat

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
The one where your dad

72
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,952
Boarding school

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
United States Navy health insurance

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Being a little time

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
The school said where you can come as borders

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
App for free

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
We had a free education

78
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Emigrate

79
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Money and comfort

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Kapoor family

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Had a good education

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
She got to deliver this boarding school

83
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Which is

84
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Probably pretty harp music

85
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
As a kid

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
I want your dad

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
What do you remember about

88
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,488
I might have one thing that was it was quite difficult for me because I was at school in my father tortoise

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
There was a memorial service for him

90
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Which of course the health school head coach

91
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
Pretend I didn't see the boys but if you want to

92
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
Set match lot to me but no NovoLog to the boys around me

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
And indeed I think getting away to boarding school

94
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Just off to hit died from

95
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
I should have stayed at home

96
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
My brother and sister

97
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm a mother

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
That was probably a pretty harsh thing to do to a nine-year-old

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
But this site are in England. Do not sending people away to boarding school toughen him up

100
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,536
Probably does.

101
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,399
So I had to remind myself and not anybody else

102
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Determined

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,799
Very very determined to prove something

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
James wasn't quite sure how he would eventually prove himself and after you finish school

105
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
He managed to get a spot at the Royal College of Art

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
In London

107
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,159
And he decided to study Furniture Design and then architecture and Structural Engineering

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Innisbrook job

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
College was for Fairly prominent British engineer and inventor named Jeremy fry

110
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
SF channel of an engineering company

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Tok just got married

112
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
And he says well I'll give you a design Joel 2

113
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,663
And what was it about you that interested him and why would he offer

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,039
You a job light employing young people

115
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
What Bryson Pebble the right

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Attitudes and ideas so he gave

117
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Opportunity for young people

118
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
So I started designing one to two things

119
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
The sad thing I designed for him

120
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
What's this high-speed landing craft

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
This was a

122
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Moonlight

123
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Because his Maiden pissed

124
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Was making valve actuators

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Oil and gas pipeline

126
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
This was his iron in French

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
He had a side gig that was inventing

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Boats

129
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Well that just hit invented a boat

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
The theory was that

131
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Flat bottom boats

132
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Is the most efficient planing Hull

133
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
It's not very good in Heavy Seas

134
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
But because it's

135
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Flats

136
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
Flashes in twice Robert custard

137
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Movies when it's storming the beach of Normandy

138
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Yes except

139
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
But that is not flat person

140
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Oak that fish shaped house which is why you see the troops I mean to Wade through chest-high water in order to get to the beach

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
West we could land Straits on the

142
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Patrick and ran the bait shop.

143
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
So he had this idea to build

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,695
This landing craft or transport craft that and he said to you hate

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
I guess idea

146
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Can you

147
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
How to design something

148
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
That's exactly what you said

149
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
It was a simple as that

150
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
And it was as mad as that

151
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Because

152
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
I've never designed a boat and I'd ever designed anything in fiberglass

153
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
And Abraham

154
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
I'm pretty have this wonderful attitude

155
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
You think

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Think about doing something

157
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
You just do it

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
Any hated experts

159
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Did he teach you how to make

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
Things because

161
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
How how does that work

162
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,559
But yes he did I mean we were taught how to make things

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
The college

164
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,167
But one thing we went well but we have to make a prototype

165
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
He supposed to say well. I saw that Caldwell

166
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
He said book don't try so I just went off and did it

167
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Like you described a of a welding arc welding C'mon Man Welding courses

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
And save it for life

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
How to use engineering tools

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
By myself

171
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
So you have your prototype and and does fry say

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Let's try some

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Let's put this out on the market

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
A pretty much that

175
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
And I said I'd that I know nothing about selling

176
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
He says well

177
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
The time. Icculus you designed every square millimeter of it

178
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
Every nothing about you know everything about it Sagat and said it

179
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Who's buying it was

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,367
What was it designed for the military initially has construction used oil companies

181
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
As a diving platform

182
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
As a bridge building

183
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
High tide many many uses

184
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
I'm within a couple years we was telling a hundred or more yeah

185
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Very successful business

186
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Fry was it was a very fortuitous meeting early

187
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
In your life that

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
She was older than

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Oh yes yeah yeah

190
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
20 years old

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Father

192
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
Probably

193
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Mental

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Told me everything I know

195
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
So I guess you worked with with Jeremy fry for a couple years and then at a certain point

196
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
You decide you don't want to come and see if I can start my own business

197
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Yeah but for 5

198
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
What's happened yes

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Anole

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
And he offered

201
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Put the fun man I said that

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
I'm still mine

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
Sairento designed and made the bull barrel

204
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Wheelbarrow

205
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
The pool inside of a wheel

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
New kind of wheelbarrow

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
What cuz I was fixing up the house

208
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
And I noticed

209
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,111
The deficiencies of metal wheel virus with narrow Wheels

210
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
This will advance table is binary legs

211
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
The Lexington

212
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Agisoft ground wheel sinking

213
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Soft ground

214
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
So as I used one

215
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
I sought it to redesign

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
And it was quite a good project

217
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
To do

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
As my first business

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
Because it was relatively simple

220
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
At least I thought it was

221
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
What was it what was

222
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Well it had this big

223
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Balloon Bowl

224
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
It was actually a plastic football

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
This 360-degree rotating ball

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
And it was more stable

227
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
And it was most stable it didn't sink into breaking ground

228
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,287
In your garden that didn't damage your lawn and it cuz it didn't sink on the building site

229
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Why are wheelbarrows like that today

230
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
The difficult thing that's been sending it

231
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Because

232
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
The traditional

233
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
Hardware stores is I wear then and a few garden centers

234
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
They didn't want to sell it

235
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Very strange

236
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,535
So I used to sell it to Little Adventures Benson the newspaper

237
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
There's always next incontinence pencil the bulnes kiss

238
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
That would be the sad part 4

239
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Four-wheel Paris train

240
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Molten looking at you nicely to sign

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
I think real better

242
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,383
And I started to get quite a lot of business people sent checks see how this company the ballbarrow

243
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,991
And seems like it's going pretty well so well that never made mother

244
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
What happened

245
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
Does Name ID wheel bearings

246
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Not many people buy wheel bearings

247
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Types of very small Market

248
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
I will receive a cheat

249
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,095
No wheelbarrow manufacturer as a Salesman or a designer or an engineer

250
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
They just make the same thing they made

251
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
You're off to ya

252
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
I may have to explain why it's different the best

253
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
Yeah that was so fun I mean

254
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
50 Cent

255
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,383
But never made me money so I should have charged a lot more

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
My understanding is that you actually went when you took in investors

257
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
You kind of

258
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Gave the patent over to the company is that right

259
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
I signed the passenger's a company

260
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
Which was possibly mistake

261
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah

262
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Why'd you do that

263
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Well it's quite normal to sign the passenger

264
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
What's a company

265
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
I thought you were

266
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
As I do not with

267
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
With all my

268
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Then you put wall studs

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Feather dress

270
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Just came in

271
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
And

272
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
The thing was I didn't really own anything

273
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
In the company of puff My Shaz

274
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
And I-90 and about 30% of the business

275
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
That must have been pretty frustrating me here's your your idea comes out of your brain and you don't even own

276
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
On your own idea

277
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
No but

278
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Sometimes one needs to go through

279
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
These Rites of Passage

280
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
To understand the importance of

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
The importance of a name

282
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,655
Having a majority share in your in company or even olish

283
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Not charging enough for the product

284
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
Running a business doesn't make money

285
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
All these lessons of a very important lessons to learn

286
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
And feel viscerally

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
And I guess it was around the time when you are

288
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
I'm wanting to

289
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Make new products right so what

290
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
What were you thinking

291
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Well I've had the idea for the back

292
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
Is Carlos Beltran

293
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Keep it very short

294
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
The frames for the wheelbarrow today

295
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Instead of

296
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Painting on wood

297
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Wetpaint

298
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
That we had elected to use that thing called epoxy casing

299
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
But the way you get the epoxy on

300
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
The frames is the spray the powder

301
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Electrostatic

302
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
I will back frame is REI open

303
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
It's a lot of the sprays going to miss the frame

304
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
And have to be sucked away

305
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Well then have it go well

306
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Play the factory

307
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
That you have a vagina

308
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Vacuum cleaner

309
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
The back of a spray booth

310
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Sucking away

311
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Play Palace missed the frame

312
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Michael is very inefficient

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
This kind of people who made this equipment

314
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Smart people use

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
And I love that use John site claims

316
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
I've seen John cycling console Mills

317
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
For collecting

318
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Find soda

319
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
So I went to call Pit one

320
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,783
But I saw an Electra Glide climbed over the wall at night and took some sublimation

321
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Examined

322
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,927
I mean came back and gave it two weekends we made one that was about 34 High

323
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
How does a cyclone actually work

324
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
Cycling is littering outside on my butthole

325
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
You have to

326
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Blow into the system or suck out of the cyst

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
But this is exactly why

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
I meant that

329
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Spins around

330
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Boy look

331
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
And the address I was sensitive

332
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,247
Military discount gets into the center cuz it's too busy spinning around the walls of a buffer

333
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
By centrifugal force

334
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
That's the basic principle of

335
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,463
In cycling for widely used in the industrial vacuum machines that were cleaning factories

336
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
It was widely used cement factories paint factors also two places that had nasty dust

337
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,935
That had to be sucked away by the central spec

338
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Vim system

339
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
Assume that this is a very good example

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
But you see all the doctor

341
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
Sucking away from all the souls and everything

342
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Socks at 2

343
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
On top of the roof by the EU say sike

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Huge metal psycho

345
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
And how do you connect that to a vacuum

346
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Well

347
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,903
Over the two weekends while I'm welding out this Thursday

348
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Buford Highway

349
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
I realize

350
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
What's the point of this site

351
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,303
Which is that it collects dust all the time

352
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Without ever blocking On Truckin

353
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
So when I saw house like fish

354
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
Like what I wanted

355
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
If you can make a small one and put it in a vacuum cleaner

356
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
So when I finish the welding I rushed home

357
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
I made a miniature Chihuahua

358
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Call Bolton's

359
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Scotch tape

360
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
I have connected it with a piece of hose

361
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
To my Hoover

362
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
And push it around the house

363
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
Listen Ram 1978-79

364
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
What just explain to me what was the problem with a regular vacuum cleaner in a bag

365
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,543
Are you frustrated by then did you hate vacuuming like what

366
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Problem with vacuum cleaners that needs to be solved

367
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Well I I

368
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Just put my

369
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Alright Heyman

370

Anthem

371
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
We had a vacuum cleaner

372
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Dodge bolt what was

373
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Bills

00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Custom bass popper

375
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
In the wild

376
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Apus solo spaceship show

377
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
About to 1st and diamond

378
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
For the huge motor

379
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Straight Talk

380
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Anthem

381
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
I was using it one weekend

382
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Professor

383
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
Sergeant

384
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
I couldn't find anything

385
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
So I took the bag out

386
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Under the end

387
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Contiprocontact salt into the

388
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Garbage can

389
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
And put it back in the back

390
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
And I thought

391
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
Is it right to buy bags again

392
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
I just don't understand

393
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
I don't know that's a suction

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
Exact kids before I went to the bag it wasn't a full bag is completely empty

395
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
But I still have no suction

396
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
So I got in the car and went down.

397
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Buy some new bag

398
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Okay back I'm putting it and you back in

399
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
And I got good suction

400
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
So I thought to myself what's the difference between

401
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
The one I've ever

402
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
On the one I just bought

403
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
And I have to look

404
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Lackawanna temperature

405
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
And you can see

406
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
It with my own eyes.

407
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Poison

408
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
What blocked

409
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
So I suddenly realized

410
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
What's going on here

411
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
You don't replace the bags

412
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Full

413
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
You replace the bags

414
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Because that blog

415
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Yeah

416
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
And I thought as a solution to

417
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
So at that time.

418
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,079
House for sale because you're still involved in that in the ballbarrow company which

419
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Chad

420
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Hey I got this this vacuum cleaner idea to look at what I suggested

421
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,647
Because vacuum cleaners bagless vacuum cleaner

422
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,023
They they didn't what they said was David so stupid if there was a passive vacuum cleaner Hoover Electrolux

423
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Will someone else would have made it is a huge company

424
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
Play possibly compete with you Jai and vacuum companies

425
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
I thought

426
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Say that these pictures

427
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Improve the technology

428
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,551
Quite happy selling bags

429
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
I may be tiny and have no money and bad debts but

430
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:40,351
No idea my suggesting that we make a vacuum cleaner

431
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Actually because I was unable to start I went back to my friend Jeremy fry

432
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
What is excellent

433
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
How far is 51%

434
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
How much did you tomorrow

435
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Well it was about

436
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
40 of 50000

437
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,327
To get to start it did not have any of your

438
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
3 kids

439
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
So I started

440
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Making price of Tide

441
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
X4

442
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
A site plan

443
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Where did you do

444
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
In the shed behind my house

445
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
So you did this in your backyard

446
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
Yes and you borrow the money or the money

447
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Lydia was Italy

448
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
You're so not all like start selling Lisa

449
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Yes

450
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Well that what what I thought

451
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
We thought rather well so it would get it to work

452
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
And then with licenses

453
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Tell someone

454
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
C u r a

455
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,655
Trying to build this and you're doing this day and night day and night then

456
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Yes

457
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
Nice booty

458
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
I'm doing in the shed like was it like trailer trailer was it

459
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
Italian Perico cuz this is before the days

460
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Computer simulation

461
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
I was building one person type

462
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
The time making one change at a time

463
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
I knew what difference

464
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
What's that one change made

465
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
I'm so hype

466
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Progress

467
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
The ricotta number problems to solve

468
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
The first lie

469
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,775
About time state-of-the-art was the site claims but only good at separating.

470
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Songs about 20 microns

471
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Cuz I have to get it down to half of my car

472
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Cigarettes

473
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Popsicles

474
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
That was the first pope

475
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
And the second thing

476
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
What's that I found it

477
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Has

478
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Sunflower

479
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
What goes straight through the side

480
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
A note B collect

481
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
And I built 5127 privatized

482
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,887
Before I got it right

483
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
Iterating and doing this in your backyard

484
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,055
How are you earning a living how are you paying your bills how are you

485
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Providing for your family

486
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
Well the money that I borrow from the bank

487
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
And the money that

488
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Dairy-free protein

489
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
What's essentially pay my Saturday

490
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Plus a few costs

491
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
Black at the cost to a minimum

492
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
And once you got a prototype

493
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Up and running

494
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
Did you go around and try to pitch the vacuum company's executive at Target

495
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Vacuum cleaner companies and one or two other domestic plants come from and what do they say when I saw it

496
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Butts

497
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
Getting ready to do anything I didn't want change

498
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,687
I wanted to Adam said that she rather like selling paperbacks it's like a

499
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,551
Jeanette's

500
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,647
Essentially they were curious but didn't want a license

501
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
How bad did your financial situation get

502
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Echo pretty bad it's not nice

503
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
But at the one thing that my wife and I always said was that we both had skills

504
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
You could always teach off some attention did

505
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
Do something even cost lessons

506
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,271
And I could always send money making fun of something something like that we had practical

507
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,599
We could do it yes

508
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
They wanted to do but we had that back up

509
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
But with all of those companies

510
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Mississippi companies telling you

511
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Not really interested

512
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
Did you ever get nervous did you ever think about just packing it all in and then end and going getting a safe job as a design

513
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Liner for become

514
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
12 Nation

515
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Has the opposite effect on me

516
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
And I can see that they what time diamond

517
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
What is a good idea

518
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Without good reason

519
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
I think it's a really good reason

520
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
What about your friends and family work

521
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
James Beard

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
Saying that he thinks is going to be a big deal

523
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Obsessed mad

524
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
But the thing is never to take advice

525
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
It me is is amazing his even

526
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
Some of the most

527
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Successful entrepreneurs have been on the show

528
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
I had sleepless nights they were they have anxiety about

529
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
About whatever.

530
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
Well I did I didn't I did

531
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
But I have a soda basic belief

532
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
I think partly from

533
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
But success

534
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Of the bolt pattern

535
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672

Like a boat

539
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,632
Having having introduced two very strange looking very different.

540
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Technology

541
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
You can make a successful

542
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
If it genuinely works best

543
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
Coming up the story of how James Dyson's design for a new vacuum

544
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
No one wanted to manufacture

545
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Eventually became one of the best-selling vacuums

546
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
In the world

567
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
1985 companies to try and licenses

568
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
But none of them are interested

569
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
Return his phone calls but finally that year a small company called

570
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,600
Beck's decides to try making and selling Dyson's design

571
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:31,744
In Japan yes very small Japanese company that never made anything before in his life

572
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,888
To make it for them and they would send it

573
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
What does it look like

574
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Compared to what we think about Dyson

575
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Today

576
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
It looks much like

577
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Upright machines accept his pink

578
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,712
And it has a lot of exposed hoses bit like the pompidou building in Paris

579
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
So you can see exactly what the address of cool

580
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
Respect

581
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Quite similar to the

582
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
Aaliyah Prime machines we sold here

583
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
And how did the two out of the cell

584
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
I think considering it was $2,000 it did quite well and like today's dollars

585
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
It's a lot of Monday

586
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
It's a lot of money

587
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Weston peick

588
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,568
Japanese people

589
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
What is the licensing agreement with

590
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
What's a Japanese company

591
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Enough money

592
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
You pay off your debts

593
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Well

594
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes it's saved me from Bank

595
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
They put it that way

596
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
See you if you licensed it to this company and

597
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
They were kind of selling okay

598
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
What made you at a certain point

599
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
I should try and sell these myself

600
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Well

601
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Setting Sun

602
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
In Japan

603
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
That's a ridiculously high price

604
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
It didn't really satisfied

605
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
Because I wanted to sell the loss of a reasonable price

606
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
So I

607
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,640
Set Blackhawk me to go on like this licensing people

608
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
I want to make

609
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
But I can clean that I want to design that I can do

610
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
And I want to sell it in the way that I want to sell it

611
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
I decided to

612
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Borrow some money

613
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
I was not completely on my own eyeballs out

614
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Xiaomi find my

615
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
Mi Rancho.

616
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Trying to borrow money to start my own business

617
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
But I thought I caught a good track record

618
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Designed the new technology

619
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Lycosa successful licensee in Japan

620
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
And I thought that I told Bill to raise money

621
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
The problem with

622
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Adventure capitalist

623
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
Is that they all thought that because I was in engineering

624
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:34,624
I knew nothing about making him sending things and I could possibly make a success of it

625
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,744
Say they will tie me down

626
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,328
I'm actually trying to be grateful

627
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,400
I went to a clearing Bank Lloyds Bank

628
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,800
And by some miracle they agreed to lend me $600,000

629
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:57,920
But I also the bank manager off to us and he said well I sold it you would want a big lawsuit

630
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,528
I told that you had to termination there's a Little Caesars in America

631
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
With someone who copies

632
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:10,208
Oh so I buy this point somebody already copied your idea

633
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
Reminder to settle it very successful

634
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
Name something is this bank manager

635
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
He went home and asked his wife what you thought was that contain that didn't have bags

636
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
And she said wonderful

637
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Exactly what I want

638
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Determination

639
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
To win a lawsuit

640
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
I'm partly

641
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
That's his wife tonight bags in fact

642
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
And presumably you had to put some collateral damage

643
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Like your house the house exact

644
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
My wife

645
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
And I had to sign the house over

646
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
I'm getting nervous for you thinking about that

647
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
So off I went do I have

648
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
That's a very small amount of money

649
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
To build

650
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
The tooling

651
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
And it cost the whole of the six

652
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,336
1000 lb is the internet

653
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
Detection Moe's inject the plastic into the makeover

654
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Now one of the things about tuna

655
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
If you make any changes

656
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
That's where the tool making makes the least money

657
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
It's like a builder

658
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
Do you make changes to build a stockpiling on

659
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Lacoste

660
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
I said to

661
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,024
My brother engineer

662
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
This is it I'm going in my money so this is it

663
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Changes

664
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
We go out to dinner

665
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
And I put the tuning anoplasty

666
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Plastic

667
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
Are there any reusing hallstatt fact

668
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
Nitrous acid can I use the other half

669
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
To assemble the back

670
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
And I said yes

671
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
So I had to

672
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
In a few people that dig message template

673
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
And through f4g

674
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Myself

675
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Time we had

676
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
One salesperson and

677
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
1 money person

678
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,720
Plastics Company

679
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Made the pots and I paid them

680
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
At the end of 60 days

681
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
And so I have to go get some more.

682
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
How how did you sell who did you sell them

683
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
I'm too how did you know where to go

684
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Well when I went everywhere

685
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
In those days the web mail order

686
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Remember the Sears mail-order Charlotte

687
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,552
Well I wasn't splice a one or two people who had catalogs like that

688
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Because

689
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
I spent a day with Abaya

690
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,720
Who was so curious about this funny man who done this

691
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Yellow Taxi

692
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
I spent a David

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Anthem

694
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
The end of the day he said

695
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Why should I put

696
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
You're fat containing in my catalog

697
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
And take out the Hoover on Netflix

698
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,408
Anisotropic boarding

699
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,064
I just looked at a long time and then he said okay I'll give it a guy and he have to be the biggest

700
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,160
How much would you sell it for

701
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
199 lb

702
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
3 * what are the vacuum cleaners for sofas

703
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,168
Didn't any of these the catalog company say this is just too expensive is to

704
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936

Albany The Price Is concealed

707
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Because you paid on the trip

708
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
You paid the same amount per week

709
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Ice

710
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Baseball print

711
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,088
Why would somebody take a risk on something that was untested that they'd Naughton ever seen before through

713
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,208
Because it look different at his promise with no loss of suction

Identify bags

715
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
And everything goes into another

716
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Catalog

717
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Set my first

3045 Bond sales for today's Catholic people

719
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
And then I got into quite a famous joke

720
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Call John Lewis

721
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,456
Department stores looking to compete with a big electrical multiples

722
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
And say

723
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
They wanted something different

724
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
For which they could charge more money

725
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
But it quickly became my best friend

726
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
And this was

727
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
1990

728
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232

730
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
So how long

As my distribution started

736
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128

How did you do that Azure the money to do that

740
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Well I didn't

741
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
So I said to

I'll put all the profit on this Viking

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Listen to television

747
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
Which I did

748
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,912
I'm sorry my strapline the banding to say goodbye to the bag taken by the back

749
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
So I had this woman explained

The Dyson doesn't lose suction

751
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,568
Not this dude and then she said don't need these entwife a bag

752
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Initial wax

753
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
It's Naples from that

754
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
I guess within 2 years

755
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
This vacuum

756
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,928
By 1995 this becomes the number one selling vacuum cleaner in the UK

757
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Yes

758
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
Blown away over you for reasoning is yourself

759
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
You can't stop you just have to carry on

760
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:14,336
And then bring out of a new fashion of a kind of diversion

761
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
I'm even starting to export

762
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
How much were you making by the time you

763
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,296
For the number one best-selling back in the UK what was the annual revenue for Dyson

764
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
Turner's public hundred billion dollars

765
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
In 2 years

766
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
That's incredible

767
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Guess I'm in at 8 sub

768
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
It's a very steep draw

769
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
And that doesn't happen

770
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
It's happened to coordinate techworld I mean this is a real

771
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:45,312
This is a real thing that people can buy and take home

772
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
And

773
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
See people buying the vacuum

774
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Like

775
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Commenting on the

776
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
It was tremendous that that was actually much more exciting

777
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Tullahoma

778
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
And how did you get

779
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
Into the US market which is your by guess

780
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
Became your biggest Market in the world

781
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Yes

782
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
The first year we didn't do any of the

783
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
But even getting

784
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
In master

785
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Because

786
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
Everybody said I what you might have been successful in English

787
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
America

788
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
And then

789
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Juniper

790
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Best Buy

791
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
I took one off vacuum cleaners home

792
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Couple of weeks

793
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
And said to her boss

794
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Look

795
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Is what it says it is

796
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
It works really well

797
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
And it doesn't do suction

798
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Best Buy toolkit

799
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
And I'm

800
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
The first year we didn't do any effort

801
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Seoul

802
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Pretty well

803
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
It's like mm to mm

804
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
And then we

805
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
I started getting into bondage

806
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
So we decided to put all that money

807
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
I love you bestie

808
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
Into a television

809
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
And so it wasn't my suggestion

810
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
The summer set

811
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
But why didn't you do that

812
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Explain what you did and why you did it

813
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
Just like you on TV on TV

814
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Take it back

815
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
Container Park Shanghai talk bag

816
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
And then Chinese

817
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Am I psychic

818
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,184
And you know that Americans are suckers for a

819
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
British Acts

820
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
Well I didn't know that

821
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
How that compared to work

822
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
Why does the suction

823
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
And why mine doesn't

824
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Michelle sturgeon

825
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
My house

826
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
And it was a very successful

827
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
And that

828
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
We started selling very fast

829
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Good

830
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
As you grew and grew and grew and grew I mean eventually

831
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,624
Began to sort of expand out to

832
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
A whole range of products

833
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
Text mean

Bladeless fans

836
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,328
Anybody who's gone to a sports

Elsewhere has used Dyson hand dryer

839
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Put your hands in and out of

840
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,360
Begin to expand other products

841
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Well fast food

842
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
Define bladeless fan

843
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Bring that to me

844
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Yes yes

845
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
You accelerate the air out of an iris law

846
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
That draws another app

847
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Event

848
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Expand

849
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Volume

850
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
But I've had that you're creating

851
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Can you create

852
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Negative pressure suction

853
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Behind

854
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
So you pull it more

855
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
So you end up

856
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Multiplying the ridge

857
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Alaska flight 15 to 20 time

858
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Knox

859
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
But that's the basic principle

860
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
I am not sure I entirely understand it but it is amazing

861
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
To see that thing worth is he was who

862
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Blue

863
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Delete powerful

864
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
Yeah

865
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
That is interesting

866
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
And of course you have no plates to clean

867
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,632
I'm curious about your the way you run a business because you really are an inventor and designer

868
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,216
And you don't strike me as somebody who's interested in

869
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,800
Administering a company you're doing the books or

870
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,360
Going to a bunch of meetings or maybe you are are you

871
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
How do you do those all those thing

872
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
Well I have to do all those things

873
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
At the beginning

874
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
But

875
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,832
As the company grew I did more and more the engineering

876
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
And now I spend it a night

877
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,440
85% of my time doing that

878
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
But I was the CEO for

879
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
The first 10 years

880
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
Ronald totally happy

881
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,168
Doing anything other than engineering

882
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
Do I still resent the time I'm doing that

883
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
I would much rather be with my engine is

884
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,408
I think I really love doing I'm doing what I think is the most important thing

885
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Did you feel a sense of

886
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Secretly a sense of

887
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
Schadenfreude that you

888
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,672
Or right and the people at the ballbarrow company were wrong and those

889
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,512
Other vacuum companies were wrong when they turned you down to you secretly think

890
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
No no I'm on to the next thing I'm going to

891
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Everybody makes mistakes

892
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
Effective said what I do

893
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Wrong actually that crazy

894
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Mistakes great

895
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
How about charging enough for the bulb

896
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
Mistake mistake

897
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,200
I've never made the mistake of giving away equity

898
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,576
You own 100% of it you don't have to answer to shareholders

899
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
That's wonderful life

900
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Pretty simple

901
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
You are

902
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Two people understand that

903
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
Cuz you went from being deeply in debt

904
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
In your early 40s

905
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,424
Really having nothing no money and

906
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Weekend

907
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,032
2 today reminder - 2 today you own

908
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
Jet a private yacht

909
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
I mean that's

910
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,640
Crazy to think that

911
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
Not that long ago

912
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
In middle age

913
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
You are nothing

914
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
Yes yes it is

915
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
Annies anyway that it's

916
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
I find it quite nice

917
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
He came much later.

918
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
I think it would be very different

919
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Had to happen.

920
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
And you guys are so big wrists

921
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Huge

922
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Financial Risk

923
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
But I am able to do it and that's the Big Dipper

924
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,104
Hi I am able to take a long-term View

925
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
And invest large sums

926
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,432
Take big risks

927
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Huge privilege to be in the

928
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Position

929
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
How much of your success

930
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,952
Do you attribute to your scale your intelligence your hard work and how much of it to lock

931
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
Absolutely not my intelligence

932
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Hardware

933
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Yes

934
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Perseverance

935
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,376
Yes and luck

936
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Yes gif

937
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
I do believe

938
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
That you create your own blog

939
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Because

940
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Lucky Zara

941
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,872
Yeah I did long distance running a school

942
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
And you ain't E60 baidu

943
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Huge amount

944
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Training

945
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
And then

946
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Having great stamina

947
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Understanding that

948
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
Other people will say fitting Todd say

949
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
When you feel tired you should

950
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Accelerate

951
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
That's when you start weaning

952
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Yeah

953
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Waze

954
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Developing new technology

955
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
When you feel like giving up

956
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
Is precisely the point everybody else gets out

957
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,520
That point that you must put an extra effort

958
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Are you do that

959
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Success is literally just round

960
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
That's James Dyson actually Sir James Dyson he was nice

961
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:24,672
2006 Sir James will celebrate 50 years of marriage this year

962
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
The latest Forbes estimates put his net worth at 5.8 billion dollars

963
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
I like you still f****** your own house

964
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
But of course yourself you don't hire people to do it

965
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
I do some vacuuming

966
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
On my class

967
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
But I might like doing all those chores because I learned you know what works and what doesn't.

968
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,376
And stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you

969
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Things your build

970
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,984
The first of quick thanks to one of our sponsors

971
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
The new Surface Pro 4 Microsoft

972
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
With a fast processor and all day battery life

973
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
This powerful laptop

974
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Programs you need

975
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
When you're on the go

976
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
And it works with your iPhone

977
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
The new Surface Pro is the lightest

978
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
Powerful Surface Pro ever

979
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

980
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
Time now for how you built that

981
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,144
And we got a really nice product to talk about this week

982
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,544
Crime shows that detective walks into a murder scene and starts looking for clues in the blood

983
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
I'm just lying around

984
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,224
Real police have to be trained to do that and this kind of training has been going on for a long long

985
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,808
Time in forensic teams at police departments have used

986
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Everything

987
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Can make it realistic

988
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:04,256
Everything from Theron blood to animal blood sources to even corn syrup and water that classic

989
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
Fake blood movie you use to make your Halloween costume this is Teresa stotesbery she's a chemist

990
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
He says that if you're training a bunch of cops for like a day

991
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
You need blood that won't clot too fast that won't spread disease but it's still kind of acts like the real thing

992
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:25,760
And she learned all this when she worked at a crime lab in Ontario Canada

993
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
People were kind of

994
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
Grumbling in the friends of community that there were just wasn't a good enough

995
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
Fake blood product on the market

996
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Teresa Connell

997
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
By the way that idea

998
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,816
Around the same time this is about 2010-2011

999
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,376
She's working in another lab on something

1000
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Totally unrelated

1001
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
A better coating for steel

1002
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Tok keep it from corroding

1003
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
So I was working with this

1004
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,872
Clear colorless liquid that made a nice coating

1005
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
It could make little spots

1006
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
If you wanted to kind of spray it on things

1007
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
And I thought to myself hey

1008
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
This of course

1009
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
What's her light bulb

1010
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
I thought if you just put a little bit of

1011
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
Coloring in this and just you just Tinker a little bit with its properties I bet you I can make a pretty good fake blood out of this

1012
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
Until that's what Teresa did

1013
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,959
In fact at the time she was in grad school and kind of different thesis

1014
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
I'm fake blood I spent

1015
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,335
Four years perfecting the materials

1016
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,687
Got my PhD and then we decided to form a company where we would sell it

1017
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:32,575
And she's not working with colleagues at Trent University in Ontario to sell it to police trainers around the world

1018
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
The ingredients by the way are top secret

1019
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Are some water some

1020
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
Polymers and coloring

1021
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,583
The mixture has features that you find in real blood they call those little features

1022
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,399
Tails or spines are scallops

1023
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,799
And they can tell you a lot about how the blood got there so was it flying through the air was it

1024
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
Just formed on a surface is a little creepy but that's the point right if you're learning to investigate a crime

1025
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
Anyway Teresa's company impact scientific has made about $10,000 since it launched last

1026
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:11,999
And one of the coolest perks of the job I do make a pretty mean Halloween costume

1027
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:17,631
One year was I dress up like a zombie which was pretty

1028
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Intense

1029
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:25,311
