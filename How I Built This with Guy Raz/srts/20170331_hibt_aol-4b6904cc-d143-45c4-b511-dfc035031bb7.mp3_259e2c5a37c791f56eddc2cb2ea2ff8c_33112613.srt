Unravelled biggest contract

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
We work we are banking on that would just raise a bunch of money about 5 million dollars which for us with a lot of money so when Apple pay

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Basically said they wanted to pull the plug pulled the rug out from under arrest that was a scary time

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,424
Time do you think the company was going to collapse

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
It was really possible

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:49,920
From NPR how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealists

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
And the stories behind the movements they go

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm guy Raz and email and the internet

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,096
A normal part of American life and went on to forge the biggest corporate merger

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
In US history

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
If you happen to be over the age of say

20
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
35

21
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
There is a good chance

22
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
First time you ever use email

23
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
What is on a computer with an AOL account

24
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
Because in the 1990s

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
It will make sure of that by mailing

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,464
Free CD-ROMs almost every household in the US

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
You pop it into your computer and within minutes you could magically type a message to someone else who had something called

28
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Email account

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
And I promise you if you do not know what I'm talking about

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
It was magical it was a miracle

31
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
In this revolution in human communication was

32
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,176
Pushed by companies that are mostly forgotten that

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,528
CompuServe Prodigy EarthLink Delphi and of course

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
AOL

35
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
And out of all of them

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
AOL prevailed

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
In part because the company was smart

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
And in part as you will hear

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
It was like

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,864
Steve case was as Relentless as he was ambitious

41
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
In the way he did it

42
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Well

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Like many entrepreneurs

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
Steve what the Corporal route out of college

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
And in the early 1980s

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
He landed a job doing product development

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
For Pizza Hut

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
But at night

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
He would

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Anchor with his computer

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
We went to the process of

52
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Trying to plug it into

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
Alamodome and the others back.

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
It seems silly now but the

55
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
Not many people had PCS and that ass was right people at

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
PCS didn't have the ability

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Connector piece

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
To go to the

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Peripheral section

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Store to buy some

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
They call the modem

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
I forgot to plug that in on the phone

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Receiver on it right this way Farm receiver and then youku

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
Black girl hairline

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
It was you to set of a peripheral non-essential part of computer

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
And that was most

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Interesting to me so what I'd

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Computer I didn't eat

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
They wanted to get it

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
I could find that very frustrating process

71
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
It was kind of expensive to get online but $10 an hour

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
There wasn't much

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
Content online

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
People online

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,792
It was really early days but still there's something about that

76
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
I found Magic

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
It was that the fact that you could be anywhere

78
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
I happen to be at a time in Wichita Kansas

79
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800
And you're connected people and ideas all over the world

80
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
And that is

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
You could just take the leap of faith that someday everybody

82
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
B connected

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Be part of

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Everyday life

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
Then I really believe that would be

86
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
Transformative

87
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Indeed have the

88
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
The potential be as transformative as

89
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Things like that

90
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
The telephone

91
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Connecting on this

92
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Rudimentary modem

93
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
You thought this is going to be transformative

94
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
I didn't know whether I'd be part of it and know how to get into it

95
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Flowers near the idea of the intern

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
So what point will

97
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Are you able to leave Pizza Hut and then

98
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Don't completely different career path

99
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
Well when I was at P&G and then at peace I was still feeling a lot of 10

100
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
What was happening

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,696
Try to learn more about what's happening started looking something business on the side Consulting with technology company

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Nice trying to

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
The learn from it and my brother was an investment banker in San Francisco

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
One day

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,399
Send me a business plan of a company that they were thinking of invest

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,519
And their Venture Capital just like what do you think

107
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
And so they did decide to

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
And that's why I ended up starting a consult with that company

109
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Move to DC to join them

110
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
The summer of 1983

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
How do you spell control video Corporation I had a product called game live

112
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
To the timer

113
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Lights for video

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,791
Back that most people don't have PCS a lot of people had Atari game machine

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
Sprite and Sergey Moana login

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
Turn your game machine into a

117
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
Interactive terminal that the download games in overtime iPod

118
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Odoo email

119
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,799
Other things to that terminal

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
A market

121
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,919
There was a tiny market and it actually turned out to be an idea that will I thought made

122
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Samsung Market

123
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Agree weather

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,063
Are they launch the product in the fall of 1983

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
They said we failed

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
And his company was in free fall

127
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
This is my first

128
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
Experience on the alsea months after I was there as kind of on teetering on Banker

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
The layoff 7080

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
80% of a

131
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Employees and so

132
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
It's only became a struct

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
So what happened to your job

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Well if they kept me

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
I'm parked because I got a seven or eight people in the marketing department and I think I was the only one who survived and part it was because I was paid

136
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
At least I think I met

137
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Anti work

138
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
The Madonna Inn

139
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Trying to figure out some way to

140
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Reposition it.

141
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Some Partnerships

142
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
But eventually we decided to start over again

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
And two other people that were there the time

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Jim kimsey young Mark Sarah

145
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
When I ended up in 1985

146
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Starting essentially what became America online

147
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
At the time

148
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Inabilities if you wanted to get online

149
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
What were your apps

150
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,495
Basically had to buy PC I didn't figure out a way to buy an integrative

151
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Then call them out on me then

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
Subscribe to weather National onlineservices who were the big players

153
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
Big boy we started work CompuServe

154
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
The Source but then neither were

155
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Protectli baguette

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
The time

157
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
There was some other Adventures that were coming in

158
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
Into fruition there's one of typical Prodigy that IBM and Sears

159
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Royal CBS

160
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Committed by billion dollars to lunch

161
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Prodigy

162
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Some people were piloting things trying things

163
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
But about 3% of

164
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
America was online

165
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
An average of 1 hour a week

166
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
The markets

167
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
How did you even

168
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Go get the money

169
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
For this new Venture because I mean

170
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Kiss you are right you and your partners

171
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Failed

172
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,759
Will you your last business fail so how did you even find new investor

173
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
It was a struggle and in some of the investors from the previous company we're going to invest in a new company over in some Warren and we also

174
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Sorry about the tracks

175
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
$1000000

176
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,119
Did you get a decent share of that

177
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Because it was there

178
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
Restart in some of the investors lost their money on

179
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
Previous company Scentsy Madison

180
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
It started with zero

181
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
And investors with a hunter

182
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
Percent that you have no choice

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
That's why I said we wanted to continue going wait we had this

184
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Ideal we wanted supper

185
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
For sale at the background

186
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
1985 is hard to raise

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Venture capital in ESO

188
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,159
But I'm the only path to essentially have a new start a fresh start

189
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
Was to agree to a deal word what investors

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
On the company on the entrepreneurial team overtime

191
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
Got to earn their way into a part of the cup

192
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
So let me know if that time

193
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
In 1985 did

194
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Did you just think yourself well you know

195
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
This internet thing is going to be so huge

196
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
I'll make money off of it doesn't really matter

197
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
How we structure

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
It's a mix I actually I did believe the

199
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Haven't seen the idea of the internet

200
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Computer companies

201
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Belt on the back of the

202
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
The internet

203
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
But I was driven as I think a lot of entrepreneurs are not just by the

204
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,255
Economic rewards side of but really the idea that you could

205
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Change the world

206
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
That's why I wanted to figure out some way to

207
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
Take this idea that I was so fascinated with an acre

208
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
Get more mainstream sorry Franklin matter less you know what I was paid which wasn't much how much stock I got

209
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Got that much

210
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
My grand scheme of things

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
I want to pursue this idea this

212
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
This passion is dream

213
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
And what were you going to do with your product

214
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
Realize that this was still the early days of person

215
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Computers but there were different manufacturers offering

216
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Different kinds of

217
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,743
Computers and we decide what side of trying to do it on our own why don't we create a sense of custom

218
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Private label

219
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Online services

220
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
With each of those company

221
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
So our deals with all these companies

222
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
The Commodore

223
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
Or apple or IBM which will create the service

224
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
You Market your bundle are software with your modems or

225
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
With your computers are

226
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Whatever you choose to do

227
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Animal simply show the Revenant

228
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
And so

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Regret something called

230
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Qlink for Commodore we create something

231
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
AC wiring for Radio Shack

232
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
I created something

233
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367
Call Promenade Friday and we pray something called apple and for Apple

234
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
If I bought like a Radio Shack computer

235
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
In 1984 it would come with it

236
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,887
It's like own Radio Shack online service but big your company was the one that was designing that service

237
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Crack

238
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
What could you do with it

239
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
I do a lot of things maybe basic the core was allow you to download software because

240
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
The time that was

241
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Nothing but he also could do things like

242
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Emailing

243
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Participate in message boards and

244
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
We created chat rooms otherwise we always believed that the

245
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
The killer app of the internet

246
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
SoundCloud be content

247
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Media companies some firewood e-commerce

248
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Piccoli the retail companies

249
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
How we thought content

250
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Commerce would be important but the

251
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Community

252
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,263
The most important so we always focused on people interacting with each other even to this day with social media Facebook and

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Twitter and Snapchat essentially that idea of

254
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Community

255
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Hair continues to carry forward

256
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
She mentioned that one of your customers

257
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
First was Applewood

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Cupcake companies well-established

259
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
So I mean

260
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
How did you even get them to partner with he was it was that easy

261
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,303
I know it's hard it was it was they were there skeptical and then they weren't quite sure what part of the company even to deal with

262
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
I ended up moving to

263
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
The San Francisco area

264
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
And every day for six months showed up with her off

265
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Talk to me I'd like the marketing people talk to the software people talk to the customer service

266
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Were the days were they said

267
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Can you please like

268
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Papa Gino's

269
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Just got to keep keep going

270
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
I want to get that deal and I figured somebody

271
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Somewhere in apple was

272
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
I just need to find a

273
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Steve Jobs was not there

274
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
Stop. He's been kicked out.

275
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Just before that

276
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
And so on

277
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
We work with different people

278
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Within the company but he was

279
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
He was not there doing that. Cuz if he was there I can't imagine he would have

280
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
You're probably right because he was

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
You're so careful about

282
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Controlling

283
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
It was a Friday

284
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
The first time Apple license their brand to another company

285
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
I don't need not long afterwards

286
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
In the first year of launching the Apple

287
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
Appalachian decided they didn't like the idea

288
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
I wish they had license

289
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
I'm sorry

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,887
We had a little bit of a standoff and So eventually had to rename the the service they

291
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
They paid us if you $9 to kind of go away quietly

292
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
Yeah that's when we hang out every name it's we called America online

293
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
So when that deal unravel them I'm assuming that was the biggest contract

294
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,223
Yeah we were we were we were banking on that we just raised a bunch of money about 5 million dollars worth

295
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
French fries with a lot of money

296
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
On the idea of

297
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Expanding this Apple deal so when Apple basically said they wanted to

298
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Pull the plug pull the rug out from under us

299
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
That was

300
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Say

301
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Scary time

302
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Do you think the company was going to collapse

303
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
It was certainly a possibility that

304
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
That is there a lot of our investors and

305
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Who believed that

306
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
It was going to be hard to recover from the

307
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
Slauson the idea of essentially

308
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Moving away from

309
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Partnering

310
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,919
Instead watch her own brand America online with their own new marketing

311
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
We was scary sounds like it was

312
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Probably also

313
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Pretty lonely time right because you were just

314
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Likely waiting for this thing to take off

315
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,951
Yeah I was lonely and maybe even go to Industry conference remember one in the

316
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
LPC forum

317
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,327

359

The internet as we know it did not yet exist

360
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
AOL was basically a service that lets

361
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
Subscribers logon use chat rooms in email but you couldn't visit websites that were outside of the AOL

00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,231

00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Become commercialized

372
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Obviously was a huge

373
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Franklin

374
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,599
And was that it was it was it was as well as buy them and convince PC manufacturers

375
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,695
How to build a standard part of a computer and not a peripheral

376
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
World Wide Web was also Young

377
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Greater than that

378
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
93 ish time frame

379
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,399
It's all these things really kind of came together they when we went public

380
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Tokyo public in 1992

381
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
The first internet come

382
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Go public

383
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
And we have less than 200000

384
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Been at it for 7

385
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
The first decade was slow and

386
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Hard and two steps forward one step

387
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Back

388
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
It's the second deck

389
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Yeah that way things really

390
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Kicked in and thankfully we did stick

391
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
But but you know it's early days

392
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,719
When you are still pretty young guy where you were you running the company

393
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
Overtime at a time when we started I was I think 25

394
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Like that I was kind of young kid

395
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
I went to the crazy marketing partnership ideas

396
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
But over time I got more responsibility to come you're more rolls

397
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
I think it was in 1991 I was

398
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Was named CEO of

399
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
The company

400
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Sadly

401
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
For me one

402
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
We decided 1992

403
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Publix

404
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
The board decided I was too young to be

405
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:57,439
I didn't want you to be the face of the company

406
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,047
But back down the idea of the internet was sort of foreign and there were not XXX

407
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
You're all the CEOs you taking companies public

408
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
How did you feel about being demoted

409
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Lost I was

410
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Website

411
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
I didn't think

412
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Was fair

413
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
But same time I care about the company in

414
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Decided to weather that storm and and I did understand it one level

415
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
Then play green with it but it understand those logic that in

416
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Institutional investors

417
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
We didn't understand what the internet was and didn't none

418
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Understand why whatever my mom too much

419
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,159
It was an even harder if it was some

420
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
I'm catching who was untested and have

421
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Significant

422
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
Experience when you did eventually

423
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Can formally leave the company

424
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
What what kind of leader were you what

425
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
What did you think you're

426
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Either your role was

427
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
I think it evolved

428
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
They aren't that became much more of a force in the mid-to-late 90s

429
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
That's just the

430
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Spokesman for a while but also for

431
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
For the internet

432
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Sorry even when I was cui

433
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Lisa Jacqueline just

434
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Office of the mayor of the

435
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
Community monthly letters to R

436
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
Members talking about what's happening and what are strategies I wanted them all to

437
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
I feel like they were part of this

438
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Efforts are really was for the

439
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Cheerleader

440
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Rallier

441
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Roll

442
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Even though 20 years ago

443
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
Give us a sense of what kind of environment you are pretty in

444
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
This is like the early 90s

445
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
How do you sell this idea

446
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
The customers how do you

447
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Describe what

448
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
The internet is

449
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:28,319
What was challenging but it went back to trying to figure out ways to partner so even though it wasn't PC manufacturers

450
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
We partner with the New York Times

451
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
Time Magazine into what to offer their Publications about their publication also since we have the credibility there now

452
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
Names associated with AOL you could get

453
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,887
Headlines and encyclopedia

454
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
We partner with

455
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
Lots of companies that provided some of the services

456
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Some of the

457
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Contact that would made it more interesting but also made it more credible

458
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
I think anybody who's over the age of like a 35

459
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
Probably remembers having an AOL account write like

460
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
Yule log on and you hear welcome

461
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
You got mail

462
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
How did that come about

463
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,719
The voices when we wear them in that early 90s were trying to figure out a way to make the internet more accessible

464
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Walmart or something

465
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
People can relate to

466
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
I put a friendly face on it

467
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,703
One way to make it seem more friendly more human was actually have a person welcoming into the service

468
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
And so I was talking about that one day with her

469
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Customer service department

470
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,151
A woman they are basically so what my husband does voice-over kind of think so

471
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Wake me up in

472
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Take some

473
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,039
Messages inside of me I got my old pen down a Post-It note and bunch

474
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Different things like

475
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
You've Got Mail on

476
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
And I guy Elwood Edwards

477
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Recorded them that night and

478
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Brought in the next day or two

479
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Cassette tape and it sounds pretty good let's stick it on the software

480
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
And then became one of the most recognizable

481
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Voices of

482
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
That generation

483
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Do you remember the moment when you realize

484
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
That this was going to be a

485
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
A huge like consumer

486
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
Matches for 3% of Americans

487
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
For most people

488
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
I was going to be huge

489
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Well let's be honest

490
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
The moment I thought that was

491
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
1980 when I first started focusing

492
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
In my heart of hearts believe that the

493
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
State where it became

494
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Clear that was actually happening I wasn't

495
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
Set up a crazy life dream

496
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,255
I agree year was 1996

497
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
And we move to unlimited pricing and we had

498
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,911
Problem or system extras down for 24 hours number to get login

499
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
And it was a national

500
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,567
New story led the network TV news was the lead article most newspapers

501
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,431
Tell me the factory down for 24 hours with a national crisis that's when I knew that

502
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
His idea of the internet had arrived it was frustrating because obviously

503
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
We're down a lot of people counting on us and we let them down

504
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Palazzo was just a

505
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
A sign that this

506
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
This really was

507
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Becoming real on this

508
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,095
No idea the internet was becoming part of everyday life in a gun from something

509
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,423
We got started 95 and nobody knew about or cared about

510
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
It's hardly something that people needed and couldn't live without

511
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
I guess once you really started

512
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Take off in the mid-90s

513
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
Microsoft says we want to get into this business

514
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
We want to have our own

515
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Portal to the end

516
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
Hillgate summons you to Seattle to meet with MN

517
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
And what makes makes an offer to buy you guys out

518
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
They basically said they decided to

519
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,487
Internet world is online world was now as 42

520
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Check priority for them they're going to

521
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
I take it very seriously they're planning to create their own service

522
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
They're planning to bundle it with

523
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Every copy Windows

524
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
But they respected what we are doing in it

525
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
If we had a

526
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,567
Willingness to sell a company to them then instead of building their own thing that they would

527
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
You'll be happy

528
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
UND prefer

529
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Kind of gone with us

530
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
And so

531
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Little scary because

532
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
Senor we knew the threat of Microsoft was pretty

533
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Yes there is some

534
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Some of our investors some of the board members that feel like

535
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
We should quit while we're ahead that maybe we can't

536
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Compete in this new era with Mike

537
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Microsoft

538
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Came down to a close

539
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
Both but eventually

540
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
The board decided not to sell the Microsoft

541
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
Microsoft didn't fact launch their own

542
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
Are you worried that they were going to crash

543
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Cuz I had a lot more money than that

544
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Take me to Power of

545
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Distribution

546
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
The fact essentially every

547
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Computer

548
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,039
Shipped with their Windows software and they were saying they're going to include in every copy of that

549
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
Access to their service for every computer

550
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,440
When you first turn it on when automatically your basically be going to micro

551
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Microsoft

552
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
How did you

553
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
How did you combat

554
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
I thought how did you fight against

555
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
What did you do

556
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,240
First of all we tried to Rally the team to really focus on what made us unique what made us different

557
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,336
And we actually the fact that we knew Microsoft was coming into the brownie mix

558
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Company and the partner is over

559
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Bad Company

560
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
Add to be much more ambitious

561
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Turn to what we were trying to do

562
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
So that means we can today.

563
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
Build a larger audience create more content

564
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Cancel that actually

565
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
Ended up pushing us to do better than we likely would have done without the

566
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Redis Microsoft

567
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Looming over

568
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
I know that's a relief

569
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Much different back then did you

570
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Cinco Gates

571
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
So just being

572
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,216
Super aggressive and mean

573
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,520
It was a personal for you

574
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm not sure if personal am I understood what the why they were doing what they're doing and

575
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
I think they understood why we were doing what we were

576
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
We're doing say it was

577
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Something that we wanted to Prevail we wanted to

578
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Yeah went in and I remember even one

579
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Cover story of

580
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Fortune Magazine

581
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
And in the mid

582
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Late 90s

583
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
Basically had no Bill Gates on the cover of the magazine

584
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Who's going to win the battle for the internet

585
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Crossy answer was none of the above

586
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Towards the end of the 90s

587
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
2 Chainz real

588
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Basically

589
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Time Warner

590
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Why did you do that

591
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
I mix

592
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
First of all from US Financial

593
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Standpoint

594
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
We had a pretty good run it was

595
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
What's the best

596
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Performing stock

597
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
Kodak getting together Peak 150 billion dollars so it really had been wrong with percentage of of the

598
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Percent

599
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
Of all internet traffic went through AOL

600
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,424
We were the leader of the pack of Italy the packing was called the narrow band world

601
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Dial up modem

602
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
We didn't have a clear path of broadband which was

603
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Is controlled by the cable companies

604
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
We tried to

605
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Figure out ways to get into that way was

606
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
Looking like a struggle you were looking ahead and you knew you were

607
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Going to run into

608
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Problems if you did nothing

609
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,832
We knew it would be more difficult to maintain a lead and

610
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Broadband world

611
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
So we need to figure out some way to do that one of things that was attractive to us about a merger with Time Warner particular it was they had

612
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
The largest cable network

613
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
And so

614
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,984
The fact that they had that Broadband footprint was really a key driver for as well so it was partly and financial we were

615
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
One from our company when we did the murder that was 5 billion of Revenue about 1 billion of prophets

616
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,200
Are the combined company at 40 billion of Revenue $10 and a profit

617
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
So from a financial diverse

618
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Okay standpoint make sense as well

619
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
As you know it

620
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
It's like a classic

621
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Case study

622
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Express

623
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
You were blamed for a lot of it you know this you read all the

624
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
If it didn't buy the ticket to you

625
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Sure sure

626
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,472
They always believe still believe the idea of the merger

627
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,288
Makes sense I think it really goes to execution

628
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Hickory Run PA

629
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
People and culture

630
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Yacht Rock

631
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
And I was very frustrated

632
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
The company wasn't able to

633
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
Achieve the kind of

634
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:25,344
Vision that I throw I thought was possible that you couldn't convince people of what you want to do or that

635
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:31,744
You just saw the world in different ways. It was the other Market itself from right after we did the merger

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Stock market generally you wanted to

637
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Decline internet sector wanted

638
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Kind of a free-fall so that was

639
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Unhelpful timing also is part of the

640
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
Marketing at the merger. I stepped aside as

641
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
COC

642
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
Didn't have Direct Control of any of this

643
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
AOL I was

644
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Forcing the board itself

645
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Summit was the

646
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
Fights within the company Time Warner historically that organizes

647
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
Water independent company so

648
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Party idea to merge

649
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
Restaurant in the marina great away but that really never

650
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,208
Never happen so is a mix of different factors but at the end of the day really was

651
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
It's about execution in turkey license

652
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
They really does come down to people

653
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
How do you take these ideas and make them real in Spanish

654
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
People in it

655
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
ATMs

656
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Were you just

657
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Miserable doing that job

658
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Did you just hate doing that

659
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,104
I went Miserables made it. Yeah I was frustrated

660
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
It was harder than

661
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
After

662
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Basically a decade of being

663
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
Leading the charge being on the field

664
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
It was hard to be a kind of

665
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Skybox Young

666
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Not really having that

667
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Day-to-day interaction

668
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
And obviously you got

669
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Strategic differences that I had with

670
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Others on the board and

671
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
When you left a Time Warner AOL

672
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
What did you think I mean

673
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
You were looking for something new to do did you know what you wanted

674
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,896
Not specifically but I knew I wanted to do something that was moron

675
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
I love the whole 20 year journey I had with AOL

676
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
But I realize that now.

677
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
The first 10 years even though it was harder and more frustrating and

678
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Scarier and then

679
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Lonelier

680
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
That part of it I really enjoyed

681
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
That's all that I wanted

682
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Go back to the garage

683
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Got roll my sleeves and

684
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
And focus on new things the same time I decided

685
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,864
Rapid start another company

686
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
I wanted to figure out a way to partner with

687
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Elementor invest in

688
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
Entrepreneurs in a variety different

689
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Sectors and that's really what I've been doing

690
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
For the past 15 years

691
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
What do you think is the most

692
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Important

693
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
Quality characteristics that you've

694
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,576
So you either have or you've developed over time

695
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
That's allowed you to

696
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
B success

697
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
I think it's a mix

698
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
Let's kill some of it is

699
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Go back to the idea that Vision side of it and

700
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,680
Being pretty good at seeing around corners pretty good at the pattern recognition getting a sense of what might be happening

701
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,008
Headache perseverance I think being willing to take a long-term view is

702
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Discuss the

703
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
Fable Journey was a

704
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
Decade in the making overnights

705
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Sensation and so recognizing the

706
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,272
Revolution sometimes happen in evolutionary ways you going to have to take a long-term View and in

707
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Indy study there

708
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
Find the other is a respect for the role of government

709
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
The Roller Palace

710
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,928
Have an appreciation

711
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Developed over the

712
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,024
Of that role probably because the internet wouldn't exist without the

713
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,632
How was the government 50 years ago that funded DARPA that created the internet it was a government

714
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,544
Judicial system that broke up the phone company and my bell what's on least competition and lowered prices in Telugu

715
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Communication with the government

716
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,408
And commercializing it with the Telecom xideis understanding

717
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,456
The role of policy

718
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
Trying to figure out ways to innovate

719
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
These are going to be

720
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
UTEP challenge

721
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Just to take on

722
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Are earlier

723
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
TV talk about

724
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
Like being a cheerleader

725
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:46,048
Write like how important do you think it is for the CEO or the door behind the company

726
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
To be the head cheerleader

727
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Did you think that

728
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Social or

729
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Or is it a little overrated

730
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
People have to believe in the mission

731
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Don't have to believe it's

732
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Set of a battle worth

733
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Worth fighting a mountain

734
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Worth climbing

735
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
The most entrepreneurial Journeys are

736
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Circuitous

737
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Send an email two steps forward one step back

738
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
I'm going to be sometime scary and so just

739
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Reminding people why this

740
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,672
And why it's important to not just focus on the vision but also the ex

741
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,768
Execution priorities and things like that I think that is part of the

742
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,632
Journey if you're really trying to change the world really trying to disrupt important aspects of Our Lives

743
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
Steve case founder of America online

744
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
2005 he moved on to found a venture capital company in Washington DC is called Revolution

745
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,760
During the Obama Administration Steve was a member of the president's Council on jobs

746
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,112
Competitiveness and that was the first time he met Barack Obama

747
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
Steve and President Obama actually went to the same high school together

748
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
In Hawaii

749
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,792
He was there at the same time but no I was a senior when he was

750
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
I did Joker before he made his run

751
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
The presidency

752
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
The best noun

753
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,520
Overshadowed

754
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,592
That was a goner.

About us

776
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Basic As It Gets

777
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
Walking around Providence

778
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Hi I just kept seeing sticks everywhere

779
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,896
Sticks like to see lying around in the grass

780
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,712
On the floor kids are playing with sticks

781
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
I love building a forest

782
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
The cat and all my other friends left building forts

783
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
Tell by the way this was all going through

784
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Christina's mind

785
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,696
About four years ago when she was at design school in Providence

786
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
And for her final project she was thinking

787
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Maybe I'll make a new toy

788
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
And that's when I realized I need to find a way to get kids outside today is kids away from the screen boys

789
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
From Battery toys

790
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
The outside of engage

791
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
What kid doesn't want to be pried away from her iPad

792
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
PlayStation 2

793
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Build a teepee made of sticks in the backyard

794
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,064
A challenge admittedly but Christina started tinkering with an idea

795
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
The help kids

796
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Connect sticks

797
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Into shape

798
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
And I started

799
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
Working with

800
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,536
Existing connectors and like rubber bands and zip ties

801
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
Understand how gay how do you tie a knot how do you secure something

802
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
Actually she designed these stretchy connectors made of silicone

803
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
She called them sticklets

804
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
They're almost like cookie cut out shapes

805
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
And they have two to four holes in the shapes

806
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
And all the hoes at various sizes and you can use them with little Twigs that you find or who

807
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:23,392
Huge branches that you find and you might be thinking why do I need silicone connectors to

808
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,488
Build a Ford I mean I could just use rope to tie sticks together right

809
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,304
What Christina says sticklets are alive

810
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,608
Easier to use especially the younger kid

811
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,448
They love that they're stretchy and so pliable

812
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
The ring people over and say look what I built

813
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,872
Like look this is the raccoons chimney and he's climbing up in this goes down we got out

814
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:49,504
Mystic anyways after Christina made a demo of her cichlids for that project at design school

815
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
People would ask her

816
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Where can I get them

817
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,392
So she started to sell them for real and eventually

818
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
To sell them in toy stores and then online

819
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
But some of our toughest customers

820
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
For the parents occasionally parents will contact me and be like we'll wait don't have like step-by-step instructions

821
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Like how do we do this I don't get it

822
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
This is the whole point of cichlids is that

823
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,592
Kids don't want instructions

824
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,152
Just want to figure out how to connect things on their own

825
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
But because parents are demanding it

826
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,296
She is now writing a manual on all of the stuff

827
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
You can make

828
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Lipstick

829
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
The challenges will how do we how do we show parents the value of what they're paying for how do we convince them that it's worth of my

830
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,328
Money because it's a higher-quality higher-end toys

831
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
A pack of 6

832
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,448
Sticklets by the way it goes for about $17 silicone TSA

833
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Expensive

834
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
But you can do some over and over and over again to find out more about Christina

835
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
Because Ikea and her company sticklets
