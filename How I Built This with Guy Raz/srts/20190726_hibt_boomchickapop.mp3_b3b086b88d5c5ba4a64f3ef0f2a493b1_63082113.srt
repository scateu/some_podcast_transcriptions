Dollars

71
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
So there's a piece of career advice

72
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
That I've always struggled

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Because

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Halo

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Any advice is to follow your passion

76
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Follow your passion and

77
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Everything will fall into place

78
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Accept reality

79
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Somewhat different than that scenario

80
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
For starters

81
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Everyone has an obvious passion

82
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
And then not all Passions

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
Easily translated into sustainable careers

84
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
But if you heard most of the Founder's on this show

85
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
You might conclude that

86
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
All of them pursue their passion

87
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Like James Dyson trying to

88
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
Build a better vacuum cleaner right well in fact they are all passionate about what they created but

89
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
For the most part the passion came after the product came into being in the case of Angie and

90
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Dan Bastian

91
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Neither Dan nor Angie ever had a particular love for popcorn

92
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
It wasn't their passion at least initially

93
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
The idea behind buying a kettle corn kit they needed a way to earn

94
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
Somebody to save for the kids college fund

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
Sting and selling kettle corn seems like a reasonable way to do it

96
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Dr.dan literally son Unidad for kettle corn equipment he convinced Angie that

97
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
They should go for it they could launch it out of their garage in Mankato Minnesota and then

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,440
Garnet Little League games are in parking lots and that was how Angie's kettle corn was born

99
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
It would be the beginning of a rolling right along our the freezing cold days

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Crushing debt and the stress on their marriage and finances but 16 years after that

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
That kennel kit arrived annie's Boom Chicka Pop

102
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Soul to a huge book

103
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Quarter of a billion dollars

104
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
It is like many of the stories in the show

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Seemingly improbable

106
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Do people with no business experience no

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,487
Connections no real passion for popcorn still managed to build an incredible company

108
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,327
A few weeks ago Dan and Angie told me how they did it

109
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
In front of a live audience

110
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Ordway Concert Hall

111
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191

You grew up

118
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
In Indiana you grew up

119
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Safari

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,471
Yep in a in a Mennonite Community can you

121
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
Tell us a little about your childhood and your upbringing

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Sure

123
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,247
Well my parents were very young they were 18 and 19 when they were married and 19 and 20

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
When I came along and they lived in a

125
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
Trailer in the back of my grandparents

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
Yard and on the farm

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
And my parents mad at Ben and I Heist

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
Anansa growing up you went to the Mennonite church and you are

129
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Really part of the night

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Community

131
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,775
Culturally religiously socially all men and interest for people who aren't familiar with

132
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
You know what's Mennonite culture what it what is that

133
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
Me and I will see modesty right and so like

134
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Did you

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
I don't watch TV and go to movies and do all those things as kid

136
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,023
Little risky

137
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
Little different upbringing

138
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,007
It was very sequestered it was very protected I was very loved and cared for and very soon

139
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Simple and I didn't know I was an oddball

140
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
28

141
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,991
Yeah so you grew up in Goshen Indiana

142
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Yes

143
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
10

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
You grew up in in Mankato right I mean that's where that's where you from

145
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,207
So I grabbed Mankato third of four boys

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
It was kind of

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Chaotic

148
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,583
Get X in a household I'd say fun in a good way heading

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
In loving parents

150
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Had an incredible experience growing up

151
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Fairy

152
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Competitive

153
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
All of us boys played Sports so

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Few heads were thrown through the wall

155
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
A picture of a

156
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
Nnn were you were I mean

157
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Tell me what about you

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
Evacuar school like where you can student in school

159
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
I love school

160
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719
Are you going to ask me that question

161
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Why did I love you

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
And

163
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Fed

164
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
I grew up in an environment it

165
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
Didn't necessarily encourage me to go to college

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
It wasn't until my

167
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
My aunt Christine in Colorado Springs

168
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
Said to me when I was 19 like why aren't you in college

169
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
I was the first time anybody in my family said

170
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
That they thought I had some potential or I believed them to think that I have some potential

171
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Tension of doing that

172
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
I don't know what I didn't know what you know I I just said oh my God should have you think I could go to college and she said of course

173
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
College

174
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
I took a

175
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Chemistry cup

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
Course that summer just to prove to myself that I could do it and I got to be so I was like okay I think I can do this

177
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,175
So I'm going to college

178
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Went to school come easy to you

179
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
I mean it was

180
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,463
I probably would have been diagnosed as ADHD back in the day

181
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
You know it's just hard hard for me

182
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Fortunately I add

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
You know my mom was really great about keeping me keeping your finger on me that kind of give me through school

184
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,335
And I had to really smart all the brothers that allowed me to get into a really great school st. John's University

185
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
And you when you went and I think you said history in college and and was your

186
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Finished

187
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
When you finish college was your

188
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Idea to become a t

189
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Teacher

190
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,535
Toward the end of my senior year I think I did a like a month-long a little internship in a classroom

191
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Install

192
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Just love

193
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
The kids are kind of realized it was my passion

194
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
And that was really good at

195
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
And I could

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Kind of manage the classroom how I wanted to rather than

197
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Being told you know this is how you need

198
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Dutee Chand I

199
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
I think it really connected

200
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
RNA in entirely separate Universe Angie you went off

201
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
To study nursing

202
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
And you end up

203
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
In

204
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
In Santa Fe right or in Gallup

205
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
And was that to begin your work as a

206
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
As a you are psychiatric nurse

207
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Yeah I was just saying I was working in Atlanta at Georgia Mental Health Institute and I was interested in transcultural health

208
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,055
And so I got a Traveling Nursing position

209
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,663
Which was in Gallup New Mexico and they have the contract for Indian Health

210
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
And with the Navajo tribe and the Zuni tribe

211
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
It's for their end

212
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Psychiatric

213
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Cairn

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,623
I was like I'm going there I want it I want it I want to see what this is like

215
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
You also Dan end up in Gallup

216
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
New Mexico

217
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Teaching

218
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
High School

219
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
I had a family a relative that was working at the hospital

220
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,239
In Gallup New Mexico and I ended up moving down to Gallup teach at the high school

221
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
I just so happened that

222
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Ang

223
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Was working at the same hospital where my uncle

224
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
So that's how we met

225
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
You met

226
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
Uncle I thought he introduced you or you just met at the hospital

227
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
We met and Rogers kitchen

228
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Uncle Roger's kiss you

229
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
My jaw was broken

230
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
I have broken my jaw

231
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
Hatch dinosaur

232
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
I don't know I don't I was not eating well not to add painted in the elevator and fell I'm if it's broken

233
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
My jaw wired shut and my friend Raymond who was the social worker at the hospital was a good friend of his

234
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
And he said let's go over in

235
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Hang out at Rogers

236
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
So we went over to Roger's house we hung out and my job was why are Chuck and Dan said immediately

237
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
You broke your jaw broke my jaw and College

238
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
When I was in college

239
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
I was playing baseball I got hit by line drive

240
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
And

241
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
So Angie

242
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,751
I can relate to it like when she walked when I walked into the kitchen her jaw was wired shut

243
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,847
And it's like I know what she's going through she's blinding food she's

244
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
Like doing all that but that was kind of our connect

245
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Java

246
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
There was a group of people that lived in Gallup

247
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Open hang out together

248
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
You know it

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Scallop is a

250
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,583
Very difficult place in a lot of people come in and work in the schools and hospitals and

251
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,423
There's a group of us that were there doing that and we would just go hang out and

252
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Do happy hour every Friday night

253
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
We kind of got

254
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
How to know each other that way

255
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
So start hanging out eventually you guys

256
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Apple

257
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
And

258
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
I think within like 2 years you got married right

259
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
New Mexico where we just kind of had all small wedding but had friends and family coming

260
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,327
Watch us get married a year later your daughter is born 95 you guys move to Santa Fe

261
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
Write for a brief period and then

262
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
You eventually moved to

263
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Florida

264
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
You're young couple and you got a child and

265
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:36,223
Tickets to Florida

266
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
We just kind of said hey you know maybe it's time to get

267
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
A little closer to grandma's and grandpa's your family

268
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
So you move there you start working for a clinic

269
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Eye clinic at Coastal Recovery

270
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Center which is a mental health clinic

271
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
And then what did you do

272
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
In Florida

273
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,007
So I stayed home with the kids tattoo

274
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Credible

275
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Time with them and I also

276
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
At the same time

277
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
Start the entrepreneurial process in which I started a

278
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Yeah what do you mean by that mean

279
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Cuz you're

280
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,879
You're the lead parent right you are at home and and Angie

281
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Working

282
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
I don't work at this golf course

283
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,351
How many inches mom would take care of Annika trip I just

284
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Slap bags in

285
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,471
Tarts and I was just

286
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Wish I was good at I guess it and I got free golf I started this golf business where I'd setup Turner

287
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
For corporations

288
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,575
I didn't get real far with it but I only have one or two turnips I think but it was it was just kind of a good experience of

289
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
And I had started

290
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Thinking about you. Can we do something together is there an opportunity to do something

291
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
You know once this was winding down in Florida at we realized this wasn't an so we had some other ideas flowing through her head

292
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,703
But you would basically kind of start to think about hey you know

293
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
What will a business be like

294
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
Look at it look like this like idea started

295
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Kind of

296
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Enter your mind

297
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
Yeah I got a lot going through my mind guy so I don't I don't know if I was really like Focus

298
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
Anything specifically other than

299
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
Don't mention I wanted to do something together we didn't really know what it was we're getting food at the time

300
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
Restaurant Co-op

301
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
Caffe type thing where we could do it together and we could

302
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Go after

303
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
I think both Dan and I have

304
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,263
I have this sort of restlessness about ourselves like we end

305
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
And like

306
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
When one Adventure doesn't work we're onto the next adventure

307
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
Like let's go back to Minnesota let's go to Minnesota

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
You wear your friend and you guys decide let's go to Mankato

309
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
You wanted to be near your family

310
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Yeah it's so excited

311
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,999
To move back to Mankato I got back into teaching cuz when we move back we were thinking of

312
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Like I said opening up a like a cafe

313
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Some type of

314
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Food

315
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Place in

316
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
We just realized it was going to be too expensive we were

317
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,031
Prepared for it so we got back into her careers I got back into teaching

318
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,335
And she got a job with the state hospital

319
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Alright so you're back in Mankato

320
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
And

321
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
What

322
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
What is the idea

323
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
For kettle corn even

324
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
How do I even happen

325
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Like you're going to your job you are a nurse

326
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
You working at the clinic right

327
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
And you're teaching

328
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Can I just tell you

329
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
What we were doing all of that right like

330
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
Successfully employed everything and yet we said oh

331
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,471
We don't have any savings like we got to figure out a way

332
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
To put some money away for our kids

333
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,383
Does college fund do we have to figure out how to create something here so that we have

334
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Money cuz we both just

335
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Absolutely valued education

336
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
I'd like a six-year-old enough for year old or three year old

337
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
Started yet everybody's already got a college

338
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Binding of

339
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
401 whatever that is 409a together

340
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
You're something else

341
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Yes

342
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
IJoy tide be teaching during the day

343
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
And then and I get home and Android going to work at 5

344
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Until like 1

345
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,967
So at night time when the kids were bad I'd go online looking for different businesses and

346
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
You just search search

347
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
And what what did you what did you come across

348
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
So icy

349
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Yeah like what were you type things in the Google like this is purely goo

350
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,375
Early Google you type in like

351
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,239
How can I make money from a side business

352
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,615
Or your search parameters oh I don't know I but I somehow it's just stumbled across

353
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
A

354
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
A site that said make thousands of dollars every weekend or day

355
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Poppin

356
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Which is like

357
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,951
A total scam

358
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Eureka

359
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
$10,000 into it we realized

360
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
This is a potential

361
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
You see you see this and you think

362
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Yeah what

363
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,919
This is cool like and what it what are the sites say like

364
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
It just it had popcorn

365
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,207
I just like I said

366
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
And I said she's at work and I said Ang this is something we could do on the side I'm a teacher

367
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,447
We could do this on the weekends during the Summers

368
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
You know we could pop with this

369
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,335
10000

370
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,479
I remember distinctly the phone call I'm in the middle of maybe a takedown

371
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,319
Or something like that medication for a patient that's

372
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,391
Severe Ana the phone call your husband's on the line

373
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,487
So I ran back to the nurse's station and he's on the other end in Isa

374
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Aunt

I don't even know what it was it was

378
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,383
I thought of it as popcorn I knew it was kind of like sweet and salty but

379
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
I don't know if I had ever taste yet but it looked

380
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
Like a cool side Adventure where we can make

381
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:35,135
Thousands hours every weekend

382
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695

00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Like what did you order

385
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,095
We call them and we bought it on a credit card like everyone else and

386
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
We bought it we we got a cattle

387
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
1/10

388
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
You know if you got a fair one of those out there kettles

389
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
And all the equipment a table

390
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
It probably

391
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Wasn't worth

392
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Theater 10000 but we it was already a prep package

393
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Deal that they shipped

394
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247

404
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775

00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
It's like I don't know how many

Rico down our alley our Ally was to

424
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
Too small so I pulled up on the

425
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
Street outside and we had to haul these

426
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
The alley

427
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Okay

428
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Like garage that

429
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
We were on the phone

00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
That first batch of 5 batches with

431
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
The couple who had sold

432
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Equipment

433
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Trying to figure out how this work

434
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,735
So it was just it was a little cat

435
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
And then after that we had it

436
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,367
And then we just like the recipe

437
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
It's basically a

438
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
A kit that you could

439
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Go and

00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487

Actually find a place

447
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
That would let us stop and sell

448
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
It so that they could infect us

449
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
So was the first place that agreed to let you set up a tat

00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807

Supermarket supermarket chain but they let you set it up in the parking lot

453
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
There in front of the front door and we decided to do it the night before Thanksgiving because we thought that the Trap

454
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680

Yeah

475
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Weird experience

476
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,072
I wouldn't get into this but there were a couple kind of crazy ideas that we had experienced mented with p

477
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Before

478
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,424
I like a network marketing gagan so my family was probably like

479
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Here they go again

480
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Here's another

481
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,336
What is a harebrained idea

482
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
You don't for us I think it was more about

483
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
You know we're trying to

484
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
China just spinning our Wheels

485
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
We could figure out what we wanted

486
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
What to do when this was a way to get sick

487
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
$10,000

488
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
I have to imagine investing that kind of money

489
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Then was

490
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Oh yeah, big deal

491
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
It's a big deal

492
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Well

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
0%

494
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
You got to pay it back

495
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,192
Another credit card to pay off that credit card

496
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
There's a lot of credit cards going around

497
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
At that time so you start selling popcorn first time

Selling is like amazing like

506
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
The difference in what

507
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
What you pay for

508
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976

512
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
$3 AR

513
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400

Whatever but

516
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
They said it's really good

517
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
SO3

518
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
She come home

519
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
What's the next step

520
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Let's do this again like it made itself

521
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
I don't know it sounds exhilarating a little bit now that we like

522
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
We're in this

523
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Like we're actually doing this

524
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Beaver still

525
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,256
Teaching you were still doing your what would you seize your students like on the weekends or would you see

526
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
Wake me up folks in the hospital yes

527
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
And they would look at me like

528
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
What are you doing

529
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,144
Yeah

530
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Right I would have liked

531
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
When I was in the clinic in the afternoon I saw patients I was a nurse practitioner writing prescriptions and making worth

532
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Frozen

533
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,480
And then I'd run home and I change into my kettle corn clothes and go to the

534
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,856
Go to the local baseball game or with Tanner whatever and we

535
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
Make kettle corn and sometimes

536
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,304
My clinic patients would be at the amateur baseball games and they would come up to the table and look confused

537
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,912
Yeah cuz you were just running a prescription now you're selling me cat far

538
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,056
Exactly in my message was you can always be more than one thing in life

539
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
You can

540
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
All right

541
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
TiVo license you got pants

542
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
You got a kettle

543
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
And what were you calling the company

544
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Kettle Corn Cafe

545
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
So 2002 you take the winter off

546
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,560
Cuz you can't really sell it outside Campbell pop in January

547
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Snow

548
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
Because there was a girls basketball tournament at minutes

549
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,216
Set a State University and they didn't have any concessions

550
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
And so we said here's our efforts

551
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,872
And you have to do it Outdoors right because the propane and we put the tent outside the garage

552
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,944
And it was snowing and we just put the sides up and we pop it out

553
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
Outside and delivered over to the

554
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
College

555
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
All right I think it was

556
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
That summer

557
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Of 2002

558
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Where you basically

559
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
Started to sell kettle corn at the Minnesota Vikings

560
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Training camp

561
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,352
Rights of what how did that happen did you just like go there and set up

562
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Should you ask them

563
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
I'm assuming if you could go and set up a

564
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
Detent or no you didn't

565
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,384
And when you ask what they say yeah you have to pay us

566
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Certain amount of money if you want to set up

567
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Anti-hero

568
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Yeah I mean

569
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
With the Vikings

570
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
Former College classmate of mine that was assistant

571
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Athletic director

572
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
The college at Minnesota State University

573
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
And he

574
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Open the door for us to set up our tent

575
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
At the training camp

576
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
And I think

577
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
There may have been a fear Commission on that but

578
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,824
We thought I mean that was a huge opportunity for us to make some extra money we got the deal on it

579
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
Go in there to see the players train

580
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
So you start

581
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
Selling popcorn there and I guess

582
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
One of you has this idea what

583
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Some

584
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Let's send the players a team

585
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Popcorn

586
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah right like let's leverage this opportunity

587
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Because

588
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Dan

589
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,560
Like most minnesotans are huge

590
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Minnesota Vikings fans

591
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Yeah but I didn't understand it yet

592
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Because I just moved here

593
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Yeah he was like

594
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Minnesota Vikings

595
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
Everything all about it and and

596
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
You know it was at the time of Randy Moss and Dante

597
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
Culpepper and you know that it's like

598
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
All that that era and and

599
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
He was like wouldn't it be fun if the player zetar

600
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,392
Let's figure it out let's figure out how to make a

601
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
Just made tons of bags of kettle corn just made a few phone calls

602
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
Just to see if we could give it to

603
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
To them

604
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
We waited and we waited over to call back

605
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
No we got a phone call back and they said so we

606
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,728
I hear that you have some kettle corn that you want to give

607
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
The players

608
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
We'll take it as long as it's free

609
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
So we're like

610
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Okay

611
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Don't give it to him for free

612
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
What's up we pop 220 bag since

613
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Send it over to them

614
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
And you didn't even know if

615
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
The Place Riverside

616
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Nebraska room in Sunrise

617
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
So they came to the sales marketing team came over and

618
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,304
More less offered as a contract on the spot

619
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Yeah I think the I think the sales

620
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
People to Viking saw it as an opportunity to bring in another

621
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,008
Company to another sponsor

622
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Cuz it wasn't like

623
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,408
Free to pop kettle corn for the Vikings there was a fee involved in

624
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,808
And we didn't really understand that until we got really excited and then all of a sudden

625
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,928
Hey we've a great opportunity for you can be the official kettle corn of Minnesota Vikings

626
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
But it's going to cost you a sponsorship

627
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
$8,000

628
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:23,936
It doesn't hurt to be the official

629
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Fake Bake set preferred

630
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,432
It cost more for the word official

631
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
What we said

632
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
We're going to be official

633
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
All right so you are

634
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
Starting to sell in front of this is like

I mean

645
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,824
Every Sunday we get up at like 5 a.m. pack the trailer and

646

And take our equipment up and we'd be up and ready to go by 9 a.m. they had a party on the Plaza

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,392
And there be a band it doesn't matter if it were there was a blizzard or if it was

650
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
10 degrees or 0 degrees

651
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
The party was still on

652
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
And we pop kettle corn

653
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840

00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Some oil and

659
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
So weird

660
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
So when you were probably making

661
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,976
Somebody or but not too much money a little bit of money or will you

662
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
Actually was it will you start to be able to save for this college fund

663
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Not really

664
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,424
It all went back in the business

665
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
We bought a trailer we bought more equipped

666
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
We bought

667
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
I don't know

668
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Heater

669
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
For the

670
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
And I don't

671
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Everything seemed to go back

672
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
So

673
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,808
What's the socratic turning point we start to get attention because I think within a year or so

674
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,392
A local supermarket chain in Minnesota approach uses

675
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Hey

676
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
You know did you guys want to sell your popcorn

677
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Kiridar stores

678
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Is that what happened

679
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
Oh yeah so we started

680
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,424
After a couple years of being this outdoor event company

681
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
We start realizing like this is not something we want to do

682
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
For the rest of our lives

683
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
It was any

684
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,152
It was an opportunity to reach people but

685
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
We thought you know is there another way to get

686
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
Are kettle corn into people

687
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,880
Leanne

688
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,744
We we started in 2003 two years into it I Quit teaching

689
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
And I started focusing on the business

690
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,888
Was skin tearing get to work

691
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Full-time support

692
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,728
In the family as well as helping in the business and

693
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
We met with the local grocery chain Lunds and Byerly's +

694
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
They said

695
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
More less

696
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
Get your act together and come back and talk

697
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,016
Skip nutritional panel get Packaging

698
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
In all twist ties don't work in grocery stores

699
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
Popcorn with twist ties for cellophane bags

700
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,024
So what did you do how did you

701
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Did you start what you just said

702
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Will get her act together and we'll use

703
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
You see us again

704
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
And

705
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
It took a six months we found a small kitchen

706
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,360
We bought some equipment we moved the operation indoors

707
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
And got that

708
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
That kitchen license

709
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,296
And we came back in six months and lunch and what is your packaging look like

710
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
At that point

711
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,416
It was like a clear solo bag with a label that we

712
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
That we would

713
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,816
Paste on taluk manually by hand

714
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
So you are still

715
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,216
You were stealing the bag so I trip in the engine I in

716
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
Whoever else we could find wood

717
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Do these labels

718
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
Every night he'd slap unleaded what was it called

719
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Well we called it an

720
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,504
Because somebody said you got a name your pop you got a name your product cuz it can't be kennel cough

721
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Cafe Rio

722
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
We didn't know what

723
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Popcorn with

724
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Call really

725
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,160
So we went to the grocery store when we looked online

726
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,280
And what we thought the time was in the grocery store it was Orville

727
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
It was Vic

728
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
It was

729
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Cracker Jack

730
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,448
Cocktail and Thomas Harry and David and I just

731
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
Turned it down and I said

732
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Where are the popcorn with

733
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
When we come back

734
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
How Angie's kettle corn eventually managed to get into Trader Joe's even though it almost

735
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Didn't and how it eventually spread just about

736

Your business is a lot like solving a puzzle

00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624

747
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160

781
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968

00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
Well we hired on a genie we're retired

787
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Third grade tea

00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072

00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,424
They were married they retire they just wanted to do something together

790
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,544
And they said we don't care what you pay us and so we said well we can pay you $8 an hour

791
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312

They were two demos for us in one store while we would be in another store and get over

00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
What time we're able to

00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Brookhaven more

796
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,464
And they said yes

797
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,584
Because they were kind people and they wanted to help. I mean at this point you know

798
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,216

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Guy I don't know

00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,176
I'm not sure I mean yeah we were probably going further and further in

801
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
To be honest

802
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:08,064
Pictures of a continual dragon

803
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Totally chaotic and

804
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Just

805
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Doing doing doing

806
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
I mean we used a lot of credit cards refund

807
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
All the money back

808
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
There was a time when

809
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
We had enough credit card. That

810
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
A family friend came and helped us

811
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Is accounting he looked at her books

812
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Just said you know

813
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Why don't I just

814
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
Give you a loan

815
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824

We can relieve your credit card debt can pay me back

817
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,712
But I don't want to see you going on

818
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Vacations in

819
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:42,112
Spending money at the golf club

820
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
What's the question right it's

821
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,184
You started this out

822
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Create college fund shirt

823
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
Orchids

824
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
And it sounds like for the first seven years

825
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
You just buried yourself further and further

826
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Into debt like

827
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:58,752
They were they were never going to go to college this plan right

828
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:04,128
Hey and the other thing is we had the misunderstanding that when you have your own business you

829
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
You don't you own your time

830
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Yeah

831
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
The opposite is true

832
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
The business owns

833
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Your time like we were like

834
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
How did we go so wrong

835
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:19,232
I'm here in that in the first five or six years were you thinking

836
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
I mean we're in debt

837
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
We're working

838
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
All the time

839
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
It was hard

840
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
I mean it was it was really

841
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
I mean

842
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
I think early on

843
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Urologist

844
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Just takes over your life

845
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
What did you guys fight

846
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
All the time

847
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
We did we

848
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
We fought a lot and maybe that helped.

849
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
We're not ones

850
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Fair words

851
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Each other

852
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
But I mean

853
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
How does you compartmentalize like

854
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
You're dealing with

855
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
Patients with serious mental issues

856
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
And then you're like I was one of those patients guy

857
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
And then you are pivoting to

858
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Kettle corn

859
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,408
Well okay at the end of the day

860
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
I mean even though all of that stresses there we're both

861
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Pretty tolerant of you

862
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Each other we

863
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
We were committed to

864
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Each other and

865
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Both of us

866
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Pretty kind

867
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
People

868
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
So we

869
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
We gave each other some latitude

870
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
In the hotel

871
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Situation and we just

872
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Yeah I think we both just said

873
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
Will be fine

874
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
Like we'll get through this will be fine

875
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
It was really hard to refocus

876
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
And to realize that

877
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
You know we got to keep moving

878
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Forward here because we're

879
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,456
You know knee deep into this

880
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
We have to find

881
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
A way to continue to

882
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
Not really understanding where it was going or what the outcome

883
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
Future outcome was going to be still

884
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
All right I think it was

885
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Around 2000

886
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
You had to

887
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Get a loan

888
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
To get a much

889
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
Speaker spacing

890
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
A million-dollar

891
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,912
And you went to a bunch of bags

892
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
And

893
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
What do they say where they

894
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Were they eager to lend you the money

895
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
No

896
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
They were not eager even though you had

897
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Clearly you

898
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
You had Revenue coming in and

899
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
If we had dad

900
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
We didn't really have any collateral

901
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
And I mean Looking Back Now I

902
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
I can kind of understand Banks

903
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Position at that

904
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
What time where we were

905
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,328
And it was just it was a long journey was really hard

906
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,400
The bank after bank and they just said what

907
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
Yeah and we had we had communication with some

908
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
Do you know a bride A banks in

909
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Somewhere more

910
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
Open to discussing another xan

911
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
It was just I think ultimately

912
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
We just

913
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Weren't strong enough

914
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,320
In a strong enough position for them to lend us a lot of money we need a lot of money

915
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,160
Money to bury bigger facility to ramp up production

916
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:01,536
Cuz we had just at this point decided to move into a big bigger facility a 25000 score

917
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Looking for you at that point

918
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,704
Probably at that time 2006-7 maybe 20 ish

919
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
Colorful timer mixture archives

920
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Yeah

921
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
You know eventually

922
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,944
I found a partner that worked with us in

923
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,344
A banking and Olympus the money

924
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
And what did you have to

925
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,488
What what kind of collateral did you have to buy me you said you'd no collateral so we'll probably receivables and

926
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
Personal guarantee

927
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Which was our home

928
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Yep future earnings

929
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,728
Everything but the minivan

930
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
Your kids are getting older and

931
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
You guys are

932
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,480
And your forties at this point and you know for a lot of people that's kind of a

933
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,088
The turning point to you start to think about okay in college and always seems an end

934
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Was any part of you nervous about that

935
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
I don't

936
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't think he had a hat when you make that decision like

937
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,816
If you start going down that path

938
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
You're going to crack

939
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Is the bottom line was

940
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
People loved our pride

941
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,080
We just had to figure out how to make it better more efficiently and how to get it in the Moorestown

942
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
What did Buddha mean

943
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
Play a little bit of frustration right

944
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
Because people prank cops music

945
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Angie's I love

946
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:30,368
Your mechanic or it's awesome you guys are crushing it or so it's so great

947
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
Anytime you're struggling financially

948
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,256
What time is it like when you when you don't have any

949
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,328
Real money to start out with an all you have is ambition and

950
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
And potential and skills

951
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
You count on those things

952
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
You know to make your way through you know and so we never really had any money and we did all kinds of them

953
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Amazing things in our lives you know so if this whole thing went South wedow a lot of people a lot of money but it wouldn't

954
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Stop us from

955
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Living our life

956
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Did you feel the same way Dan

957
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
Yeah

958
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
I'm pretty

959
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
I have a pretty high tolerance for

960
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
For risking

961
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Dad

962
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
I mean it was about

963
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,887
You know if we had money is put it back in let's girl girl girl growing

964
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
That wasn't the scariest

965
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
The scariest part

966
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Came

967
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
The next spring of 2000

968
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
This is Trader Joe's

969
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Best wine Trader Joe's

970
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,639
Yeah and stroke before so we had

971
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
We were just very process

972
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
What's Raiders and we ended up getting

973
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
How did you even get to Treasure

974
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,159
A lot of phone calls in a lot of product being sent

975
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
To the bar

976
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
It was

977
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,767
You know I think finally the buyer got sick of me

978
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
And like said

979
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
I finally got ahold of her she was in her office

980
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
Marcy was her name and she like

981
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Is that alright

982
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
What are you got here I've tried popcorn

983
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,567
Before. It's not going to work and I said

984
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,151
You haven't tried our seeing what's that line that all of us uses

985
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
That we have the best productivity

986
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,319
Anyways she she liked it she said already did you send it to go out there

987
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
We

988
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
She agreed

989
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
To bring a saint

990
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
What was the order that she

991
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
Cheaper than she put in an order for

992
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
425

993
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,815
What does that mean how many bags of popcorn is that

994
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
That was

995
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
What for $500,000 worth it was craziness and that would go all across the country and Trader Joe's

996
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
Xi'an in this is a one-time

997
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
Deal well

998
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,175
We didn't know she was going to try and we obviously had some problems

999
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
With some

1000
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Clumping

1001
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,271
That first order and she immediately called and said

1002
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Fix it

1003
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Kind of done

1004
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,951
But at the same time the scariest part was our line of credit for $150,000 to run out

1005
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,023
And we didn't have any money to pay you 4:30 or 6

1006
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
60 day wasn't going to be paid until later in June or July or something

1007
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
2008 to deliver it

1008
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Where to buy the supplies

1009
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,775
But I send them to have enough money to buy.

1010
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
Corn and salt

1011
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
Alton so that was

1012
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Terrifying

1013
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
It was like we were this close

1014
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
How much did you need

1015
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Well

1016
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
There was a credit card that

1017
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
Came through the mail

1018
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,087
Just another credit card

1019
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
And it said

1020
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Call for

1021
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
$100,000

1022
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
And I got on the phone one night and said

1023
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Can we

1024
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
Get this hundred thousand dollars wire to us and our credit was good

1025
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
And soli wireless $100,000

1026
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Act like a hive

1027
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
Percentage and so that allowed us to get

1028
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
To fetch Xing

1029
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,247
Call like when they send you a check

1030
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,111
I don't remember what it was in her bank account quickly

1031
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,207
An inch

1032
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
We could buy supplies

1033
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
And we could

1034
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
It was until we got paid by Traders

1035
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,775
And then Traders came back with another order of like 25 trucks

1036
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
Cuz it was going Bonker

1037
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
That that's when we turn the core

1038
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,991
How did you actually physically make all that popcorn

1039
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
How many mm

1040
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
You just have to hire

1041
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Tons of temporary people or

1042
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
Permit people like added that

1043
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
How'd you do that still working in the

1044
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Yeah

1045
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
Red X in hospital

1046
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Say that

1047
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
We were fortunate to

1048
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
To look to hire people during 2000

1049
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:33,311
7 in 2008 when the economy was started in the tank and so there were a lot of people looking for

1050
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
For working

1051
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
And you guys were not

1052
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,711
And that affected by the economic downturn and this is dance

1053
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
This strategy is when

1054
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
When things are going south

1055
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
He's going north

1056
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
You know so I think we

1057
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,975
We just knew that there was opportunity out there cuz a lot of big companies were pulling back during the

1058
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
The recession

1059
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,607
And we were getting vibes from stores and from Warehouse Costco and others

1060
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,935
That hey there's an opportunity here if you're willing to invest

1061
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
Is others are not

1062
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
And so we

1063
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Win 4

1064
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,919
At that time and and kind of said we'll do this this then that we kind of said yes to everything

1065
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,735
And we had because of that we had to hire a lot of people

1066
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Quickly

1067
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
2

1068
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,343
Working of plants we can manufacture enough to ship out

1069
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,671
So you are starting to sell that mean you're really good

1070
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
This is selling

1071
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Well

1072
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
At Trader Joe's

1073
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
Do you know what your Revenue was in 2009

1074
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Maybe

1075
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
34 million

1076
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
Pretty gray I mean you have started

1077
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,263
Realize there was

1078
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,895
A chancer until 2010 working as a nurse

1079
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
What was the turning point for you where you thought okay

1080
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,783
Now I'm going to be in this you know full time

1081
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
I'm going to stop

1082
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Enough

1083
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Well I had I had

1084
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Left

1085
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
The state

1086
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
Because there was very little flexibility

1087
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,559
Aunt at the state hospital so I had left the state and

1088
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,887
Started my own contracting business so that I could contract

1089
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,471
My time and have my own flexibility and say this is when I can work and I can't

1090
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
So you're still

1091
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
Basically

1092
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Supporting family

1093
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
Is not you are not taking income from the company

1094
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Quite yet

1095
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
Yeah we had a mortgage to in a cell

1096
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015
That was we were doing pretty well in

1097
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,551
In that regard bit

1098
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,927
But I started weaning my time back because Dan would call me and he would say okay we have a

1099
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,463
Costco meeting on May

1100
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
May 12th or whatever can you move your

1101
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Clinic around in

1102
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Go to Costco

1103
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Upshur

1104
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
When you did those meaning when you went to Costco how did you pitch them would would you Dan would you have Angie

1105
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,079
I'll be the face of the product and make the pitch or did you make the pitch or did you guys

1106
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
Bounce off each other like you doing now

1107
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
What initially I

1108
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,759
Did all the sales calls early on

1109
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,087
And then by the time we got to 2008-9 10

1110
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Especially

1111
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
After that when the end came on full-time

1112
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
They wanted to see her

1113
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
I mean sure her name was on the package

1114
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,071
And she

1115
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
You know told the story really well

1116
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
So I kind of

1117
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Took

1118
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,287
You know instead of just accepting Ops and sales and every I kind of stay focused on

1119
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,871
Kind of the operational side working with Greg my brother

1120
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,711
And kind of managing the team and answer focusing more on work

1121
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
With the sale sign

1122
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
You guys get a

1123
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
And an outside investor

1124
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
Sherbrooke

1125
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,159
Capitals VC firm

1126
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Come in

1127
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Make an offer

1128
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,511
Did you feel at that time you needed

1129
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
You needed to have that

1130
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Capital

1131
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
Growing in the way that you

1132
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Kelly wanted to

1133
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,055
Honestly we don't know what they wanted we don't really understand private-equity we didn't know I mean

1134
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,687
I was in a business person I I didn't know exactly how it work do you know and

1135
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,503
Anstine and so was more my brother Craig who

1136
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,575
I started taking some interest in that and

1137
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,671
He's the one who initiated the dialogue with Sherbrooke after they contacted

1138
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Asar

1139
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Funny he said you know we don't need the money now but if we're going to continue to grow we're going to need money sometime and we on

1140
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:13,471
Understood that because we had just been through years of like oh God we need money

1141
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,775
So even though we don't need it now it makes

1142
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,847
Complete sense to us and now we were in a position where we didn't

1143
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,663
Need it and that's the time to go ask for it so

1144
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Okay

1145
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Obviously helped because

1146
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,551
At that point you decide

1147
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,135
Begin a Rebrand and to introduce

1148
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,695
To move Beyond just kettle corn

1149
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,535
Right and they okay so he a couple things that when they

1150
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,607
When we decided when we understood what private Equity was

1151
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
It's about like I had only ever seen

1152
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Put in the movies and they were

1153
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,287
Deconstructing businesses and they were the bad guys

1154
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
These biscuits

1155
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
Private Equity was a

1156
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,967
Small shop and they were had built Brands and they were interested in

1157
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,807
Partnering and we said we wanted our people success to be

1158
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,415
You know 6s along with us can you help us figure out what to do and they helped

1159
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,207
Set up

1160
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,999
An employee Equity pool

1161
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
They helped us set up a board

1162
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
The setup

1163
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,911
Professional sales team and build a marketing team

1164
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
A whole.new

1165
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
Entirely new ball game

1166
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
Like we understood partnership cuz Dan and I were in partner

1167
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
The tollway and so now we just had another partner

1168
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
You know we had

1169
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
We were now

1170
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
Our business with marrying their business

1171
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
Until what was the impetus to

1172
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
Your kettle corn is your bread-and-butter right what is the impetus

1173
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
At that point

1174
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
To go to

1175
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Yo

1176
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,071
Salted Popcorn buttered popcorn other flavors was it

1177
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,911
Was it that was it was at other people saying hey you know we want

1178
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Flavors

1179
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,799
Well in 2011 we were the natural and organic snacks

1180
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:57,919
Right so that's where we live Costco

1181
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
Target display

1182
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
Yes for a Target and

1183
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,879
And in a lot of regional grocery chains doing very well in the natural organic sex

1184
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
But it is to me when I looked at it on the Shelf it looks very masculine

1185
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,863
I used to walk the stores and just

1186
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Stare

1187
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
You know stare at the

1188
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Best healthy snacks

1189
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,847
Does the national organic snacks that were aimed at women I thought looks like they assumed we were all on a diet

1190
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,407
And so I was like

1191
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Okay

1192
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
Like we can do that but we don't have to

1193
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
To do it in that way

1194
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:40,415
So let's do that along with our kettle corn let's do more let's we built out

1195
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
And Innovation started

1196
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,487
Product Innovation map

1197
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,351
And started looking at Innovation as more than just the product but in the messaging app

1198
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
Did you I mean it

1199
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
This is also coincides with like the gluten

1200
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Free

1201
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
Explosion right which we are still in

1202
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
Did that did you also

1203
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,127
Will you also able to kind of ride that wave

1204
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
We absolutely we would have mothers

1205
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
It's calling us

1206
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
Saying is your product certified gluten-free

1207
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
This was early on

1208
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,623
Dan cell phone was on every single pack

1209
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,463
Because that was our business is our business number

1210
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
And so

1211
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,375
His cell phone was ringing it would be some mom standing in front of a Costco pallet thing is here is this allergen-free

1212
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
What's the reason I did it I did it early on before

1213
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,543
We were very big and I want it all complaints

1214
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
To come to me

1215
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
And it just

1216
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
We never ended up taking it off

1217
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:39,295
Until come through

1218
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,183
We heard all these mothers calling us yet we got to get certified gluten-free so we did

1219
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
2011

1220
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
You decide

1221
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
2

1222
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Find

1223
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Somebody help me

1224
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
With a new name

1225
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
Google branding age

1226
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
We don't yet

1227
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,239
And what and what what names do they come up with

1228
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,615
For really boring ones and one that I thought we thought was interesting

1229
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
It was called boom chicka pow pow

1230
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
Good name

1231
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Why we laugh

1232
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
Bright light

1233
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Richard Powell

1234
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,879
And it just the brief was like hey

1235
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
We don't want to be diet

1236
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
We want to

1237
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
Elicit curiosity

1238
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
We want to

1239
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Something different

1240
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
We want to be celebratory

1241
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
And come from a pig

1242
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,375
Addition of empowerment

1243
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,935
So this is going to be Angie's boomchickapop

1244
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Pow wow

1245
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
Pelon pelo

1246
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
The days that

1247
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,311
We were all at one table

1248
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
Together and we had a business

1249
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
Analysts at the end of the

1250
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,943
The table eavesdropping on the presentation

1251
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,319
And after the creative agency laughed he said you know boom chicka pow pow is 70s

1252
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,047
That would not go down well in the Mennonite Church

1253
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
No

1254
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,887
It would not be said and how did

1255
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,215
Do you know

1256
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031
So we said okay but if there was energy

1257
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
You know the rest energy and it and it it has

1258
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
Struck the right tone

1259
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,223
We just told him go back and fix it they came back bun

1260
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527
Chicka Pop we launched it in May of 2000

1261
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
12

1262
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
How to draw

1263
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,927
Customer base respond to the new name

1264
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
But we have buyers

1265
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Said said

1266
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:31,167
Sprite and and we don't really like it they don't really get it

1267
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
Wechat people internally that said don't

1268
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
Don't do this

1269
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
You know

1270
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,871
There were two of us women on the leadership

1271
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,991
Mary Hanrahan was our marketing director and myself and we

1272
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
Fought like

1273
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,551
Yes we want this

1274
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,855
Because it is

1275
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
We are not going to do and she's Nearly Naked we're not going to do and she's skinny we're not going to do Angie's whatever

1276
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
That is right we want to own something else

1277
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
It's going to be fun

1278
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,703
It's going to be creative it's going to be dimensional it's going to celebrate

1279
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
The feminine and

1280
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,287
You know for years women have bought

1281
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
Chips

1282
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
Send everything that

1283
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,991
I had that you know are marketed to men and we don't think of thing about it and so why not

1284
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,807
Put a package out there that appeals to women

1285
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,671
And I will stand and it was at first non-GMO branded popcorn

1286
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
On the market and it it be

1287
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
Became our number one selling

1288
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
Xq informant

1289
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
After 9

1290
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
Wow

1291
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,727
So I think around 2014

1292
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,543
Tpg growth comes in a bigger

1293
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
Private Equity Firm they buy out

1294
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
And

1295
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
And take a pretty big steak in a cup

1296
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Company and

1297
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
It's real money

1298
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,295
And I think

1299
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,111
At that point you guys started to distribute

1300
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,647
Money to

1301
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,207
People who have been with you and work with you for a long time

1302
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,791
Yeah those granted Equity shares

1303
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Became liquid

1304
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
For our staff

1305
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,007
Best three days of my career probably was transformational right

1306
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
I think so

1307
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Yeah

1308
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:17,407
Remember

1309
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
Remember how much money you were able to

1310
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Millions

1311
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,759
Millions of dollars wow

1312
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
And I mean

1313
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
Probably doesn't happen very often in Mankato right

1314
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
Like a liquidy

1315
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,023
A liquidity event I'm not I mean right now

1316
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,071
It doesn't do it was an emotional

1317
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,887
Time I mean it was you know

1318
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
For everyone that

1319
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Had given

1320
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,287
You know everything to us for in the company and and

1321
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
I mean it's still emotionally

1322
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Thinking about it but

1323
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
It was

1324
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,455
It was kind of a thank you to everybody

1325
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
And then we got to do it again

1326
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,855
And 2017-2017

1327
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
ConAgra

1328
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Huge

1329
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Company that owns

1330
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
Many brands

1331
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Buys out

1332
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Door Company

1333
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Reportedly

1334
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Quarter of a billion dollars

1335
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Astounding

1336
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Quarter of a billion dollars

1337
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Prpopcorn

1338
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:17,055
I mean

1339
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
And the brand I mean

1340
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Talk about it

1341
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
Great 8000

1342
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,735
$10,000 a day for a fly by night

1343
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Kettle corn

1344
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Kettle

1345
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
Man

1346
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
Now world

1347
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Wish I saw that

1348
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Add on Google

1349
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
2001

1350
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
So they buy it out and

1351
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
I mean

1352
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
What

1353
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
Did you even have time to absorb what that meant I mean

1354
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,727
Where you just

1355
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:51,871
I don't know the last 3 years from 14217 1/20 PT came on

1356
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,919
We sold

1357
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,223
Pretty picture of our ownership

1358
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
The tpg

1359
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
I mean

1360
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,599
I think if we had to jump out in 14 it would have been really hot

1361
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
But we we we were

1362
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,487
Have 3 years run where we were able to kind of slowly step

1363
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,791
And participate

1364
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,607
As much as we wanted to and as much as

1365
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
The staff needed

1366
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,703
And so I think when 17 came

1367
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,519
It was the 14th sale

1368
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,823
Was much more emotional

1369
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
In the sense because it was like

1370
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
Oh my God we did it

1371
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Yeah

1372
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
And that whole thing about like Haley

1373
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,271
We started this to

1374
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
Put our kids through college and have enough money

1375
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,647
Yeah now we're doing that for

1376
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,183
All the other people

1377
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
People

1378
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
I mean you also

1379
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
I know you are

1380
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Brandon Bass

1381
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
And you are on contract with

1382
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
ConAgra and then are you involved with the company at all

1383
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Donnatal

1384
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,943
The fact that you came into such a

1385
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
Substantial amount of

1386
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Of money

1387
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,575
Has it substantially changed your lives

1388
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Has it

1389
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
CNN Sohail

1390
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,487
Yeah I mean

1391
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,047
I don't wear Minnesota don't like to talk about money

1392
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
I think

1393
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,727
Yeah it's I mean you know we just weave

1394
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
Got into

1395
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
This later in life

1396
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
And so

1397
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
I mean

1398
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,431
I'm still wearing these jeans that I've had for 10 years so

1399
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
Those are nice dads

1400
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
Yeah I noticed those

1401
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,367
I noticed those jeans

1402
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,767
But yeah it's allowed us it's giving us an opportunity to

1403
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,047
Do things that

1404
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Never would have

1405
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,679
Could you have imagined when you

1406
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Order that

1407
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,775
Cattle and it arrived in your garage and you were like

1408
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,103
Mexican burning the corn the popcorn like

1409
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,431
That you would go on it would go on to be purchased for

1410
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,223
Order of a billion dollars like

1411
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
16 years later could you

1412
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,575
Could you imagine that

1413
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
No

1414
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,135
No never

1415
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Not even not even

1416
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Probably

1417
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
Halfway through or 3/4 the way through did we think about it in

1418
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,119
And that way I mean it was just for us looking at the next Horizon

1419
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
Nginx

1420
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Thing that we needed

1421
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,959
Get to do and the next right thing

1422
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
That we needed to do

1423
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,079
I think more engine or just talking about this

1424
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,151
I think more contemporary entrepreneurs

1425
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
Probably are thinking that way

1426
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,783
I mean we start in 2001 I think for us

1427
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
He was just

1428
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,623
Kind of knot on the radar and it wasn't like

1429
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
Everyone was starting up food companies or

1430
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,999
You know different businesses as much as it is today

1431
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
For us

1432
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
It just kind of grew

1433
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
We grew into a

1434
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,607
Anchor into the Good Fortune of it

1435
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Happening

1436
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
I have

1437
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Done

1438
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Interviews with

1439
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,519
Cofounders who were married

1440
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,311
4 and are still married

1441
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
Some cases

1442
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
Melissa & Doug

1443
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
Are still married but then there have been examples we had an episode recently EO products

1444
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
Leaderboard

1445
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
They kept the company going

1446
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
You guys

1447
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
Had a marriage

1448
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,671
Your family a partnership

1449
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,743
I was just running just just being married and having kids

1450
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Write anyone who's

1451
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Experiences that their stress

1452
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,399
Raichu argue and and that's normal but

1453
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,191
Running a business together on

1454
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,983
Top of that in a business that

1455
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
For years and years

1456
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Grind

1457
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,847
Really know if it's working and

1458
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
People calling their stress

1459
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
How do you

1460
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Survive

1461
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
That's hilarious

1462
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
You know

1463
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,583
At the end of the day it's about love right like you just

1464
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
You decide

1465
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
Do you love this person yes

1466
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
UW are you willing to

1467
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,007
Commit to this person no matter what

1468
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
Yes

1469
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
You know and

1470
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
And I think

1471
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,383
For Dan and I we both had that sort of

1472
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Frame of mind

1473
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
And

1474
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
You know it it doesn't make it

1475
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Easier

1476
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
But I think that

1477
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
You know both

1478
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
He and I have the

1479
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
Mindset that

1480
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,695
We're going to make something work

1481
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,511
And I'll by God if anybody can make it work will make

1482
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Make it work

1483
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
And

1484
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,863
You know it I think it just took

1485
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,703
With the business and with our marriage just recommitment

1486
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
All the time

1487
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,799
You know every day every week whatever

1488
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
Whatever it meant

1489
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
Yeah

1490
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,223
Do you think Danforth you do you think that

1491
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,503
What you achieved

1492
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,879
And his business was a result of your work and your scale when your intelligence or do you think that luck played a big part

1493
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
I knew this question was coming

1494
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
Lol you know

1495
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Guy

1496
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
I think

1497
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,679
There's a ton of good fortune that is coming our way

1498
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,751
People have been so embracing and in

1499
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,335
Incontinent helpful and so many ways so many people in this crowd

1500
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
Is the reason we're up here

1501
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,687
But we put a lot of

1502
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,015
Energy into creating an environment that

1503
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Was about

1504
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,575
Giving

1505
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
To the consumer giving to the

1506
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
The customer

1507
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:28,511
I think there's some skill in that I think I was blessed with the ability to interact with people and

1508
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,839
Build rapport pretty quickly and I knew the importance of that

1509
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,887
And and

1510
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,471
Had so many other gifts the marking side the creative side that

1511
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
Initial Finance side

1512
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,359
That we were able to understand our talents and pull it together and

1513
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:50,015
You know no doubt there is Good Fortune a lock that comes your way at the right time things happen a credit card mailing comes in

1514
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:55,135
I mean it's there is there's luck involved in this and we were just

1515
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,231
Fortunate at the right time we made some good decisions and rebound it

1516
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Well from some bad to sit

1517
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Angie

1518
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
You know I've seen a lot of

1519
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,215
Really good people work

1520
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
Just as hard as us

1521
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Or harder

1522
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
And not experience

1523
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
The same

1524
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
Fortune

1525
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
That we've had

1526
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,151
And so

1527
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
I think

1528
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
It does

1529
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,271
Take I mean we made a conscious effort to

1530
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,551
To create Goodwill

1531
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
And positivity

1532
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
And when you do that

1533
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,927
I believe that that comes back to you

1534
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,231
But you can't do it without hard work

1535
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655

2001
