To see you there and then

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,320
Here is the show

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
The manufacturer that I had started with didn't have a depth of

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing which is this product has to be very durable

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
It's a wonder that very fairly large lots of inventory we ordered arrived

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
And yeah we sold out of everything out of stock by the time it arrived in desperate to ship

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
But we hooked up the first suspension trainer lean back and the handles just cracked like

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Potato chips

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Ron NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Idealist and the stories behind the movements they built

32
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
And Gyros and former Navy SEAL turned into a

33
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,576
Fitness Phenom knockout TRX nearly lost it all when copycats

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,816
It's unlikely you'll find a gym in America or for that matter in most parts of the world

35
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
Without TRX

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
And if you're not familiar with them.

37
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
Heavy duty nylon straps that hang from an anchor in the ceiling

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
What is foam rubber grips

39
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,176
A simple straps you can do rose or lunges push-ups

40
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Pull ups

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
You can slip your feet into these Loops at the bottom and work on your core or your legs to your ex is like

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,928
A full body workout machine and yes it is just

43
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
Two straps hanging from an anchor in the ceiling

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,632
The company says that today more than 25000 gyms have them

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Something like

46
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
95% of all professional sports teams in the u.s. use them and what's amazing about the car

47
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
Concept is that the inventor and founder of the company Randy hetrick

48
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
Literally needed something to help him stay fit during long deployments as a Navy SEAL

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,368
It was back in 1997 and at the time

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,512
Randy and his Seal Team we're on a mission to find pirates in Southeast Asia

51
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
Where little Warehouse kind of waiting to see

52
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
You know what was going to happen and a day turned into a week turned into a couple weeks

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
You don't really have a a good way to

54
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
Train other than stuff

55
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Did the Romans did in the way back you know push-ups and

56
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Squats and sit-ups

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
None of that

58
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Get you

59
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
Really prepared to climb the side of a freighter with

60
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
You know 80 pounds of gear on your back

61
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
And I had accidentally

62
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Deployed with

63
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
My Jiu-Jitsu belt stuffed into my bag I just scooped it up off my cage

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Yoga flight suit

65
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
I'm turning into a bag without realizing I had it in

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
As I was sitting there on this cot listening to guys gripe about not being able to work out

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
I just got this idea that hey I wonder if I went and

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Tied a knot in the end of this silly belt that I

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Deployed here with

70
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
Threw it over the top of that door over there

71
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
What if I could lean back

72
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
And then pull my body up

73
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
And I just kind of created this movement

74
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
That looked a lot like

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
Climbing a ladder and then figured out how to use my body weight

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Loaded up

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
And that was you know that was the spark of inspiration

78
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
And you just found like some doors in this Warehouse

79
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
To you

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Connected to

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
The first one was actually a bathroom door

82
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
And yeah I just

83
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
Tied a knot in the end of it through the top of the door close the door

84
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Then lean back

85
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
Started to lift my body weight

86
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Against Gravity

87
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Which turns out

88
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Pretty effective I'm pretty versatile

89
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
See what I'm grabbing the ends of this like

90
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Jiu jitsu belt and

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Doing pull-ups in

92
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
Imagine that you had something that looks like an upside down y

93
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511
Write-up on anchor and that goes up over the top of the door

94
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
And then kind of two arms

95
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
That come off of that cuz I stitched the the two pieces together with his hand all that we would use to repair

96
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Rubber boats with

97
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,847
And you know just lean back and grab each side and started figuring out a window

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Can do rose I can do curls

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,063
Shoulder flys by turn around and lean away from the door I can work the whole front side of my body

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
Chest presses and chest flys

101
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
No standing planks for my core and then

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Use it as a balance point

103
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,583
To do squats single leg squats and lunges and it just kind of became like a

104
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Flower

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
They continued to open up and expose new pedals

106
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
You know the more that I worked with

107
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
When you started to

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Kids like

109
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Do these exercises

110
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Tennis Warehouse

111
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Waiting for a mission to

112
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Begin what are the other

113
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Members of the Seal team

114
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Think about it

115
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Well I mean

116
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
You got to realize it's a group of

117
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Pack alpha

118
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Females said the first thing they do is come over and mock you

119
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Try to say what the heck

120
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
And then

121
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Then very quickly

122
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
It'll seals are Innovative cats and when it comes to

123
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
You know exercise

124
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Everybody sort of interested in so literally

125
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Yogeshwar

126
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
MC

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Can we do this and can we do this and

128
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
You know over the course of

129
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
The next Maybe

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
3-6 months

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
I just kept tweaking it and you know guys would have ideas on

132
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Hey maybe we should put Loops in the

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
It Advanced at some level but then it kind of froze

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
At the level that I thought it needed to be

135
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
Because I never viewed this

136
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
I wouldn't think about business

137
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
I just thought it was kind of cool that I

138
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
Created this

139
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Nifty tool

140
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
That guy's

141
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
You know light

142
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
And wanted and so I had a

143
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
A friend who was a parachute rigger out in

144
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Apparel off to

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Started making them

146
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
Four guys in exchange for a case of beer

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,503
And you call me and say you know a boss you know Jones wants me to make one your gizmos

148
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
I got okay

149
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
And I say yeah go for

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
And over the course of a couple years it just kind of proliferated within that

151
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Unit

152
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
So when did you

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Start to sink a maybe yeah yeah

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
Well I I was promoted out of the field

155
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
And at that point

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
You know my wife was

157
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
We sort of done with the superhero

158
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Gone all the time lifestyle and

159
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
Add a promotion out to the West Coast

160
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
In her career and so we kind of cut a deal that

161
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
I would have

162
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Reply to

163
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
Business school at Stanford

164
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
And if I got in then I would

165
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Resign my commission and

166
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
You know move out there

167
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
And I thought that was at that point the safest bet on Earth

168
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
25 years I wasn't very good at it

169
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Back then

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
But to my astonishment

171
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,471
They took me in spite of my scores 2001

172
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah

173
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,823
And I went out there and while I was at Stanford

174
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
I was able to go out and train in the athlete

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
Weight training center and I would show up with mice traps

176
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Hook em up

177
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
This world-class training facility

178
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
Over the course of six or eight months

179
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
I mean darn near every one of the coaches that would be in there with her team

180
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Came over in

181
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,071
Tell me about this thing you know in 10 minutes later they be selling me on

182
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
What a great idea it would be for there

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Every every one of their athlete

184
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
90 lb female tennis players that are 300 pound lineman

185
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
And that was when I started to think

186
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
I wonder

187
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
I wonder if

188
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
I can do something with this

189
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Yep and

190
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
I ended up deciding to take

191
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Summer

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Between my first and second

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
Year and instead of going off and doing some cushy

194
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
You know paying internships

195
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
McKenzie

196
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
I bought a $50 40 year old sewing machine off of Geary Street some little old sewing

197
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Shop and

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Sat down in my garage you know you had a so

199
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Because as a young seal officer you had to

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Go out

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,567
You know buy a case of beer for the rigor and have him teach you how to sew so you could customize

202
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Gear

203
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,431
And so I so I had some rudimentary sewing skills and

204
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Can I just

205
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,551
You know started creating some different versions of the prototypes and optimizing the design

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
And what were you making it out of

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
At that time

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Nylon

209
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
Yeah Cordura nylon that I would buy

210
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Bits of Hardware that I needed and not

211
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
You put put the thing together

212
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
And so that's summer you you were just

213
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
Basically sewing up a bunch of

214
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Different versions of it or you were just

215
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,239
Making the same thing over and over and over again

216
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
No I probably did 50 different

217
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Conversions

218
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
And it it seems funny

219
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
Right when you think of all the things just a darn strap

220
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
But

221
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
There's a lot of different ways you can make a strap

222
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Turns out and

223
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
You know I'd make it night

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
I tried out and then I think I will write that's a little better but that caused some unintended consequence that I don't like so I'd work

225
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Around that

226
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
And I don't have any money

227
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
So

228
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
You know I probably spent

229
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:43,167
How much time with a razor blade my hand stripping the pieces back apart so that I didn't have to

230
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Yeah reorder them as I did some of them together

231
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,591
But over time you know you swear to work out the Kinks and by the time that I got to my

232
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Second earring

233
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
School

234
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
I had

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Stabilized prototype

236
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
And I also during that

237
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
Summer I had gone over and found a

238
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
A guy over in

239
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Hong Kong

240
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
The manufacturing rep who would make

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
Back short

242
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Lot for me of alpha prototypes

243
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
So you

244
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
You get to that summer and you get back to school in

245
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
In the fall and what did you do did you like bring it to

246
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Classmates

247
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
It said business school and say Hey try this out

248
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
How are you been test

249
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
I became

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
You know a bit of a fanatic

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
With my idea and

252
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
I mean anybody who is at Stanford Business School

253
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Between 2001a

254
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Get out 2000

255
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
For will tell you I remember that cat

256
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,647
You know cuz I I smoker everybody in on every class project

257
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
That got assigned I turned into a

258
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
A incubator if you will

259
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
For what would become TRX

260
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
And

261
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
You know we had event sometimes

262
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
On Fridays the blow off steam they were

263
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
Liquidity preference functions

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Which basically meant

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Tapping a keg

266
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
And hanging out together and I would

267
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
Bring out mice traps and get people on them

268
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
It was this great incubator

269
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Where I learned all kinds of stuff

270
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
And it was

271
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
1 extended Focus Group

272
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Taught me a lot about

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
You know what people liked

274
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Didn't like

275
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
About this

276
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Contraption that I

277
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Proposing to sell

278
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
You

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
You graduate from Stanford

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
An end

281
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
What do you just

282
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
You decide

283
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
I'm going to launch this thing

284
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Yeah by that point I had

285
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
You know I had

286
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Add my mind said that I was going to take a run at

287
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
This and I was a little old to be

288
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Yella recent

289
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Graduated

290
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
Business school program granddaddy in my class by about

291
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
I don't know for 6 years his you are what

292
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
3636

293
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
And so I figured I had one

294
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Opportunity to try and

295
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Fail

296
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Before I had to get serious about

297
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
You know of a paying job

298
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,215
You know my mentors at Stanford at the time we're trying to convince me to do something more sensible

299
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
This is just a

300
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Stupid idea

301
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Well I mean it at the time Garth saloner was

302
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,479
Was one of my end up becoming the dean there he was one of my professors and he said you know Brandy

303
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
I can get you

304
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Any number

305
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
Great paying jobs in Silicon Valley

306
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
What's your background

307
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Don't do this

308
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
But I swear that

309
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
I have my headset on it

310
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
And so I got out

311
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Kind of want to ask

312
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
So how did you even have the money to

313
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
To start to manufacture these into 2

314
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Build a company

315
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Well I didn't have any money

316
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Because

317
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,407
Yeah my my career is a government servant hadn't produced the giant pile of wealth

318
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
But I did have had about fifty Grand

319
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
In savings and I put it all in

320
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
Canada First Steps the initial prototypes and then

321
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
I'm pursuing

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
A little bit of

323
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
Guangzhou property

324
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Which thank goodness

325
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
I became really important

326
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Even recently

327
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
What did you do did you

328
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Did you just file a bunch of

329
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Patents for for this

330
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
The Stanford lyrics

331
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
Characteristics in those designs that that I had created that

332
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
I thought were

333
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Really special in

334
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Would fundamentally

335
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Differentiate this product

336
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
From what if I was successful expected

337
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Did the Bee you know I heard of

338
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Copy

339
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Cats

340
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
And so I went

341
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Patented those unique features

342
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
And then I file some trademarks on Kennedy

343
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Chucky

344
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Terminology

345
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
That I was going to try to build our brand around

346
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Brandon was one of the concepts that I

347
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
I really learned

348
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
At Stanford

349
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
2 in 2005

350
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
When you launch the company

351
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
Tell me how you start to get the word out about

352
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
Update the system because this was not

353
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Really liked it out

354
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
How did you get

355
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
People to

356
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Take you serious

357
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
Well I think a lot of people didn't take me seriously initially but I I did it in sort of the

358
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
You're the least sexy way possible

359
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Hydro

360
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Around initially around Northern California in my car with my wingman blueberry my dog in the past

361
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Backpack full of straps

362
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
And I went Jim to gym to gym to gym

363
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
Doing these little presentations to their staff

364
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Trainers

365
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
And I would usually have to

366
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
You know bags of Fitness manager to give me

367
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,879
Half hour of their weekly in-service with her staff and then I would leave a couple of straps behind

368
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,743
And I'll bet you that I did in the first couple of years after business school I probably did

369
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
Between 3 and 500 presentations around the country

370
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
And you would get the Skeptics for sure a lot of the big dudes that

371
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah we're used to throwing around a lot of weight they would sort of look at me like a

372
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
You know what is what is this

373
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
This little girly machine that you got here

374
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
But I would quickly

375
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
Disabuse them of the belief that it wasn't for them

376
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
And then after that right people would sort of

377
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
Be interested and I would leave a couple behind

378
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,951
And it was just you know one gym at a time one trainer at a time

379
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Started to make a little progress

380
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
Well I mean a lot of relative thing from zero

381
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
10 is a lot and so yeah I started

382
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
I started to get what I viewed as a lot

383
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
It was Signs of Life

384
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
And I was fulfilling them out of this this really

385
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
McKenna pathetic little

386
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
Almost a shed that I was renting out in the

387
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Western edge of the sunset District in San Francisco

388
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
And I would

389
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
Do you know I was everything I would fulfill them

390
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
I had a little inkjet printer and was running the

391
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,703
The enterprise software out-of-area desktop at my feet

392
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
And then you know then I met a gal who

393
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Was a waitress by night but

394
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
Help me with the office stuff by day

395
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
And I we just started to

396
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Plug away and ship out of everything happened out of that little 1500 square foot shop out in the

397
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
The sunset

398
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
What was it

399
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
What was the turning point when did you

400
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Start to

401
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Feel like

402
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
This thing is really

403
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Taking out what happened

404
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
It's funny how people talk about tipping

405
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,239
Points my experience is a little different I think it's kind of a series of tipping points that

406
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
You know they get

407
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
Relatively bigger if you're fortunate overtime but

408
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
One of the early ones was I went down to a

409
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Do a trade show down in San Diego

410
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
Call The Idea World Fitness convention

411
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
And I

412
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
Set up 10 x 10 booth down there and I had this

413
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
Can a fake door that I had put together and

414
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
To Anchor it

415
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
And we ended up selling out everything we had

416
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Well and I had to have my assistant

417
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Overnight me

418
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
You know what we have left

419
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,007
In the shop there to the second day of the shows at three day show the second day I was basically selling paper

420
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Futures

421
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
And then

422
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
Thank goodness the product arrived on the third day in the people become an exchange their paper for

423
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Four straps

424
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,295
And that was a big moment because I realized all right these trainers are a skeptical lot

425
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
But if they think this is really a great thing

426
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
All right now I'm

427
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
I'm cooking with some gas you know

428
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And so that was kind of

429
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,839
Tipping Point one and then shortly thereafter I started to get exposed to some

430
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
Athletes

431
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
And ended up

432
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
Connecting with a cat that probably most of your listings

433
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,079
I've heard of name Drew Brees very early and I in his career so before he became the

434
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Super Bowl

435
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,247
Starting quarterback for that for the Saints before he became the Drew Brees that we all know today and he was the same guy then but you just didn't know about him

436
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
And he did just torn his

437
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Is rotator cuff

438
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Finished running

439
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Which quarterbacks tends to be a

440
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Career-ender

441
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
And he had just been released from

442
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
The Chargers and was doing rehab

443
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
And he fell in love with the suspension

444
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Wow thank goodness and so did that

445
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Was that

446
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Would started to get a lot of attention for

447
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
System

448
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
What he ended up

449
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
But when he went to New Orleans

450
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
He ended up saying to me you don't hate Randy give me

451
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
You'll have to ask me these I'll take him with me

452
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
And

453
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
You know I'll see if I can get the Saints to start raining on them

454
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
And he had a opportunity with Sports Illustrated

455
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Early on to do a story about his comeback and he

456
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Was very kind and

457
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
You know just a sort of scratch my back

458
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Make sure that

459
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
The picture that they featured was him training on the suspension trainer

460
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
And all the sudden

461
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
All the strength and conditioning coaches and athletes

462
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Weights that reads

463
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Sports Illustrated

464
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Got their eyes on this crazy strap

465
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
That will make it happen

466
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
You know the Big Challenge

467
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
For somebody who's starting Adventure

468
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Chiqle if you got a

469
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Product

470
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
There isn't President

471
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
The big challenges obscurity

472
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
And trying to get

473
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
Out of obscurity and get up on the

474
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
On the radar

475
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
When you don't have

476
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Much money is

477
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Is very challenging

478
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
And

479
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
At first you think that's you know boy once we once we break out

480
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
It'll just all be Duck Soup

481
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
From that point forward

482
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
You know what I was I was in vision

483
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Napping on piles of hundred dollar bills

484
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
But it didn't quite work out that way

485
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Because as soon as you start to hit scale

486
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Then a hole

487
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Other host

488
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,207
Of challenges begins to Avail themselves and you have to Wrangle each one wanted

489
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Time

490
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Watford

491
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
One of the specific challenges that

492
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
I faced early was

493
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
The manufacturer that I had started with who was a good guy

494
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
But didn't have a

495
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Depth of

496
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,615
Manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was Brave

497
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Which is this product durable

498
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:35,039
It's a one of the very early large lots of inventory we ordered

499
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Arrived

500
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
And we're out of stock by the time it arrived

501
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
And desperate to ship

502
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
What we hooked up the first suspension trainer lean back and the handles

503
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
Just cracked like potato chips and

504
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
It turns out that this manufacturer

505
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
Had gone to a sub manufacturer

506
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
And found somebody who would do

507
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
The subcomponents more cheaply

508
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
And had mentioned this

509
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
And we didn't have time to send this stuff back and so we ended up having to manually strip these things apart set up an

510
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
Basically an assembly line with a bandsaw went and got

511
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
A bunch of Plumbing

512
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Pipe from

513
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,071
Home Depot and literally had to set up this little

514
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
Manufacturing

515
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
Plant if you will in our little office there

516
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
And that was inefficient to say the least but we managed to work our way through

517
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Through and survived it

518
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
But I had several product problem

519
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
Like that that came from

520
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
A manufacturer

521
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,951
Trying to improve his margins and know this is something that in a manufacturing world

522
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
People called

523
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Quality fade

524
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
And it's a big problem

525
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
When you manufactured

526
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
China

527
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
So you have this

528
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
This product on in the world end

529
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
I would think that

530
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Once you start to become

531
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Successful

532
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
There will be other companies

533
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
I thought I would go this weekend just

534
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
Crush this guy cuz we can just make a similar thing and

535
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Make it cheaper or whatever

536
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Yeah that

537
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
That is

538
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
The single biggest problem that I have faced

539
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
In my

540
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Careers

541
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Nor and frankly it's a

542
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
It's a problem that is

543
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Dabbling

544
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Yeah the entire

545
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Shimmer

546
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Product space

547
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
It started with us

548
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Literally about 6 or 7 years into our

549
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Evolution

550
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
I had somebody call me and say yeah

551
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
I think I just saw counter

552
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
TRX bicep

553
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
That's impossible right

554
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
And it turned out

555
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
That's

556
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Fact

557
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
The rise of the internet

558
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Was changing every

559
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
And it was creating an environment

560
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
In which these little manufacturers over in

561
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
Uniworld China

562
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
Suddenly had visibility

563
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Over products that seem to be hot

564
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
So if you have a one-size-fits-all safe

565
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
For instance a Gucci bag or or Louis

566
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
One bag that has a high sale price

567
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Perception of a low cost of goods

568
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
You end up being a

569
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Perfect Target

570
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,504
And we had an explosion of counterfeiting

571
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
That just rolled across the market

572
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136

Gyros

607
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
So it's around 2010

608
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
And T-Rex is

609
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280

Cross the country

613
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
The problem is

614
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
The exercise straps

615
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Are also popular with counterfeiters

616
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
In the knockouts

617
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
Eating into the company's bottom line

618
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
Randy decides to hire an investor

619
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
To figure out

620
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
How many counterfeiters

621
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,624
Are out there and they found about 20 different factories scattered around China

622
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
That were all creating

623
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Fake

624
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Counterfeit

625
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
TRX suspension trainer and yeah it was it was really it was a it was a shock and it

626
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
Put huge pressure

627
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
On the entire business mod

628
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
I kiss if you have Distributors they're trying to sell

629
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,360
The authentic product at full price but then they've got these kind of shadowy operators that

630
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
Pop up all around them in the internet

631
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Tables

632
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
This in a way that

633
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
Generations of entrepreneurs never had to deal with

634
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
And so pretty soon you always

635
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
They're everywhere

636
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,208
Figuring out how to Wrangle that was job number one

637
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
So what did you do attitude

638
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Squash

639
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
He's these guys were eating into your business

640
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
They were devouring

641
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,472
My business you know the stories are Legend of companies that

642
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Yeah I had great promising Futures that

643
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
Basically went out of business because of counterfeiting

644
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
I think that I was fortunate in that

645
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
It was the early stages where people were starting

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
On the enforcement side

647
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Starting to

648
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
Get a sense that hey this counterfeiting business is bad and

649
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
We're going to have to do something

650
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
Customs with starting to ramp up

651
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Its efforts

652
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
And

653
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Fortunately counterfeiting

654
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Felony so

655
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
When you identify them

656
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Everyone wants

657
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
To take them down

658
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
And so we started this process of

659
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Seizures in China

660
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
With the cooperation

661
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Sound level with Chinese police

662
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,200
And then in the states and in Europe most of the the Customs agencies

663
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Seize the counterfeit Goods

664
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
So that sort of started to subside

665
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
But what

666
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Placed it

667
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Was that

668
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
The counterfeiters figured out

669
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,232
If we don't put this Brands trademark

670
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
On our Prada

671
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,840
And we just copy the actual design itself without the

672
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
The trademark

673
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,400
Then it's technically not a counterfeit

674
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
And so

675
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
It becomes

676
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
Much harder to him

677
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Enforce against and I was the next big way

678
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
What's the knock-offs

679
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
That were copying

680
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
Our designs to the

681
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
But not

682
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
Calling themselves TRX

683
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Wow what happened

684
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,464
Will Amazon and the other online marketplaces but particularly Amazon because of its scale

685
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
This

686
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Hotbed

687
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
If you will I'm an auction site

688
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,656
For all of these knock-off vendors

689
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Who would

690
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
Misappropriate are trademarks

691
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Use them in

692
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Search

693
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Marketing

694
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
And so when you for instance Geico

695
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Came looking for TRX on an

696
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
You would be served up

697
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Our product

698
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Alongside

699
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
A host of others

700
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
Others that are 1/4 the price affect the price because

701
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Of course they're not having to

702
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Spend any money to

703
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,512
Develop the market or get you there

704
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Really experienced

705
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,680
A flattening and actually a negative growth for a couple of years 2014 and 2015

706
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Wow has the Sea of knock-offs

707
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Confuse the market

708
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
I mean

709
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
You are

710
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
An alpha male

711
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Urocele

712
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
You're a manly guy

713
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
But I mean let's be honest

714
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
There's no way

715
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
You didn't experience

716
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,392
Anxiety or depression or

717
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Like fear

718
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
All of that

719
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
Oh that maybe even a few tears guy you know

720
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
Because there was a period of time when I was

721
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Well I could make

722
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
These guys go

723
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
Right

724
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
I have a certain skill set

725
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,408
But you know that you have to look away from the light quickly and say no no no this is not what your brain should go

726
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Yeah I learned some skills as a seal

727
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
About how to manage

728
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Fear

729
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
And stress and

730
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
Sort of involves a combination of

731
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Compartmentalization

732
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
An action

733
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
And so that's how I kind of

734
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
Deal with

735
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Entrepreneurial

736
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Fear and stress is

737
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
You know you put it in a box

738
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
Figure out how you can take action on it

739
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
And then you move forward to your next task at hand

740
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
And hope the

741
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
You know that sticks

742
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Works

743
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
That pointed you

744
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Like what did you do

745
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Ultimately we

746
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
We decided that we had to take the dreaded

747
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Step of our first litigation action

748
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
I am we picked

749
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,184
One of these knock-offs to go after

750
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
The federal patent and trademark and

751
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Infringement suit

752
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,536
Because we knew

753
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
If we want it was unlikely that we would

754
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
Be able to collect any significant damages cuz these

755
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
These knock off

756
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
Companies don't tend to

757
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,776
You don't maintain a bunch of cash on hand

758
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,104
But we knew that it as a legal precedent

759
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
It could be what we needed to

760
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Clean up the market

761
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Replace and so we

762
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Filed up federal

763
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,600
Patent suit and trademark suit against one of the largest infringers

764
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,440
So that's a big pain cuz that requires lawyers

765
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
Paying lawyers for their hourly

766
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Billing rates

767
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
That's super expensive I mean that must have been stressful

768
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Do that

769
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
It was really

770
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
And quite scary you know it was I'm just a frame it up know that the rule of thumb is that it takes about

771
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
50000 x 2

772
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
File path

773
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Right

774
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
But

775
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,784
The absolute minimum that one should expect when you

776
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Try to enforce it

777
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Is half a mil

778
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
That's on me

779
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
That's if you settle

780
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
Right before court we ended up

781
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,536
In our action ended up spending about two and a half million bucks

782
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
It took about three years

783
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Wow

784
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,192
It is so interesting because I suspect a lot of counterfeiters or cheaters

785
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,848
They know that an entrepreneur especially one who's not who may be doing well but not you know a billionaire

786
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
Is going to be disincentivized to fight them because the

787
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Cost

788
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,016
The legal battle is so expensive I mean

789
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,832
The lawyers fees are so high and it's

790
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Take so long that

791
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
Probably a lot of people a lot of Entrepreneurship

792
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
They just deal with it they just

793
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
They just live with all these cheap

794
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
That is exactly what happens and

795
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,400
You know a lot of times it ends up being the death knell for the innovator

796
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Because

797
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
It sucks you know I took my dog a lot

798
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
When I talked to entrepreneur groups I talked a lot about that

799
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,872
The one of the most important things in October to bring to the table

800
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
Is his or her Mojo

801
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Right

802
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,784
Danielle Wikipedia the font of all knowledge to find mojo as magical powers

803
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
I think it's it's a little more that it's that

804
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Belief in the mission

805
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
And that appreciation for

806
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Possibilities

807
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
The light just around the next corner

808
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
That is like the stuff of Aunt

809
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
The North Ship

810
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
And one of the things that happens is

811
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
You know these cheaters come in

812
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
And they create

813
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Competition

814
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Before you can really

815
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Manage

816
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
Competition or afford it

817
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
And then they

818
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
They create legal

819
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
Bees and all of that stuff is like

820
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Cuts in that bag of Mojo

821
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:22,112
And it just starts to leak out right and a lot of times it just causes entrepreneurial ultimately

822
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
To say

823
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Aquatime just worn down

824
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
You know when they walk away

825
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
What happened with the lawsuit

826
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
Eat me Father lawsuit and

827
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
3 years and what happen

828
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,312
So three years I mean it was relatively recently that we

829
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
That we got the final verdict

830
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
But we we got a unanimous

831
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
Verdict

832
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Shadow

833
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
A jury award

834
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
6.8 million in Damages which

835
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Which is quite something United

836
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Implies on us

837
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
22222

838
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
25 million in Lost sales

839
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
And

840
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
What it created was

841
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
The president

842
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Validator Lavar

843
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
Are trademarks in Arabic

844
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Marquise Patton

845
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
And

846
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
The jury verdict

847
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Ended up also

848
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
Allowing Amazon to take action

849
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
On Olive

850
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
Please in French and so

851
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
You know it's a

852
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
Very happy outcome

853
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,504
Yeah our business almost immediately

854
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,808
Left up by 40%

855
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
You're the year and sinks

856
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
To be growing

857
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Rapidly

858
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,720
I mean I know you are still at your so privately held company

859
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,584
And I've seen reports of revenues exceeding $50

860
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Maybe hire now

861
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
I'm at my right is it higher now

862
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
Will be a little north of that this year

863
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm wondering

864
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
About

865
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Your

866
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Your revenues

867
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
I mean

868
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Do you

869
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,176
Do you is it is it mainly from

870
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
The T-Rex

871
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Products or do you also

872
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
Is a revenue stream from training I mean for example if you train a personal trainer on on TRX and then that

873
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Trainer uses at

874
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
You guys aren't getting any revenue from that

875
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Trainers

876
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Work for the rest

877
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Took his or her career right

878
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
What we're not getting

879
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,472
Remedy from that individual trainers work but we are monetizing

880
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
The training

881
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Show

882
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
You know what used to be a man

883
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
In the way back

884
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
We were a hundred percent

885
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Gear right and revenue came from 100% pure sales

886
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
It's now it's

887
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
Maybe 70/30

888
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
I think

889
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,952
Pretty quickly will be 60 40 60 being gear still and

890
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
40 Bean

891
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
The soft

892
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Goods

893
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
In the form of Education revenues and then digital content so we've become

894
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
A digital content

895
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
You mean you can download videos or buy videos

896
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Things like that Iraq

897
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah through through apps in app purchase

898
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Etc

899
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
Okay here's my

900
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
Big question about

901
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Which is I've used them there

902
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
It's a really really cool it's

903
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Very simple

904
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Idea and concept

905
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
And very effective

906
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,720
But means this is still a field where Trends come and go right like there was a

907
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Timeworks

908
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Pilates is really big

909
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Barre3 in

910
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Yoga everyday things stay in Phoenix

911
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Is, things going

912
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Jazzercise

913
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
I mean is all aerobics all kind of things

914
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
What's

915
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
What's a guarantee that

916
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
People are going to want to use TRX

917
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
In 5 or 10 years

918
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
You know I think that

919
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
I'm in first wallet for a trend were fairly long-lived

920
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
Trying to display

921
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
We've been around now for

922
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
12:30

923
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Teen years

924
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Ann Arbor

925
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Growing strongly

926
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
But

927
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
I think that one of the things that

928
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Has been unique

929
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Chicabout

930
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
The company that

931
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
My team

932
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Built is that

933
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
We created

934
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Both in our hero product

935
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
I tried the T-Rex in Spanish

936
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
We became

937
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Switzerland

938
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
And by that I mean

939
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
Whatever else it is

940
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
That you do

941
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
4

942
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
Your exercise

943
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
We want to be a part of that

944
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
And we've been very successful

945
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
At

946
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
At embedding ourselves I mean just about every one of the

947
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Activities that you mentioned a minute ago

948
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
T-Rex has become part of

949
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Ready

950
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
I read I read a lot about you

951
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
People who work

952
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
What about you in

953
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
And in most all of them

954
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Hat have just like

955
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Activate your charisma

956
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
Drive your passion and

957
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Anna Marie

958
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,872
A quote that that somebody said about you it's it's a

959
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
I think it's a

960
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
Positive quotes critical role

961
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
What is positive

962
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Curious

963
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Share your reaction

964
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
This is what one of your former

965
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm in place that he said

966
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
Or she said the company's initial success

967
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
Was driven by Randy's kharisma

968
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Ego

969
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,232
In a good way people would live and die for him

970
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
But the same Charisma ego that allow the come

971
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
Grow from his garage

972
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
High-rise in downtown San

973
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Just go

974
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
Is what has gotten him into trouble

975
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Became hubristic

976
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
It's literally killing

977
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
A few years ago

978
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
You seen that cartoon shirt

979
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
What did you think when you saw that did it did it hurt you

980
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
Your feelings did you think it was

981
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Truth to it for

982
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Completely off base

983
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Well you know I think that

984
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
That I mean obviously

985
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
I'm not I'm not

986
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
I agree with

987
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,720
The quote word for word

988
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,768
I think that there's

989
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
There's probably some truth in it in that

990
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
Look when you

991
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
When you're an entrepreneur in your

992
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Trying to build something

993
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
From scratch

994
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
You got to have a ton of

995
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Efface

996
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
In your eyes

997
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
India

998
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
And you have to have be Headstrong

999
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
Because if you're not

1000
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
You won't survive

1001
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
And as you start to scale

1002
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
There's a lot of things that happened to a business

1003
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,344
And one of the things that I realized is that

1004
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Communication

1005
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Becomes really the

1006
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Hardest

1007
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Challenge 2

1008
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
To conquer

1009
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
You know your team

1010
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Grows large

1011
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,632
Yeah people scattered around various Geauga

1012
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Murphy's

1013
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
Can I synced it

1014
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
You know there are different

1015
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Levels of understanding within the Team Summit

1016
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
About what's affecting

1017
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Business

1018
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,384
And so yeah there were there was a period of time where I think we

1019
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
You know we got a little big for our britches

1020
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
And as the leader

1021
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Of the organization I'm certainly owned that

1022
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
But

1023
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,672
There is I wouldn't call it ego I would call it more

1024
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
I guess

1025
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Strength of Will Wright

1026
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Do you have a

1027
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Level of conviction

1028
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
That

1029
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
There's some significant amount of Hope bar

1030
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
And that's how you you sort of key

1031
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
You know the team focused on

1032
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
The realm of the possible and the opportunity

1033
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
It's just around the

1034
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
The next corner

1035
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
What do you think about

1036
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Where this

1037
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Companies headed and where

1038
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
And your role at I mean

1039
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
What do you think is this

1040
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,392
Going to be your life's work is this what you want to do

1041
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,976
For the rest of your life cuz you're not I mean you're an old guy when you can

1042
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
You can do something else if you want to you can

1043
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
Create something entirely new

1044
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,424
I suppose old is a relative right in the eye of the beholder right

1045
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
I mean I it's funny to be in 51

1046
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
I remember as a young seal pup

1047
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
Looking at the Admirals and thinking cat those guys are old

1048
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:14,272
And you know one of my best friends is that Admiral Tim Szymanski who now has the heads the organization down there and

1049
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
He doesn't seem old to me at all now

1050
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
But

1051
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
You know

1052
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
I

1053
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
I really love starting things

1054
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
I love that

1055
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Noriel

1056
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
Energy

1057
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm putting a team together and tackling big problems and

1058
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,424
And seeing the progress and surmounting the challenges I I love that

1059
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
And we still have plenty of that going on at

1060
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
A TRX and we aim to become the world's first great

1061
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Multi-domain training

1062
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
And nobody's ever done it

1063
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
And so I think that

1064
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
You know

1065
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
I don't

1066
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
I don't have any plans to go anywhere other than

1067
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Keep growing

1068
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Doing what we're doing

1069
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
Are you at a place now where you can kind of take a breath

1070
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
And say okay

1071
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
Forget where we

1072
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
We made it and then we're going to be just fine

1073
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,144
But not yet but I think I can see it from where I stay

1074
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,776

Craftsman

1093
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,008
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for it how you built that

1094
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Today is a better business still very early stages and it comes from Whitney Sokol

1095
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
In Boise Idaho who came up with her idea about two years ago when her son Beckham was a year old

1096
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
At that point he'd outgrown or never even got to wear around six large containers

1097
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
Worth of clothing

1098
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
And between me and the gifts that we were given I had thousands of dollars in clothing rarely

1099
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:44,288
I got one more than once or twice and sometimes not even at all

1100
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,176
Situation with a closet full of little ones

1101
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,552
And finally parents actually love the snaps because they make changing a diaper really

1102
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,392
Easy but the thing is they do not adjust

1103
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
You're growing baby you know I tried safety pins I had tried ripping out the unit elastic

1104
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,352
And rolling and unrolling

1105
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
And so the wheel started turning and I thought cash wouldn't it be just great to have one piece of cake

1106
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,336
Clothing that could fit and adjust up to 12 months

1107
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,432
So Whitney drew a sketch of what that garment could look like

1108
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
1

1109
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
Row of snaps I added an additional row so as your baby grows you forget about the first row

1110
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,720
Snapseed

1111
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
The problem was absolutely no background in design Which really hitter when

1112
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,936
When she took her design to a seamstress in Boise

1113
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,776
She starts asking me and peppering me with technical questions about

1114
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
What does Stitch will learn it

1115
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,128
What fabric weight what type of fabric

1116
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
And I just

1117
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Felt my heart

1118
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
Think a little bit I mean thinking

1119
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,807
What are you doing stay in your lane you don't sell

1120
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
To build up some confidence

1121
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Whitney enrolled in a six-month fashion program

1122
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,743
And she eventually found a seamstress to help her make a prototype

1123
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
And then polancic Kickstarter campaign she thought

1124
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,703
I'll make a video at my house with a bunch of cute babies in it the night before the kickstarter I

1125
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,751
Everything planned out

1126
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
And then the babies in the mom show up

1127
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,639
And we are having to juggle and

1128
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:31,039
Wipe tears and wipe back sides and one mom's nursing and absolute

1129
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,855

Mnsure rates $15,000 on Kickstarter

1133
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
And eventually found a factory in LA to

1134
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
Fulfill those orders

1135
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
And they

1136
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Knocked it out of the

1137
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:57,151
The park I was so impressed he was even better than I thought it would be

1138
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:03,551
