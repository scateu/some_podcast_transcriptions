Diamond Burr I'm telling my investor my heart's not in it my fault

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
Just terrible I mean this was likely be worst sort of a few weeks of my life and I remember

13
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
I was certified being myself at the up at that point in time because because I sort of kept on my side

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,032
I should have known that I was in passionate about this I should I should have known this and so much like how much money did they end up losing

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
I think they they lost the the million dollars

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
NPR how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealist

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
Behind the movement

18
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
Couchsurfing computer programmer to founding a billion dollar company

19
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
So if you ask me what it is I've learned about business from

20
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
All the entrepreneurs we've had on the show

21
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
The number one thing is

22
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
There's a problem

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
If it could be solved the world will be

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Be better off

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
And here is the proposed solution

26
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Throwing some hard work

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
And lots of luck

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Got a business

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
Which is what eventually happened to apoorva Mehta

30
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
He couldn't stand going to the grocery

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
Hated the parking lot the lines lighting the whole experience

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Is a programmer

33
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
She knew there was a

34
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Technology

35
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Who is problem

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
And the proposed solution

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
It's called instacart

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
You open the app

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Check out the grocery items you want

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
And those groceries are delivered to your front door

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
The company is now valued at more than

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
3

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Billion dollars

44
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
And it was founded barely five years ago

45
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Buy app

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
He was just

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
26 years old

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
And I'm like lots of Wonder can

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
Entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
He didn't go to Stanford or MIT

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
I actually grew up in Canada with college there

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Any studies of course

53
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Computers

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
When he graduated

55
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
The job in Seattle

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Working on

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Supply chain

58
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Amazon

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
To be honest I love that II

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Wasn't even

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
Sure why they're even paying me

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
I was having so much fun I was learning so much I

63
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Was

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Working on

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,408
Most interesting problems that I'd ever worked on so to me this was

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
But

67
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,552
After zeref about you don't want it half years I realized that

68
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,160
My learning was plateauing I wasn't really necessarily going I wasn't being challenged

69
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
It's always I sort of

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,048
Except bacton and reflected on what I wanted to do

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
I realize that it wasn't

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,680
Play a different role or a different company would change that

73
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
It was that

74
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
What would be fulfilling for me is

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,408
To make a material difference in this world and I wouldn't be able to do that working in a in a in a bigger company

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
And so

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
One of the ways that I thought that would be

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,368
It would allow me to make it at Material differences is to be an entrepreneur and

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
I

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Thought that

81
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
Being an entrepreneur will be cool and but I know anything about it

82
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
I'm so

83
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
I

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Started to go to these

85
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Tech meetups in Seattle

86
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
And

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
I remember the first one that I went to

88
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
They had invited a bunch of these

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Tech luminaries

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
To the meet-up to speak to us

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Who is there it was Gordon Bing

92
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Or so I think it's been going

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,064
He wasn't executive from Electronic Arts EA which is a

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
Really big game company and

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
I members are listening to this talk and

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
They could have been.

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Talking in Hebrew

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
But you had no idea what he was.

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
I had absolutely zero idea

100
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
They were talking about things like

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Enterprise.

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
To me if you're talking about an Enterprise startup

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
It meant like

104
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
You're talking about the car rental

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
And told me

106
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
Since you were a computer geek you did not understand the language of business

107
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
At all

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,599
But I liked it so I threw thought that I was going the right direction

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
And then I realized that work was getting in the way

110
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
And the the fact that

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,839
I would come up with all these ideas that I would want to build into companies

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
And I wasn't able to

113
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
Put my full attention to those because

114
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
I was going to work

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
You are still at Amazon

116
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Yeah and

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Tumi

118
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
The way to do this

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
Fully was to actually quit my job

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
In a couple weeks after that I decide to quit

121
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
I didn't

122
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Have a clue what my startup was going to do

123
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
But I knew that I wanted to do this in Seoul

124
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Did you leave Seattle FF

125
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Yes as I read more and more about Entre

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
Urban Airship in as I started to

127
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
Find all these people like that that I would be able to talk to or service

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Prolific entrepreneurs in

129
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Investors

130
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Datejust had something

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
In common which was that all of them

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Where in Silicon Valley

133
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
To me it was like

134
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
If you're acting you're probably good idea for you to be in Hollywood and so

135
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
It wasn't like I was you know I had a job to do so

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Oh you know why not move to San Francisco

137
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
Pantene a picture for my where you like

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,279
Did you get an apartment in San Francisco and you had like at your computer there and

139
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,655
You just tinkering on it all day or were you meeting with people and cuz I'm assuming you

140
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,471
I didn't know that many people there did you

141
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
When I move to San Francisco I only knew one guy here and

142
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,919
Lucky for me he also had a couch and so that's where I was

143
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
I would never sleep on the couch and wake up in

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Start

145
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Anchoring in

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,903
The right code for the new idea that I was working on

147
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
That was pretty much my life

148
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
For the next two years

149
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
And when you said running Cody you were writing at that point

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
App Store redeem code

151
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
For websites

152
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
Both whatever the the idea require

153
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
For example one of the ideas that I was working on was

154
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
It was this thing called office hours

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
And this would allow

156
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Anyone

157
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
To connect with tech luminaries or luminaries in general in

158
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,783
It would be like a one-on-one session with someone for 30 minutes or an hour

159
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
And

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,695
That was a website that was a nap and what happened to cool

161
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
Yeah so turns out that you really can't

162
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Get that many

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Current Tech luminaries to spend

164
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
Enough of a time on this platform

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Because they're all busy

166
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
And so it didn't work

167
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
So

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
All the all the while you're

169
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Living with a friend

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
And

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
You don't have to pay a coder because you're doing all the back end

172
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Technology right

173
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
That's right

174
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Super exciting are you having

175
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,975
It started off being really interesting and fun because I was learning a lot of these interesting things like how to

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
What business models work

177
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,607
And what don't what how to build a prototype really really fast

178
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
How to advertise

179
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
But then

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
After going through all these ideas I

181
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
I was getting pretty tired I was getting tired of sore feeling

182
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
This was a pretty low point in my in my life

183
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,455
When I was like all I might even cut out to be an entrepreneur at all then

184
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
You know I remember there's one idea.

185
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
It's something that it had been

186
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
I my mind and I thought

187
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
That this ideas

188
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
This is brilliant this is going to be the one that

189
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
It is a home run

190
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
You know it's going to be awesome

191
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
The idea was

192
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
A social network

193
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
For lawyers

194
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,311
You clearly don't know many lawyers they do not tend to be social that is

195
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Something I overlooked

196
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
What Jetty behind it

197
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Was like assertive

198
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
LinkedIn

199
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
Yeah so the idea was that LinkedIn was just

200
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
To generic and it was not for everyone

201
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
But if there were specific features that were billed for lawyers

202
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,399
Then it would be useful to them and they would be willing to do use this product

203
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,751
And if they were willing to use this product maybe there are ways to monitor

204
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
His well until you have this idea

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
And in what

206
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
You ran with

207
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,503
Yeah in fat guy you've been raised about $1000000 and financing

208
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
But I realized very quickly that

209
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
That as soon as I went home after work

210
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Stop thinking about work

211
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,535
I stopped thinking about Lord I didn't care about lawyer that I don't care about what they did on their

212
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
I need a life is just didn't matter to me

213
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
You know after about

214
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
About a year of doing this

215
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
I just realized that I

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
I was going in the wrong direction

217
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Just wasn't going to work

218
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
And what's the company was a concept

219
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
Proving to be successful in any way or was it

220
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
It seemed pretty clear that

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
I think that

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
It could have worked but

223
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
What I've been doing

224
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,207
So far and as my my journey as an entrepreneur was

225
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
That I had been looking for good encoding code business ideas

226
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
And they were not necessarily

227
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Business ideas that I cared about they were just

228
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Business ID

229
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Windsurf that's when I realize that

230
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,407
The odds of success in a startup or solo anyways her have to go

231
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
You have to put

232
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,575
Everything that you have it in it you just can't do that for an idea that you just don't care about 4

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
And then that's when I said that I I just can't do this and

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
I quit my own startup

235
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
What is

236
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Remember like

237
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
What were you told your

238
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah my

239
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
I remember

240
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Telling my investors

241
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
The same thing which is that my heart's not in it

242
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
IPhone

243
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
Just terrible I mean this was likely the worst sort of

244
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
A few weeks of my life

245
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
Yeah I remember having to

246
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Alvin look I

247
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
I'll do what

248
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
You think is best

249
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
If you want we can

250
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Return the money

251
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
The good thing

252
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Here was that

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
These guys were very experienced

254
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Investors in

255
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Did

256
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,839
Seen this happened before and then you that

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
It was the right thing to do for the company and it was the right thing to do for me

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
And they were extremely supportive during

259
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
So

260
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
How much like how much money did they end up losing

261
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
I think they they lost the the million dollars wow

262
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm swimming

263
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Yeah I mean I think there is a

264
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Feeling that

265
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,623
I should have known this I should have known that this

266
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Was not going to work I should have known better

267
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
And if this is a certified continuous feeling that happens to me and I think that I was sort of being myself

268
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
At that point in time because because I

269
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,519
I should have kept telling myself I should have known that I was in passionate about this I should I should have known this and

270
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Yeah yeah yeah

271
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Games perspective I was

272
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,223
Take me to I'm not American and so I didn't have

273
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Any income and I was in the in a country where I

274
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,623
I only had a limited amount of time that I could really be here

275
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Because I am an immigrant

276
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
And sew in

277
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
You know during this time my

278
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,095
Mom also was was going through some health issues as well and

279
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
This is just build the worst time in my life I remember

280
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
So many nights when I was just

281
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Wake up and cry because there's nothing else like

282
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,175
Are you able to turn around I mean it's it's hard to

283
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
Pinpoint one sort of single at the moment but it was feeling in my mind that

284
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
It had been developing go over the

285
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
The whole entire year which was that I should be doing something that I care about I should be doing something that I'm passionate about huh

286
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Event turned out to be

287
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Something that was her

288
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,935
Pretty close to home and that was the fact that

289
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,287
Ever since I can remember you from childhood memories and talk

290
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
I had always hated

291
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Every aspect of grocery

292
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
Going around around in the aisles in a grocery

293
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
East Aurora

294
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Waiting in line at the checkout or

295
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
And in some cases you know frankly in memories of

296
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,511
Being in Canada and waiting for the bus with all the bags in your hands in your

297
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Your fingers are just

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Freezing in the cold

299
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
You know everything about it

300
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Demi was just

301
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Painful

302
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
And

303
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
The last

304
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
2 years of my life I just worked on building

305
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Oldies cool apps in products and so on

306
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Then I realized that

307
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
I did everything online

308
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
I didn't

309
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Bought stuff online

310
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Book bookstore

311
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
Whatever and I met people online

312
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
I want

313
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
TV online I was doing everything online

314
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,535
But the one activity that I've always hated in my entire life

315
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
I was still doing

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
In the most inefficient way pause

317
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Tumi

318
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,823
That was a problem that I cared about that was a problem that I was so passionate about

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
That I

320
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
How how long did

321
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Did it take you to go from that

322
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759

What's today's weather

328
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Months of being depressed or

329
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Or longer

330
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
It was a few weeks and I remembered it this is

331
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
This is really interesting because

332
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,263
They were weeks where I was so depressed at the lowest point in my life

333
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
And as soon as I started thinking about this idea

334
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
I was in

335
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383

Apoorva Mehta has just come up with the idea

371
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Idea for a grocery delivery app

372
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Are you sure it's going to become huge

373
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
But at this point

374
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
The company

375
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Is just

376
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Apoorva

377
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
The first version of the app I

378
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Found that there was a

379
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Website

380
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
Called safeway.com

381
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Grocery store in

382
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
I

383
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,695
Saw that they had all their their inventory available online and so

384
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
I just scraped it and

385
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,375
I was like great I have all the items that I am going to have in the first version of the app

386
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,983
Until I can get over there over the next few weeks I I built the app and I

387
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Place the first order

388
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
But because

389
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
I was the only person

390
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Company at the

391
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
This time I

392
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
I placed an order and then I

393
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
To the grocery store pick the order in

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Delivered to myself

395
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
So was the whole

396
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
Contact already mapped out by that point

397
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,767
Yeah that idea was that we would connect to all the people who wanted to get their groceries delivered with all the people who

398
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
I want to earn money while picking and delivering groceries

399
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
You know I started to

400
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
You sharing this with it with my friends

401
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
And it was really interesting because

402
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,639
You know before instacart I would share products with my friends and

403
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Use it out of guilt

404
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
It was just

405
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
Oh yeah we want to

406
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Help for buyout

407
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
But this one was different

408
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
It was

409
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Very clear that

410
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
The people wanted to use

411
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
It was really cool because

412
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
And then the first version of the app

413
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
Anytime anyone would place an order

414
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
I would get a text

415
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,167
And every time I would get a text I would look at it and say ho

416
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Let's see who placed an order

417
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Enzo for the first

418
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,847
Few days for few weeks I I just saw my friends using that on a regular basis

419
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Really cool

420
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
And then I saw people who are using the app

421
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Why didn't even know

422
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,599
And so what happened was that my friends were sharing the app with their friends

423
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,231
This word of mouth was starting and people were telling each other about pay you can get your groceries delivered

424
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
And so that's when I realized

425
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,655
That I needed more people to pick and deliver the groceries was it called instacart

426
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
At this point I already beginning

427
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,799
Yeah the name was calling because I didn't have the domain name

428
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
At the time so

429
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,175
It was called get instacart.com was where you would find that yeah

430
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
And to me the idea was that

431
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Customers

432
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
You should expect instant gratification

433
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
And anything less than that

434
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,767
Would essentially mean that there was just another barrier in the customer

435
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
And there were there R&B

436
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
The time that were other

437
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
Delivery services right like a Peapod and

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Amazon

439
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Even had had one and two

440
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Still has one.

441
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
Fresh Direct in others

442
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
But I guess they're their models were complete

443
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Different

444
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,503
Presumably because they were actually they had inventory you did not have any inventory

445
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Yeah I realized

446
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
Even from day one against

447
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Instacart the our biggest competitor

448
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Was going to be a man

449
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Your former employer

450
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
That's right and

451
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
I realize in order to survive

452
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
Really compete with them

453
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
I would have to do something that's meaningful you different

454
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Front end

455
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,079
It couldn't be something that was just it was like cheaper or anything like that because Amazon has gobs and gobs of money so it wasn't

456
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
It wasn't that

457
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
It just had to be something that

458
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
They just want to be able to do and it turns out there are a lot of retailers across the country where

459
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
I really want to shop from people getting there

460
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
Their favorite types of groceries from

461
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
And they don't like Amazon

462
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
And so to me it was

463
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
The ability to serve build something

464
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Weather for the Retailer's

465
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
To be able to compete with Amazon

466
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,543
What is the weight of go in what that would allow other the customers to do is

467
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Get their groceries from their favorite grocery stores

468
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,967
And get a much better selection then you would be able to get on Amazon just because

469
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,295
Every single grocery store is on this platform until you have just

470
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Any more items in a different types of items

471
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Then you will be able to get on Amazon

472
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Chip from the time that you built this and 30

473
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Hestia

474
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Time to the time when you thought all right

475
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
I better go out in like

476
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Get some money

477
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Scaleless how how long was it

478
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Few months

479
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Yeah I think it was just

480
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
2

481
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Two and a half months

482
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Hand

483
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
I mean it was it was becoming pretty clear because I was just too hiring all these people would my very limited

484
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Money and

485
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
My bank balance at a time

486
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Actually hitting zero

487
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
I knew that was

488
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Good and how are you finding how are you finding p

489
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
People to hire get music

490
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Personal shopper

491
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
That would do the grocery shopping how are you able to

492
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Define the people

493
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
What first it was just Craigslist I really I have just posted an ad in and get a bunch of people to to enter

494
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
View Inn

495
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
Remember the first guy who hired as a shopper

496
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
He was wearing a suit and a tie for

497
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
I was like

498
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
This is a

499
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,135
Job for picking and delivering groceries but if he's wearing a suit and tie better hire

500
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
And so that's what I did

501
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
How are you able to make sure that the shoppers

502
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
So you are hiring where are you know

503
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Anniston

504
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
Reading and all that stuff right it wasn't easy

505
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
That we had lots of interesting

506
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Experiences there where

507
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
In the early days of

508
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
Instacart one of the ways that

509
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,176
Shoppers with checkout at the grocery store when they would

510
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
They had bought the groceries for someone else

511
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Is by using gift cards

512
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,672
So you know you have to trust them gift cards

513
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
A prepaid credit card that's right that turns out to be great for a lot of people most people are pretty trustworthy but

514
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
For some people if they were just buying their own groceries with it

515
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,288
What would happen if the store was

516
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
What kind of avocados are some

517
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Yapko freak

518
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Example

519
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
If you

520
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Don't have

521
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
The Heinz Ketchup that you ordered

522
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
How do you make a substitution for

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
We realize that we would have to make

524
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
The app

525
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184
Pretty smart because they would have to understand

526
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,512
Apus items out of stock what should I do to replace this with

527
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
The cost around the same

528
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
But if something to the customer will be happy with

529
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
Excessive what happened to Shepard

530
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
Call the customer said hey they don't know how to catch up with you got Hans

531
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Do you want that

532
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Yasso initially

533
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
We

534
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Tried would not climb

535
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
Hey customer

536
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Probably fine

537
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Find Esprit intrusive

538
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
But then we realize that no

539
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Actually customers

540
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Love it when guy when are Shoppers call to customers

541
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Because they feel so special there like

542
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Why can't you have this person actually

543
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
Looking out for me when that papaya has gone bad

544
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
The The Shopper will call the customer and say Hey you know

545
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
I could get you this papaya but it's not the best quality

546
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
Right in the end. That's a very

547
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Their intimate experience

548
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Yeah

549
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
We

550
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
You know we we in cursive

551
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
How much money at the beginning to the

552
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Take

553
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
2

554
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
Dictate keep us going before you had any outside money

555
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:26,208
I think it just took a few thousand dollars because you know you're paying all these Shoppers and you have to pay

556
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Pay them with the hours that they work

557
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
In the money that

558
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,144
And the customers would pay would show up a few days after into there times where

559
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
I would just not have any money

560
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
They say it was very clear

561
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
So how'd you added you find investors

562
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,688
I realized you know from sort of going through the start-up ideas that I hadn't

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Which was that

564
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
Who you raising money from the quality of investors was really important so

565
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Tumi

566
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
The way that I would be able to attract Saint the best investors in

567
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
Silicon Valley was

568
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
If I went to an incubator

569
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Like y combinator

570
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Saudi incubator

571
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Insult

572
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
There's only one problem with

573
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
That was that

574
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
You know I had missed the application deadline

575
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
2 months

576
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
Which meant that what you have to wait another year basic

577
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
That's right

578
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
And

579
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Time to wait

580
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
I

581
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
Stats on people that I met into

582
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Disco

583
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
To connect me with the

584
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Partners in in y combinator

585
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,952
And then finally I got one response

586
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
When it was

587
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,560
Garry Tan one of the partners at y combinator he said

588
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Look at

589
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Likely not going to work but you can

590
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
You can fill out a late application

591
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,800
So I filled out a late application and then finally I got a response room and he says

592
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Nope

593
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
MassLive

594
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
This sucks

595
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
As the Koran is like

596
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,344
This guy does this even know what instacart is has even tried out the product does even know

597
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Wife different

598
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
And so what I did was

599
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:06,304
Open the app I ordered a six-pack of beer and addressed it in for the Y combinator head

600
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,400
And half an hour later I got a call from Gary Tammy is like

601
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
What is this

602
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,544
Sounds like oldest thing to cart and I guess the beer must have been pretty good because

603
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
He asked me to come in then the next day for an interview

604
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
And so I

605
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
Job interview the next day and then soon after that it was accepted

606
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
So that's how

607
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
Oyster card got funded

608
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
And that the business model was based on the idea that

609
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
It would be a delivery fee

610
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
Plus IV

611
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Obviously 8

612
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Epremium like

613
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
Pants slightly higher price

614
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
4

615
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
A product

616
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Then you would if you had

617
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
What's the storm body

618
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,752
That's right early on because we don't have any retail relationship

619
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
We would have to mark up the items

620
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
And

621
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Divya small delivery

622
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Caswell

623
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
We didn't know you know

624
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
Keep customers would actually want to pay that and

625
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
Turns out there a lot of customers who are okay with that

626
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,088
But then we realize that if we partnered with the

627
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
The grocery stores

628
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
We could really

629
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Reduce

630
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Supreme your arm make it to be frankly

631
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
The same price as a store

632
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
And that

633
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
Dramatically changed the way

634
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
That people interact

635
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
So when you say partner I mean

636
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
You able to reduce the cost of

637
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
The groceries

638
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Because the supermarket

639
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Partnered with Dashie

640
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
He paid you guys to do that service on their behalf

641
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
That's right so today

642
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
Hundreds of retailers across the country pay us

643
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Affiliated

644
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
To be honest

645
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
And I guess

646
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
The question is why wouldn't a big

647
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Grocery

648
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Like I know you do a lot of Whole Foods

649
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
Camp like why wouldn't they just make their own instacart

650
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Is it just is it

651
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
Cheaper to work and more efficient to work with

652
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
A company like yours that already exists and has the infrastructure

653
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
Boat so it's definitely cheaper because that mean you know we

654
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Have

655
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Aldi's grocery store has already work with us and so

656
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Definitely that but

657
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
I think the main reason is that

658
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,136
That we are technology company and

659
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Allowed the grocery stores are

660
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Very good at

661
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,560
Managing grocery stores managing the inventory in the grocery stores

662
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Managing how to produce

663
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,656
Is this place fresh and Salon

664
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
What they're not very good at is

665
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
Solving technical problems

666
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,872
I like some of the problems that freaking if I was working on it Amazon so the logistical issues

667
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
How do you make sure that

668
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
Did the Shoppers when they're picking the groceries in the store

669
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
They are doing that in the most efficient way possible

670
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,880
We know where the items are already located we map them in many key

671
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Do those types of things

672
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Are things that are soft

673
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
I had a software company would be able to do in

674
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
That and I'm not necessarily a grocery store

675
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
I will be able to

676
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
I mean in those

677
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
First two years

678
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,384
We're investors like beating down your door to the best of us as people started to download the app and use it

679
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
You know I wish that was the case

680
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
It you know it was it was

681
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
Pretty hard to be honest I think that

682
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
Early on

683
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Wasn't very obvious

684
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Did most people that

685
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
This

686
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Become something and

687
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:22,400
Because there had been other ideas like this before like webvan back in the day

688
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
During the.com era

689
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,264
And that was one of the biggest failures of all time

690
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,616
Like it literally lost billions of dollars I remember one time I was

691
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Pitching a venture capitalist

692
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,248
You know we were in the conference room and then he suddenly

693
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
Gets up and he leaves the meeting

694
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
Confuse I was like why was in the middle of the presentation

695
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
He came back with a floppy disk

696
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Easter slams it on the on the table

697
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
And you like

698
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
Go home and study what's

699
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Inside the five

700
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
Because it has the webvan business model

701
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Until you need to understand that I really well and why didn't work

702
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
How's life

703
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
This guy is just so smart and

704
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
Well-known

705
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
A person in Silicon Valley and

706
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
Like I must

707
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
Be completely wrong

708
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,368
But thankfully I guess I didn't have a way to open the floppy disk is it just have floppy drive but

709
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
So I never really looked at that the business plan their butt

710
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
You know it was just

711
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
It was

712
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
If there's a lot of self-doubt

713
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
Haven't you ever cut myself. How did you know that

714
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Or did you just kind of

715
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Live with it

716
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,592
I think at least me I've just gone through these

717
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
Roller coasters of emotions

718
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Every single day

719
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
You know there's

720
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Wishing you were here

721
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Some

722
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
Master telling you something like that were

723
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
They completely rule out your ideas on asking to work or

724
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
Someone in the process something

725
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,048
The other times you're growing really fast in customers love your product

726
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
The right into me it was just

727
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
That I just felt like this

728
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,496
Should exist I was really solving a problem that

729
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
You know I wanted to solve in

730
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
So I was okay with going through a lot of

731
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Just

732
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
Terrible times to make this a reality

733
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,760
Yeah I wonder how you how you deal with a the roller coaster

734
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Xtratuf even

735
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
I write because

736
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Of course is always going to be criticized

737
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Always gonna be people who

738
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
Lesson plans for me how do you

739
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,280
How do you manage quality how do you maintain in a

740
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
A quality of service

741
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Cross

742
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
7th place

743
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Yeah I'll

744
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
Start with saying that we're learning

745
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
And we have a long long way to

746
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
And we go

747
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Went from

748
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
Having zero Choppers

749
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Having tens of thousands

750
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
People on earth

751
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
Platform I really really quickly inside out

752
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
I don't think we're doing it

753
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
We've had

754
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
Luck so far in

755
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,416
Building a very strong culture and

756
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,976
The teams in the store have

757
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,048
My metrics that they are assigned in terms of

758
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,632
A fast they're picking what is the quality of their ear picking how

759
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
How how many

760
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
Good replacements are they making it

761
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
They're sort of all working towards a common goal

762
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
And I think it. Has helped

763
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
Build that camaraderie in the culture that I truly care about

764
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
What what what

765
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Keeps you up at night like like

766
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,552
Drones delivering groceries to people and or

767
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Like what is it that you were your words

768
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Could could like knock you guys off

769
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
I think that

770
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
It really is just

771
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Our

772
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Lack of execution

773
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,096
That I think will be the cause of our failure if

774
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
That's what keeps me up at night is

775
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
It's little things like

776
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
Add small element of a meeting

777
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm just did not go well or

778
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
Project is not going well even though it may not be the most important project

779
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
But to me that's a sign that

780
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
They were not doing their job well overall in

781
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,416
The Transformers 2 two other important things in so to me I think

782
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
It's making sure that that the

783
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
The team is working on

784
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,608
All the little details and then they're paying attention to the details and doing a great job

785
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
Is very important at night when I'm done. Doesn't

786
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Every stressed out

787
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
At and how many how many

788
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
People work

789
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Directly for insta

790
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
We have

791
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664

792
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
3000 employees

793

Islands

794
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Easter cards

795
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
And we have

796
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808

Contractors

799
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Why The Purge

800
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
That's right

801
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Started this

802
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
5 years ago

803
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
Depression or funk

804
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
After failing

805
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Billion dollar Gamble

806
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Nuts

807
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
Yeah I mean

808
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
I'm in I'm so lucky

809
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
To be

810
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
Where I am

811
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Today

812
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
You know being

813
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Surrounded by some

814
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
People who work

815
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Very hard

816
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
It just really really lucky

817
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
I mean obviously

818
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
Super smart guy in you worked really really hard but

819
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Is that do you think that luck is is a bigger part of it

820
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Oh I think luck is majority

821
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
I mean you know there's so many elements of lucke-zone

822
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Times when luck

823
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
I play the part but

824
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
I think it's

825
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
Specifically true in startups because

826
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,848
It didn't start out so you have is this moment in time when

827
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Companies

828
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
Anything before that

829
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,968
It's too early anything after that it's way too late

830
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
And there's too much

831
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,880
The timing being there at the right place at the right time is everything

832
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:37,280
Apoorva Mehta founder of instacart a company as we met

A rich young man on Forbes list of the richest people under 40

835
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,664
Apoorva comes in at number 3100 and is late night instacart order

836
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
The perfect oldest it's ice cream cheese crackers and figs

837
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
Please don't turn it off just yet in a moment

838
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
We're going to hear from you about the things

839
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424

TIAA believes

Smart Financial

846
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Conversations should enable life not

847
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Define it

848
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,296
Because real success isn't just measured in zeros

849
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,368

Connecting with family

851
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952

TIAA

858
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

859
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Time now for Howard

860
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:57,152
You built that and I can tell you when we heard about this next product

861
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
At first we thought

862
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
A joke

863
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Because well I'm glad we called it the inventor Tim casa

864
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,928
Have there been people ever into you at the end of invest like what were you thinking this is crazy

865
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
It's anytime

866
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,912
Something comes in and disrupt an existing Market

867
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,032
And the backlash is coming from some of the most opinionated people on earth

868
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Parents

869
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
But before I tell you what's going on

870
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,736
2 about a year-and-a-half ago Tim became apparent himself when his son jack was

871
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
So I was literally feeding my child every hour for 20 minutes

872
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,416
Set a time is a great bonding time

873
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
You know there's a lot of interaction

874
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
During the day

875
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
But there's also a lot of feeding times at midnight

876
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
Do you know where

877
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
The child is basically asleep

878
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
Entering those moments

879
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
You could of course be

880
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
Getting stuff done accomplishing important tasks

881
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
So that's when the idea came to me that I think I can solve the problem and make a device that connects your smart

882
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,040
Turn to your baby bottle and give you the opportunity to

883
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:13,440
Multitask when you never thought possible yes a problem that many parents did not know needed solving

884
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
And Tim solution

885
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:19,584
A plastic device that clamps around a baby bottle with an arm that

886
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Clamps onto your smartphone

887
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,264
You hold the baby in one arm with clamp holds the bottle at a perfect 45 degree angle

888
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
And with your free hand you can just

889
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
The scroll and swipe to your heart's content there's no harm in when your kid is half asleep and just maybe

890
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Being able to catch up on some

891
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
Read an NPR article or right now play Candy Crush

892
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:50,048
Parents are already using their phones while bottle feeding or just providing a more secure method of doing it Tim has the perfect

893
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
Name for this device because of the swipe and feed

894
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,264
And every head that lightbulb moment give me the first one for himself in his basement. Some actual

895
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
And

896
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
Layered a bunch of pieces

897
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,432
Tim made a mold out of the tin foil heat flatten it out of plastic

898
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,832
And then use the heat gun to bend the whole thing into the right shape and I made my first very rough prototype

899
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,648
Kept making this prototypes were probably the first couple months

900
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
And just talking to people

901
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
Especially parents

902
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:24,864
And you're after some parents. This is definitely something that they would buy I thought we should I sell

903
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
So Tim started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $13,000 enough to pay for his first batch of in

904
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,664
Inventory and he eventually found two manufacturers wanted Michigan the other in North Carolina to make

905
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
Take the plastic and silicone parts of the swipe and feed and then he assembles them right there in his house

906
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,392
So I get boxes and boxes of plastics

907
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
Pieces that are assembled and finalized in my basement

908
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,096
And I'm shipping from the same desk and I'm talking to you from right now in my basement in Reston Virginia

909
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,216
Since January Tim sold almost a thousand of these things but for now

910
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
He's keeping his day job

911
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:09,152
As a corporate recruiter what I love for this to be my full-time job or do I think it could be like asking some

912
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,272
I'm sure you know this this could be a great day

913
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
Okay but back to the backlash part parenting blogs have been lighting up and some parents say the swipe and feed

914
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,000
Utterly destroy the parents baby bond for apps

915
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,584
You can bring an end to civilization as we know it

916
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
The Kim

917
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
He's optimistic

918
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,728
Spend all your time focusing on the people who just

919
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,104
You know are there to try and bring you down then you never look for you never get anything

920
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
