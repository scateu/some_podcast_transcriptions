Of NPR

00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:29,440

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
We wanted to tell it to you

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000

I literally in like a hundred square foot Office Space

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
And so when we needed a second line we got a second phone so that I do remember times I feel like sitting on the floor in the off

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,576
Office literally like toggling between two physical phones with no home button

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744

Tow company that brings in 350 million

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Here

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
Show in summer of 1995

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,744
Angie Hicks at just graduated from college in Indiana with

22
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Is where she's from

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,120
And like a lot of college graduates she was looking for a job

24
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,984
The previous Summer She interned at a small Venture Capital firm in Indianapolis

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
Airbus there was a man named Bill OST

26
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Bill Withers

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
Just a few years older than Andy but

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
He already had a lot of business expo

29
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
So they kept in touch

30
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
And with Angie job-hunting

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
Collegeville was giving her advice about

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Where to apply

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Hiring that kind of thing

34
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,048
I was back in the day where you would literally send your resume and cover letter by mail so I sent out

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
Numerous letters and resumes

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
And then calls me up one day and says

37
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Hey Angie I have an idea

38
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,312
At that point he had moved to do Columbus Ohio

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Is it like why don't you move to Columbus and we can start a business all raise a little bit of money

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
Money from your friends and enough to to get you through the first year

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
I want you to commit for a year

42
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
So what so what you think

43
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,744
It was a little out of the blue and I would never have defied myself

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
As an entrepreneur

45
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:47,680
A lot of times when I thought of classical entrepreneurs I would like a they're risk-takers their big idea thinkers

46
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
That

47
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
So

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
Ring my hands about that decision and

49
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Talk to my parents about it and

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
Well you know you don't feel well you know he's not going to lead you astray

51
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
And then I talked to my grandfather and he was incredibly conservative I lived through the depression

52
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
I'm just me.

53
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Like to pay cash for everything

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
Yeah he looked at me without even hesitating and was like

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Will you you should do it in G

56
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
I mean what's the difference between being

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
22 and looking for a job and being 23 and looking for a job

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
I was like

59
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
So

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Literally like

61
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Loaded up all of my worldly possessions in my 40s

62
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Escort in office

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
So at that point did Bill actually have

64
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
A business in mind or was he just like hey come to Columbus and then we'll figure it out

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
We have a couple ideas

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
But then

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
Landed on what became Angie's List when

68
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Bill was trying to renovate his house in Colombo

69
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
It was a second house you don't

70
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
This house in Indianapolis is also a fixer-upper but in Indianapolis he was introduced to a little business called

71
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Unified Neighbors

72
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Cars that have been around since

73
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Since the early 70s

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Which was basically a list of who was good and he wasn't in the city

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
For Home Improvement

76
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
So what do you move to Columbus he just kind of assumed there was something like that in every city

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
And so

78
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,440
He's like we're going to try to start our own okay so this is like like 95

79
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
That's right

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,791
So you get to Columbus what did you do there like how did you

81
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
You start

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
We started just talking to people that we knew so you're the first stop on my light or was two bills next

83
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Door neighbor

84
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
Patty did you say it was your pet

85
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,431
We're starting this business

86
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
People find the best contractors in town

87
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,391
And Patty had lived in her house lived in her neighborhood for entire life

88
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,767
You know someone did not need what we were selling it was probably Patty

89
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,167
But Patty love the entrepreneurial Spirit of it so she looked at me and she was like this is great

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
I'm going to take two member

91
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
One for me

92
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
And one for my son

93
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
Give me a list of every service provider should ever used

94
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
And she also gave me

95
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
Her church Direct

96
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,879
She told me that I had to call everybody at her church directory and tell them that

97
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
She said they should buy it

98
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
And how much was a membership at that time

99
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
$19 for the year

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
We are magazine in a concert

101
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,471
So during the day when you could ask me for the name of a plumber and electrician and then the

102
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
In the evening I would go out door-to-door

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
And also ask

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
4 reviews

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,711
So you did everything you you wrote I wrote the magazine

106
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Like magazine is a very

107
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Generous

108
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,623
Term for brochure issue

109
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
So how did you

110
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
How did you get more subscribers

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
I literally for the first three or four months I've been

112
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Basically went door-to-door every

113
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
What was that like

114
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
Remember I'm an introvert

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,287
It was probably one of the most miserable experiences you miserable because

116
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
You just weren't getting a traction like Hugo

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Door-to-door people would just say

118
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
Play buzz off for tonight in the mid-90s

119
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
I got now I like to look back on it

120
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
Experiencing

121
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Yeah it was hard

122
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
There was a moment in the

123
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,327
The fall and he has like you think about like I was 22 and I kind of realize that this is my life

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,935
This is my career really didn't need to go to college to do what I was doing

125
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Did you know anybody in Columbus

126
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Bill and his wife

127
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
So you were just like

128
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
On your own in Mississippi

129
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Just working all the time

130
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Going door-to-door

131
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
As an introvert

132
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
You are totally miserable

133
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Ava love one day

134
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
And I appreciate the fact that he realized

135
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
But I was upset

136
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
Siri suggest that we meet like it's a little Bakery down

137
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Until we get there

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
Soon as I sit down I just start crying

139
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
He just starts talking

140
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Annie's just like

141
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,615
Selling me on why we were it was going to be great and you know he talked for probably another 30 minutes

142
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
And everyone in the fake real looking at us like what is wrong

143
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,319
And I'm in he likes to tell the story that like at the end

144
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
All I could muster to say was that I was not going to quit

145
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Soap so what happened after that conversation is did you just go back out on the streets and start

146
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,727
Selling door-to-door

147
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Success by

148
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
One or two membership

149
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
If I sold two memberships a day it was

150
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,455
Fast forward a little bit in real life k

151
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
This is probably not the marketing plan

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,855
And it's going to work so then we're going to have to raise

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
Insane amounts of money was like $50,000

154
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:03,583
And so you know where can we Market that we can do it in an economical way that we won't burn through $50,000 real

155
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
So we

156
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,007
We lucked out in Columbus Ohio has at that time had these little Weekly News

157
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
And so

158
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
So we put an ad in the back of the weekly newspaper and it was

159
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Listen your neighborhood by neighborhood

160
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
And

161
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,527
It was this little too by 3 ad that said tired of lousy service

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
So are we

163
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
So we decided to do something

164
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
And people started calling you

165
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
And you are the only person Manning the phones

166
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
I literally in like a hundred square foot office space that the people in the other

167
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
Offices around me thought my parents rented

168
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
For me to do my homework

169
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Working at a card table

170
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
Turn off phone system we had a phone

171
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
And so when we needed the second line we got a second phone

172
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
I do remember times I be like sitting on the floor in the office literally like

173
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
Toggling between two physical phones with no hold

174
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
And what people like your subscribers are just call up during the day and then say hey I need a plumber or like a roofer and you would say yeah yeah yeah

175
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,303
Yeah it's like or if I didn't have an answer given the list was then I would go for

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Figure it out I remember one time

177
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
This woman called

178
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
She was new in town and wanted

179
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
To sign her daughter up for ballet

180
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
I'm so

181
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
So it's like hang on

182
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,223
Luckily I remembered cuz I signed up all the members that I had a member who was apart of the Columbus ballet

183
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
So I call her up

184
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Ballet lessons

185
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
So yeah we're I would just

186
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
It's kind of try to make

187
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
You were you are like a human however I cut you were a human Google

188
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,631
Yes you were the like the person like when you type it into Google you were the person the other side

189
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Answering that question

190
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
And what was the company

191
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Call by the way

192
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh sure it was called Columbus neighbor

193
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
So you don't got to decide

194
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
A simple knock off of the unified Neighbors

195
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
Yeah we debated names

196
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
One of the guys that was involved with puppies on them

197
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
The board he was like what's called the list

198
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
And you know like it's pretty good name by the way

199
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Let's forget.

200
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Yeah maybe heart attack

201
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
And then Bill throws any like what we could just name it

202
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Angie's List

203
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Since

204
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Angie's who you talk to and

205
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
It does make a good story and

206
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
No matter what happens

207
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,615
I can always relate back to you know Angie was the first one that answered the phone

208
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
So you know

209
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
Probably not knowing what I was getting into

210
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
That was a decision we made

211
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
So when you ran these ads

212
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
And you started to see more subscribers

213
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
How long does it take before you start thinking

214
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
Is actually working with sexy generating some cash for the

215
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
We ended up signing of a thousand members in the first year

216
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Azurite

217
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
This could be with this could be a go at it so then we started thinking like maybe we should go and see if we can acquire unified name

218
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Savers in

219
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Right right

220
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
So

221
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,759
We ended up accomplishing it about a year after we started income

222
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
So then yeah I kind of wake up one day in July

223
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
1990

224
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
36 +

225
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
I've got

226
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Two offices so I had to

227
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Start advertising to hire some

228
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Some help

229
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
I'm 22 I don't know how to hire anyone

230
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
So I placed a little ad in our newsletter

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Hire people

232
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
And I have this one woman that came in her name

233
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,383
And I haven't interviewed anyone before so I like asking questions

234
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,295
Finish up the interview and I'll get back to you in a few days and I just remember she looks

235
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
BVI

236
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
If you're going to hire me

237
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
You need my phone now

238
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Like I was just like

239
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
That's exactly right so the next day I hired Mac

240
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
You know Maggie is now this year celebrating

241
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
XX

242
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Anniversary

243
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
So in those

244
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Early years

245
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
He must have just been working like a

246
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
Because you had to deal with billing

247
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Magazine getting new subscribers

248
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Expand Indianapolis

249
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Selling advertising like did you did you move to Indianapolis when you when you guys acquired unified Neighbors

250
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
No I didn't know actually I just drove back at

251
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Cricbuzz would have my week in Columbus

252
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
How how long is a drive by the way

253
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
3 hours

254
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
Like what you sleeping like 4 hours a night

255
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,823
It was it was it was a lot I mean you can find yourself you can just work work work

256
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
There's a lot of time in the day and you can work a lot of hours

257
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
That guy couldn't have picked

258
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
A better time in my life

259
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Have to do something

260
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
No family in your life or your kind of

261
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Geared to do that

262
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
It's funny though because

263
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
You are so different from almost

264
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Every entrepreneur that was interviewed in that

265
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
You are not

266
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Incredibly optimistic about the

267
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Success

268
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Tumblr Leone

269
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
You are

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Kind of thinking about maybe

271
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Packing it in you were not

272
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Natural Hustler

273
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
But you were doing all of these things

274
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
I think Avenue in retrospect music

275
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Think about what makes an object

276
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
An entrepreneur

277
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Honestly I think a lot of time

278
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
It comes down to per

279
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Yeah

280
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
And I think a lot of times people can have the big idea

281
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
And they can have

282
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
You know kind of that initial kind of fall in love

283
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
With their idea for

284
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Starting some

285
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
But

286
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
They don't write it through the heart

287
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
And I give it up

288
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Yeah

289
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
So while I might not have had the big idea and while I might not have been the big risk

290
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
I have perseverance

291
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
I think that

292
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
That is my aunt

293
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
Angie Hicks almost got downsized

Flash NPR

313
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
Just one more thing before I get back to the show

314
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
As you probably know by now

315
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,415
The end of every episode were telling your stories about the companies or products that

316

You are building so please do stick around after the credits to hear it

317

But for now

318
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Show

319
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
It's how I built this from NPR

320
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Gyros

321
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,007
So about three years in Angie's List have expanded form

322
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Two markets

323
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
4 Market

324
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
And so they decided to build a bigger manager

325
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
Bill oesterle came to work it

326
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Full-time CEO

327
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
She says

328
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,367
The crazy hours and hard work of the early years had really started to take a toll

329
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
I was super burnt

330
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
And so it was like a Jeep I know you

331
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
Periodically about business school why don't why do you think more seriously about

332
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
Not prepared to do that had to take the GMAT hadn't done anything but he basically decided in September that I would

333
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Apply that

334
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,639
Wait so you your plan for business school in the fall of 98

335
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,271
Like 3 years after you launch this company which is now really gaining Traction in and looks like it's going to

336
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Become something

337
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,439
Like I guess you could argue that those three years were kind of like your business school right like why did you

338
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Feel like

339
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
You wanted to go to business

340
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
You know for me if I hadn't

341
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
Taking that time I probably would

342
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
I kind of need

343
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Perspective

344
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
How do I learn to be a manager because I was forced to be a manager

345
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
Like I got through an acquisition I'd raise capital

346
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
But did I really understand everything that I

347
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
I was going through

348
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
And so it was a great time for me to step away and

349
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
I'm kind of gain for spect

350
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Applying to to school

351
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
2

352
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Kellogg

353
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Harvard

354
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
I ended up not getting it

355
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
How I got into Harvard

356
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
What was that like was it was

357
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
We are going there

358
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
You know I was

359
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,335
I've lived in Indiana or Ohio my entire life

360
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
It was one of those things where I was like I was

361
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
So flattered

362
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
To actually have just gotten

363
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Individual

364
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
A girl

365
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Middle class kid

366
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
First in our immediate family to go to call

367
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
So for me it was kind of like loud

368
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
What is kind of Adidas

369
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Experience I'm going to

370
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Take it for what it's worth

371
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
But maybe I had a differ

372
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Perspective

373
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,543
When you are at business school and you would like to run these models of

374
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
How business is ran or how to be a leader

375
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,967
Will you like where the time for you that's not how it works in the real world cuz I've been there

376
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Yeah

377
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,367
It was fascinating to watch you you'd have these conversations of companies

378
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
The cut 20% from its

379
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
From its bottom line New Jersey alternative people

380
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
People like what we should just cut 20% of staff

381
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
What kind of like

382
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Have you fired someone before

383
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Have you ever actually done that because

384
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
That's really hard to do

385
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,823
And yeah sometimes you have to do it and sometimes that's the right decision but

386
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Let's make sure we really understand the

387
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Wow you were there

388
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Will you

389
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
Involved with Angie's List

390
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Well I was actually I was still keeping

391
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,135
Was it your intention to go back

392
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Civility

393
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
How does the arrangement that like hay

394
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
You should go in

395
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Explore what there is.

396
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
Are you not like we're here but you should go see what

397
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Weather is

398
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Interview

399
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,543
I realize that sometimes you don't realize what you have until you

400
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Yeah

401
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
So I decided I was going to go back

402
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,015
By that point Bill had hired a chief operating officer

403
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
Who had conservatively model the business

404
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
In such a way that after I agreed to come

405
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Comeback Bill had to call me and say

406
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
We may not be able to afford

407
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Wait what

408
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
But why was that because you wouldn't NBA that point

409
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
No he was just like he was literally like we we now have too much overhead and I was like are you just being you

410
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
You are is this

411
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Send anywhere just like going to be like

412
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
This is what this is what the model says and I'm like you know what

413
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
I'm coming back

414
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,927
Screw you

415
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
I co-founded this company bill

416
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,887
Exactly needless to say the guy that ran the model was incredibly conservative on it

417
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
So we were all fine but it was is a funny moment

418
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
So when you got back what was your what was

419
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
How do I gave you

420
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,479
So the chief operating officer position was filled so I just decided to get a check mark

421
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
If this is going to be hard question for you to answer but it's just my observation that you must be

422
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
A person with almost

423
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
No

424
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Yo

425
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,023
I am I right I mean that's exactly right I joke around

426
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
I don't worry about titles I worry about getting

427
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
There's too much

428
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Stuff to worry about

429
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
To worry about

430
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
And maybe that's see I often

431
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Remind myself yeah cuz people ask me is

432
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
They come into the business

433
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,687
Like what's it like to work at like I like the last person to ask

434
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:40,319
I got tell people at orientation like I am really shy if you see me in the diner you need to come talk to me

435
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,207
Okay okay so you come back to the company after business school this is the early 2000s right

436
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Yeah so we

437
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
So that's what we started opening markets

438
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Anamorphic

439
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Places where opening one or two year

440
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
The invite

441
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
When did you go from being a

442
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
A newsletter

443
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Book a physical newsletter to being

444
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
An online company

445
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
So we put our first website up

446
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Play early

447
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Mauser 99

448
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
And basically literally we hired two college kids

449
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Seville archives

450
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
Which is a basic like you know marketing informational website

451
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
I had email

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
You couldn't check the list

453
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I was just for Market

454
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
So how's that website working one day

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
We realize it's like you know half of our sign

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
We're coming in over the

457
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
I guess I should actually build a web

458
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
So you know

459
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
I was like yeah

460
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
It's probably more in

461
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
Interesting to read the reviews then to have Angie read the reviews to you either getting the mailing

462
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Well they were just calling at the number

463
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Taking this online is it

464
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Like a business model is based on

465
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
Basically building a community of

466
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Trust

467
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
End

468
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
You have did this before the airbnb's and the

469
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,800
The Ubers and that you know these are there that the sharing economy kind of

470
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Right so

471
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
At the beginning or people

472
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Skeptical of others

473
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah I think it was actually even an article written

474
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
She's probably

475
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
10 or 12 years ago about the fact that

476
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:22,208
There was a Fascination as to why consumers were willing to share their opinions with

477
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,560
They're like you for information that they are giving you

478
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Get right yeah

479
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
The article and it was a

480
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
There was something

481
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,824
Special about the service at first I thought it was like oh it's Columbus because I know all the members are

482
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
What's Indianapolis but

483
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
There's almost there's there is a sense of belonging and obligation

484
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,344
It's became a culture of the service in it replicated itself in city after

485
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
After City

486
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
I mean what are the values we

487
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
We had it was the fact that we started when we

488
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
We started pre-internet days

489
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,840
In many ways we looked at who we were going to mimic

490
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
For our business model

491
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
We looked at journalist

492
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
Every story has a sore

493
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah even occur to us

494
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
That we should allow people to review anonymous

495
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
Isn't that proved incredibly powerful

496
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
Why do you think people were willing to write these

497
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Refuse that

498
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
They're paying for

499
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Because if they didn't

500
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
The next first

501
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,304
And if you think about the kind of decisions are making around your home I mean these

502
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,376
Hi I called you like the high cost of failure decision

503
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
It's right I mean it's the time when

504
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
You probably know the least about what you're buying

505
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
You spending a lot of money

506
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,616
And if it goes wrong it could potentially ruin your largest

507
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Yeah

508
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Are there bad information and I mean cuz a lot of these companies are small company so how do I find out where

509
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
XYZ Plumbing is any good

510
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
There's lots of places to get information

511
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
But people are willing to pay for Quality Inn

512
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,632
As you get started to expanded you

513
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Did you go out and raise money

514
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
We did you know that you know that was one of the things

515
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,056
Bill having a venture-capital back

516
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Was incredibly valuable for us

517
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,248
Cuz usually nrr raising money came around you no wanting to

518
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Grow the market

519
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,368
Okay so what you're saying is you didn't need money to manufacture a product

520
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,000
You were primarily spending money on marketing

521
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
We're requiring members were to stick around for a long

522
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,632
Upfront the marketing to acquire

523
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,728
Once we were able to scale to National Market

524
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,056
Erased opening

525
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
So in about 18 months we opened 100 mark

526
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
What were some of the mistakes that you made

527
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Why you were in that in that sir

528
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Carol expansion

529
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
So you know

530
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
We waited a number of years before we opened

531
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Chicago

532
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
Cuz we were really uneasy about the

533
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
The cost of

534
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Expanding into a city that big

535
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,328
You know what we realized we open there was

536
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
You know it just took off like

537
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Like crazy why did most companies start on the coast

538
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Because there's

539
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
For the population of

540
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,336
Absolute office

541
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
And clearly that strategy

542
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
How many members by the way do you have today

543
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,808
Over 3 million babe

544
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Whatever you ever just about everything

545
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
DUI

546
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Like when you see a

547
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
Incredibly positive review

548
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
And also incredibly negative

549
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
If you like but how do you know which one to believe

550
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
What I often find when I look at reviews

551
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
You know one it's really important to actually read

552
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,896
I learned this early

553
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
No matter how great you are as a cup

554
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Company you're going to get

555
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,576
Honestly believe you learn more when you can

556
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Can see a company that has

557
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
A couple of complaints here and there

558
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
Then you do about a company that has all glowing

559
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
You know what I'm part of that is like hey Ya

560
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
They might make a mistake

561
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
Can you really want to know how they're going to handle it when the

562
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
What's going to happen if that

563
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
You know what the countertop was wrong length

564
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
And now they have to redo it

565
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,408
Because that's what you was a consumer fear right I fear when the job doesn't go well

566
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,040
And you don't on the flipside no years ago I mean cash early on in the business we allowed companies

567
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Start responding to reviews

568
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,160
Cuz they were like hey it's not mean I actually understand that

569
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
The consumer gets to give their opinion

570
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
A chance to say our side of the

571
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
Historic and so we introduced that witch

572
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Purple incredibly valuable

573
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
The consumer

574
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
Because you do want to know how they're going to rain

575
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,264
Right but I do spend a lot of time talking to service companies and kind of

576
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
Encouraging them not to

577
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Respond on

578
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:01,248
Cuz usually that's when they're angry no one likes negative feedback hours to Jessica to get a cup of coffee comebacks

579
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Think about it before they

580
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Because

581
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
What they say can be more powerful than 10 reviews

582
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Might ever

583
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,768
To do like when you have to get something fixed in your house

584
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Do the contractor to show up

585
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
Are they freaking out like as a super nervous they're like oh my God Angie is going to like ruin me if you can

586
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Ruin me

587
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
I'm okay my reviews

588
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
Start with the same as everyone

589
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
But yes

590
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
You a lot of times my husband

591
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Is the one that

592
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
At home when

593
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
And we have worked on

594
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,344
Pics is not my married name so so that helps until they kind of

595
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
Look around the room and start seeing you

596
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Pictures

597
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
And they were like oh wait

598
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
They're like holy crap it's Angie

599
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
It's Angie Hicks of Angie's List she still the chief marketing officer at the company Chicot

600
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:01,152
I found it and despite her best efforts to avoid the spotlight she says she can't go to grocery stores or flea

601
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,248
Anywhere without someone asking her for advice on finding a contractor

602
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
I'm getting some bathroom tiling done this is true story in Washington DC just have the top of your head

611
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
Thanks for sticking around because we are now at

612
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
The part of the show where we get to tell your stories about the things that

613
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
You're telling this one came about when Brett Johnson noticed

614
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
2011 and 2012 I think it was there was a big cayenne pepper crazy kind of swept across the country

615
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,672
Maybe it wasn't the craze but apparently a lot of people were touting the health benefits of cayenne pepper

616
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,512
I had this idea what if we could integrate cayenne pepper into a throat loss

617
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
Cayenne pepper into a throat lozenge something they called

618
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Fire truck

619
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,704
Put it in your mouth and it takes about 15 to 20 seconds for the actual

620
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Giant really hit you

621
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
You can feel it in the back of your throat you feel this kind of soothing effect

622
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,176
Of the spice of the cayenne pepper I know this may not sound very soothing

623
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
But Brett says that the heat from the pepper actually feels really great on your throat

624
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
A lot of customers who are singers and actors they really like the fire drop because they feel as soon as their vocal

625
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,744
Chords and helps them kind of feel after night of performance

626
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,072
Bracelet that for now most of the people who are buying fire drops have

627
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
Cold or sore throat

628
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
And I mean is it for years in

629
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
Company still has a small problem

630
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
We're seasonal business in summer time is a slow time for colds and sore throats and so it becomes

631
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
Challenge to figure out how to manage cash flow properly

632
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
Despite that challenge Brad says the company is just

633
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,064
Starting to break even full-time jobs in addition to this because it's kind of a

634
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,648
Growing operation right now the goal is to August take a full-time someday but

635
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:24,256
But the growing operation for now tell us the story of the company or the movement that

636
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
