Hope to see you there

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,880
I had to go get another job besides Cisco

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
And we had only my income and we were

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,048
Mortgage the house to the hill which we might have lasted any particular time

28
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,424
And we had creditors up the Wazoo and I have people calling me at 2 in the morning complaining because

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
They didn't have their routers

30
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
Yeah it was very hand mouth

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,616
People who want to be entrepreneurs

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
Really don't understand

33
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
Robin PR it's how I built this

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
Stories behind the movements

36
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
They built

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
I'm guy Raz and I'm house Sandy Lerner help

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,752
What are the most successful companies in the world why she had to leave it

39
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
How she went on to remake herself

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Again

41
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
That again

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,576
If you use the internet today or if you're listening to me right now through your

43
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Smartphone

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
Computer there's a pretty good chance that that information

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
Flowing through a network that was developed by Cisco Systems

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
Cisco is the largest networking company in the world

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
Hardware servers routers and software touch almost

48
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Every part of

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Internet

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Now the idea that

51
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
One computer can talk to another computer

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Particularly Earthship

53
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
But in the early 80s

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
Pretty big challenge even it's Stanford University

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Did you work tonight

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Computer and say that

57
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Engineering department

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,256
It couldn't talk to a computer in another part of the campus

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
We take for granted like

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Email or instant messaging

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Slack

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
There was no infrastructure to make these things work

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
On a big scale

64
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
But there was an informal group of graduate students

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Stanford

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
I was trying to solve this very problem

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Lerner happened to be

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Part of that group

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Other grad student Len bosack founded

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Cisco Systems

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,000
Today it has a market cap of around 200 billion dollars

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
But that grows

73
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
It happened largely

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
After Sandy and Len left the company

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
After Sandy was

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Pushed out

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
It was

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
Pretty devastating at the time and we'll get to some of that story but

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
After all of that

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
Sandy went on to build another

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,040
Successful an entirely different type of business a Cosmetics company called Urban Decay

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
And then she reinvented herself yet again

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,256
By starting an 800-acre sustainable Farm in Virginia where is she now lives

84
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,584
Annie's childhood almost sounds like a fairytale

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Her mom and dad split up

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
When she was just four years old

87
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Family

88
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,544
Sandy was sent off to live with one of her aunts

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Which sounds like it could have been pretty traumatic

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,432
Except her aunt lived in Beverly Hills

91
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Made Sandy

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
The center of her life

93
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
I thought

94
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
It was a

95
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Wonderful thing to go and stay with my aunt she was very cool

96
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
She had a very elegant world

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
We would go to the merry company Tea Room

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm sitting at gorgeous blue dining room I didn't think life got any better

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
So you

100
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
Your childhood was spent

101
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,335
Largely in living with his aunt in Beverly Hills until I'm six and then there came a day when

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
My aunt sister said if you come live with me

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
I'll give you a Coney

104
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
And my other Aunt Beverly Hills said what

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
If you live with me when you're 16 you can have a car

106
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
But you know when you're sick should think my God I might not even live that long

107
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Maybe they won't be car so I took the pony weight

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,071
They were competing for you to live with them did I hit the jackpot or what

109
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
See you at age 6 move to where

110
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Clipper Gap it's in the

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Fire Sierra foothills of

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Northeastern

113
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Part of the state

114
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
California California and what what

115
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
What is a live with a ranch with a farm

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
It started out a hundred acres and they were farming Paris and my grandpa lived up there also

117
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
And erasing some cattle

118
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
And

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I just

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Download farming

121
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
To you

122
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Yes

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
When it was time to go to college you

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Stayed pretty close right

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,031
Left home at 15 and got a job working at the bank for year-and-a-half before I left College

126
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Auburn

127
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,151
6 miles down the road it was it just a job

128
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
You're my uncle Jim for small town America with the Kiwanis

129
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,087
Put the bank manager and you know I think my uncle was kind of watching out for me and making sure that I had a

130
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Safe place

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,999
It was a terrible job the bank owner made all of the tellers Neal

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
So he could check that our skirts were long enough

133
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Any called assault Lewis

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,447
This isn't like 1970 1971 278 1971 1972

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
We were always because he knew Louise she been there awhile and we didn't really rate our own names and where you at

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
At that time

137
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Get where you erase about that

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Did you see the about that

139
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
You don't miss the first time I'd ever experienced any sort of sex is

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Amy on the farm

141
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,719
I was a kid you know so you did the boy x you did the girl jobs you did you know I loaded the gas trucks

142
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Summer

143
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
You just got on with it

144
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
The first time I hit sexism

145
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Donut just

146
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Completely

147
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
Rattled my world and I needed to get out

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
I just needed to get out

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
So I guess it was around that time that

150
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
You did decide to go to college and you went to

151
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,735
Sigma Chico State in in California what did you say what did you say there

152
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
My undergraduate degrees are in

153
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,183
International relations with an emphasis on comparative communist Theory and a minor in Marxist economics

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
That works for the Vietnam Nursery

155
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
Did you have a sense of what you wanted to do or absolutely I went to college in 2 years

156
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
And I wanted

157
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,543
2B I had it all mapped out I would have my PhD by the time I was 22 did your degree in 2 years

158
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
I mean obviously you're

159
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
I mean you're a highly intelligent person but were you just heard of

160
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
Did you feel unusual minutes that's very fast

161
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,343
Was a lot of work it was it was a tough two years but on the other hand

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
I was so convinced

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
I was never going back to that bank

164
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Never

165
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Yeah never

166
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
Never ever going back to that bank and having to put up with that

167
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
I ended up getting an absolutely

168
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
First rated

169
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
So how did you go from

170
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Studying Marxist

171
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
Economics international relations 2

172
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Sterling computers

173
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Well

174
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,151
I went to Claremont Graduate School because I had a full scholarship

175
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
The first quarter I ended up being an advisor in the computer room

176
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,879
You know 1975 I was making 25 bucks an hour computer programming

177
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
You to me it was easy and it was

178
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Something.

179
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
I thought would pave the way it is

180
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
Being able to enter the job market in a good place

181
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
So you are studying

182
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
You should have

183
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Supposed to Computing at

184
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Claremont

185
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
And then what what was your name at this point I still thought I wanted to be a

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Academic

187
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
And so I

188
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Picked up my

189
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Little Sailfin

190
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Applied to Stanford in because

191
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
Political science department there

192
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,231
Needed programmers because of course they were getting to the point where you couldn't publish anything if it didn't have some numbers in it

193
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
They let me in

194
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,167
I got in and immediately segwayed into the statistics and computer science department

195
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
1975-76

196
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Stanford like

197
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Now it's a legendary

198
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Timer

199
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
It's like we're talking about

200
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Beginnings the internet and all these

201
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
People influenced by jcr licklider and and

202
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Steve Jobs going through Park Xerox

203
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Meteora

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
That was amazing time so

205
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
You get to Stanford

206
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
In late 70

207
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
Is what is a computer look like

208
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,655
What were you were working with their brothers really like here Clermont we had a duct system 10

209
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,287
And that's what I learned program on and I learned a number the programming languages and did a little bit on

210
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
Assistance programming but when I got to Stanford

211
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
They also their dick Townsend

212
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Which was great because it's a huge time sharing system

213
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Would have 200 simultaneous users

214
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
And since I've been running the mouth

215
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,415
Statistical software on that timeshare Computing at Claremont

216
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
They had a

217
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
Watch volunteers it so I became a lot to volunteer a lot volunteer actually overloaded time sharing system

218
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,983
Got a little orange time showing system but just explain this to me in language that I can understand

219
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
When you say you were programming

220
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
These computers you were

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
Taking in raw data and helping them to

222
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Creates the

223
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,831
Statistics from that that's right and this was just would come to you intuitively like you just

224
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Kind of learned this

225
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
Biplane ride with it

226
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Absolutely not I work my butt off

227
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
When I was in high school girls didn't get to take

228
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
Worth your Calculus when I was in high school girls should get to take

229
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Physics

230
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
So I had to learn all that stuff in garage

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
You have to learn how to program

232
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Oh absolutely what did you love about

233
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
2 things when the money

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,455
Don't to the Independence that it offered was which hugely attractive

235
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
You know not being tied to hours not being tied to a desk

236
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
You know I've always been kind of an anarchist

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
Down the idea that you could come and go in as long as you got the work done

238
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
Nobody cared about your day

239
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
When you got to stand for

240
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
What was your impression of the place was it was it like

241
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
Now I finally arrive to this amazing

242
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Valhalla

243
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Technology

244
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Donut technology of smart

245
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
I wasn't freak anymore

246
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
They were very welcoming and I had great friends the computer

247
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Computer science and

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
What's the time sharing system

249
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,111
And we would have two meals a day together and with who

250
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
This group of Engineers

251
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
All hang out around

252
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
Computer labs basically absolutely

253
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
We hear a lot about the and we know a lot about the gender gap in

254
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
In the tech world

255
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
What kind of the late 70s

256
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
You must have been like one of

257
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
One or two or three

258
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Three women

259
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Around all of these male

260
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Gretchen silver very seriously I was the only

261
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Graduate-level female

262
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
It was also a very

263
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Welcoming group and

264
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
They didn't care real Hero3 for high grain and stink as long as you

265
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
As long as you have the technical chops and you kept up

266
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
And I could do that is a small group of people

267
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
You know they were probably about

268
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,911
8:10 or 12 if people would sort of ribs in a drift outfit remember we had two meals a day together

269
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
We spent the weekends

270
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,311
And watch the other I mean I would leave these people at 2 in the morning

271
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Computer

272
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Exit

273
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,247
Total programmers total when the people had written the first spell checker and typed in the entire dictionary incel

274
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
One of us

275
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
How to triple Major at Stanford and a master's degree in 4 years

276
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
And we will all

277
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
Computer addicts in love with this particular architecture

278
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
We built our own internet

279
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,447
We maintain our own internet with built-in printer and interfaces we built around computer terminals

280
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
It was just one of those times in life where what you

281
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
What you gave me

282
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
You got back

283
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
How did you meet

284
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Len bosack

285
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
I'm at Len the first time when he was interviewing Stanford

286
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
And I mean that it was Stanford was not interviewing Glenn

287
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
When was interviews

288
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
Well he was thinking about getting master's degree

289
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
And he was kicking around thinking he needed something

290
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
To do

291
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,631
On that day I remember we went to Chinese food and remember these guys are all

292
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,751
Largely overweight and they're not the people were picked on the baseball team and

293
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
Girl sitting around in these guys are flaming themselves out with hot oil

294
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
On the Chinese food

295
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
I like all red in there like perspiring and everything

296
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
And when sat there

297
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
They were all like being very noisy and

298
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
You don't of questionable hygiene

299
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
And Wednesday out there in his clothes are ironed in his clothes match

300
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Beautiful

301
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
White herons very soft voice

302
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
You can eat with a knife and fork

303
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,887
When they would get all done arguing with each other they would look Atlanta David's a well

304
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
You know basically essentially what is what is the answer

305
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
When didn't join in until they invited him and then he would tell them the answer and then they would

306
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Arguing arguing then they would come back and stay woke

307
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
Glenwood is the answer to I was just absolutely Enchanted

308
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
I have never seen a more perfect human being in my entire life

309
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Basically

310
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
You guys

311
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Became partners

312
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
It was very

313
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Quiet because the Dynamics of the group worth it

314
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
You know you

315
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
You weren't supposed to have favorites

316
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,935
That would have been very destructive to kind of

317
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Ouija

318
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,031
Kind of group dynamics there and so it was

319
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
Really nobody even knew we were seeing each other until we decided that we wanted to get married

320
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
I'm trying to I'm trying to get a sense of

321
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
What

322
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
Some of the problems you are dealing with in

323
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
At Stanford in the

324
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
Early 80s basically Stanford

325
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Right at the cusp of

326
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,047
You notice the bleeding edge of the technological Revolution

327
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
Lots of computers all over Stanford presumably

328
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
But

329
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
I guess they couldn't

330
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
Communicate with each other was that that was a problem

331
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Well if used to be that

332
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
You either bought that computers you bought IBM where you bought hpu you bought data General you bought Wang or you bought whatever cuz those wood

333
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
The only ones that could communicate like

334
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
I didn't feel like a meeting with IBM

335
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
That is true but the reason was that it was so new

336
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
You entered into this Unholy alliance with

337
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Put the vendor and they would help you

338
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
IC

339
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
To some departments had

340
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
IBM some head.

341
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
Some had doubts or whatever was around

342
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
Well whatever they felt match the researcher there

343
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
You know pedagogical requirements save

344
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Were aligned to themselves and

345
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
But what they wanted which is typical University

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Everybody wants autonomy

347
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Do the 5000

348
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Computers

349
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Many more stamp

350
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,647
This is the late seventies and these computers could not talk to each other and Sprite

351
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Animo Stanford against

352
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Was actually trying to build it

353
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Own computer network

354
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Wasn't

355
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Working so what in

356
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,679
In the meantime we don't want you are doing a shadow Network yourself

357
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
You land in this group of Engineers you guys are trying to figure plus all the people in the in the arpanet community

358
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
If you were working on parts of this

359
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Ann Arbor dentist that precursor

360
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,807
By the government and that's what our power was for it was it was a network to

361
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
To Foster

362
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
The interaction and inter sharing of

363
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
Ideas and information

364
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
Among the different people who are taking taking our money

365
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
And that's what we were doing so

366
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
So

367
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
How are you doing this

368
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Stanford aware of what you're doing

369
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Officially

370
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Absolutely not

371
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:14,079
We were definitely under the radar and we kept it under the radar and it wasn't until

372
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
One day

373
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
1981

374
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
AR

375
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Time sharing ethernet

376
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Became the Stanford University Network

377
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Wow just one day it just

378
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
You know that

379
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,719
Benediction winning in our Direction and then we were there we were the Stanford University Network

380
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
So you created

381
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
A system that would allow these computers to

382
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Communicate what today we would just call it router

383
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
You build a network

384
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
At Stanford what was the thing that was motivating

385
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Why did you want to do

386
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Search for Stanford

387
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
I didn't do it for Stanford

388
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
I think there's a lot of

389
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Misunderstanding about

390
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Those early

391
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
RP years we did it because

392
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
It was the right thing to do

393
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
Giving money if it's all public

394
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Public domain

395
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
Nobody had a financial motive

396
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
The thing that are paid that was so

397
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
Amazing even today

398
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Was

399
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
Gave the right people the right money

400
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
It wasn't political it wasn't

401
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,359
There wasn't any religion involved in it it was just this collection of these incredibly smart

402
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
Dedicated people who made

403
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
I was really really lucky to get to be a part of

404
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
I mean everything that you could do everyday

405
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
And you can hook something you up for you get you know you could get a message someplace so you could

406
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
You could just use milestones and it was

407
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
I guess if you're a nerd it was just a

408
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Terminus adrenaline rush

409
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
So

410
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
You are in your twenties this time

411
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Sherpas government agency is

412
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
Funding all these cool projects that eventually would help

413
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Create the internet

414
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
You are part of this team that

415
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
They create a network

416
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
It Stanford then adopts as its

417
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Sparkle and an attack Point these 5000 computers

418
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
Are able to talk to each other

419
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
So what

420
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
At that point

421
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Yuan when were you married at that point

422
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Yeah we married 1980

423
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
We both graduated from Stanford same Department sting

424
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Same platform

425
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
In June of 1981 with master's degrees

426
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Beyond

427
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
Lynn had walked into a job is that

428
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
Computing systems for the Department of computer science and I got no job running

429
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Pearson Business School

430
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
So we were looking at

431
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Long happy

432
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
Nerdy careers in that environment

433
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Wouldn't you want to do something with with a routing technology that that you'd worked on who absolutely but Stanford said

434
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
No you cannot licenses to

435
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Technology

436
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
They would not entertain

437
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Any any license

438
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
We have done our part and we taking the government's money this is all public domain

439
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,663
Weed invented all of these wonderful things but the office of Technology licensing didn't let anything out

440
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
And Stanford was not even letting us sell it to the university

441
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
So you and Landon

442
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Are frustrated

443
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,695
Because you believe that this technology needs to get out into the world that there's

444
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,303
All kinds of music Arthur money this is United States money we don't have a right to

445
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
The stuff we didn't develop we did develop

446
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
We didn't invent it

447
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
It was a community

448
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
People

449
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
Very smart very committed in all of these different places and in Stanford all of these different departments there was a huge coming

450
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
India South Point

451
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
Stanford was saying

452
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Just know

453
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
And you didn't care you weren't

454
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Saying hey we're going to take the money for this

455
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Know that the money would go to Stanford or or

456
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,279
Percent of it as long as you know they paid the bill for the parts we are good jobs

457
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
So was it at that point where you and lands are said

458
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
We thirsty

459
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Ourselves

460
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
At that point I believe that lend you a whole lot more about business than I did and at some point he looked at me and he says well

461
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,871
We're just going to have to go in build this stuff

462
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
On our own money because we can't do it the university won't allow us to do it within the university so one day I drove up San Francisco

463
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
Give me the $5 bill and started company

464
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,183
$5 bill for $5 at that point to register with the California soccer

465
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Tri-State furniture

466
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
And so you are

467
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Trying to build a company that

468
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Just in layman's terms

469
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Would help

470
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Computers communicate

471
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
Just we're trying to build terminal service and routers

472
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
And he called it

473
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
Well that came later Cisco is actually the

474
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
36 theme

475
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
We tried to get anything having to do with

476
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Computers we couldn't have

477
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
Because it was taken by someone else to Cisco as in San Francisco

478
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Yes and I design

479
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,695
It was my name and I came up because we were at that point two routers at Gateway

480
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
So I came up with logo the Golden Gate Bridge which is still the logo for Cisco

481
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Going

482
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,471
So we just with tears on Rice basically said well I guess we've got to go do this

483
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
I had no idea what we were getting into

484
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
I think you had no interest in and leaving your job to Stanford

485
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
At that point

486
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Leaking is comfortable life when you notice of servicing the computers

487
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
But this time this was 1980s

488
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
4 and they were starting

489
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
2B Creeks I mean I was paid

490
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Half of what my predecessor made and I was paid

491
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
I was paid a third what my successor was paid

492
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Wow

493
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Found you know when

494
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
The Faculty would meet at

495
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,704
At the beginning of the year to plan the curriculum even though I was ahead of all of the Computing facilities

496
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
Both administrative and

497
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
Curriculum

498
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,336
Computing I went to have lunch with

499
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
The Faculty wives because where they had their annual meeting

500
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
This isn't this isn't 19

501
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
384

502
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
It was starting to

503
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
The creek and I was getting a little bit bored in

504
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
Dominican microcomputers were starting to come in

505
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
I really didn't have a lot of interest

506
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
And that

507
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
So I would say that

508
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
I was ready for something

509
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Chanel spit

510
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Yeah it's a complete

511
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Misunderstanding of the times to think that

512
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,360
Len and I had huge dollar signs in her eyes and knew that this company was going to go public and make a decillion dollars

513
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,528
Whatever this is really where the story gets a little complicated

514
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Pierce

515
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
Trying abbreviated

516
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
During that. You think

517
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
You you leave Stanford

518
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
And then Len also leaves

519
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,888
What you guys are doing with Cisco in the end

520
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,264
They claim that you've stolen their technology right in and they threatened to take legal action

521
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
So how did you deal with that situation

522
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Well

523
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
When Lenin died left

524
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,248
When Les Stanford a great deal of the engineering team behind

525
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,112
The internet at Stanford left and so Stanford was left with a network it didn't

526
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
Having the ability to run and certainly

527
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Nothing to maintain

528
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
So within that

529
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,352
Very fortunate Confluence of events for serendipitous Confluence of events

530
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,472
We actually did have some bargaining power and we ended up paying them I think a very fair royalty for

531
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
The first

532
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,592
Gosh I want to say $3000000 a product or something very fair royalty

533
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
And we had to fix the network for 3 years

534
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
So that's

535
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Pretty good deal

536
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
You know what's what it's the deal they should have made video you know if they'd have said here pay us a modest royalty that you can handle

537
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
From Castle point of view

538
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
And maintain our Network where you going

539
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Okay

540
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
And how are you bristle how are you funding your company I mean to build credit cards

541
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,960
Starhome friend of mine used to work for me at Stanford with synonym

542
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
Telephone and tell our vendors that the check was in the mail

543
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
How are you even getting customers you were just

544
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Just

545
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
The internet new

546
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:49,248
Me and Len the internet knew about the routers the internet was the internet and everybody

547
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Who was part of that wanted

548
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
What you were

549
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
By 1987

550
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
With no Salesforce we were booking a quarter million dollars

551
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
A month wow who are you

552
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
Our first customer

553
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Was

554
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories

555
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Second was Rutgers University third when was Boeing

556
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,008
And by that time the internet Community had matured

557
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,152
Found it was no longer just the bleeding edge that that were ordering these internet works which were Network subnet

558
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,528
So it did kind of moved into the keeping up with the Joneses in the sense that if you didn't have an internet

559
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
It was kind of

560
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
You are backwards so the style had changed and you can't rebuilding these

561
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
In a in our living room and Lenz parents soldering iron

562
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Absolutely

563
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Both job started in garage at least I living room

564
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
What is the actual

565
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
When when I'm trying to imagine you guys

566
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
Soldering and building these

567
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Rappers

568
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,480
What would it look like was it was a giant thing that was at the size of this room

569
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Redbox

570
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
So it wasn't that much

571
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
It was as of today

572
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Well

573
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
Today's routers are that size

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,584
You don't question because I you and Len

575
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Wer

576
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Programmer

577
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
You're you guys could sit at terminal

578
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
And figure out

579
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
How to create

580
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
These programs that would then do things

581
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
That's what I that's what I want to know how did you

582
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
How did you know how to build the hardware is it something that you just kind of figured out nothing to do essentially with the hardware

583
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
Hardware engineer and that's how Cisco made its money

584
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Because of Len

585
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
Annie's Hardware engineering Lynn also happens to be

586
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Unparalleled

587
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Systems programmer

588
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
Let's just really good were you stressed

589
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,240
Out about I understand that you were motivated

590
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
My money but you had to have money to

591
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Absolutely

592
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
I had to go get another job besides Cisco

593
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
I work for Somerset computing

594
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,016
Computer aided systems laboratory running running their computers

595
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
And we had

596
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
Only my income and I didn't have a car

597
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:07,488
And with seven people that we're working we were mortgage the house to the hilt which we might have lost it any

598
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Particular time

599
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,632
I'm and we had creditors up the Wazoo and I have people calling me at 2 in the morning

600
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Complaining because

601
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
They didn't have their

602
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,592
Router or they're terminal server and yeah it was stress cuz you didn't have a factory you were making each one

603
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,176
We have the money to build the damn things we were having to buy parts on credit

604
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
Wow we had every credit card maxed out Kirk Lockheed was one of the founders gave us $10,000 length.

605
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Give us $10,000

606
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Robert Michael Salon is $10,000

607
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
He worked at HP

608
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:43,584
IHC Labs but everybody want to call these people want to buy them from you just could not make them

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
Fast and Furious have the money to make think about the University

610
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
The payment site

611
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
You know

612
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Universities by the time they're budgeted

613
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Write 90 days later

614
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Yeah and

615
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
I mean literally

616
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
We would get the money

617
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
We had pretty good Martin semi we were we were doing a good business

618
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
We would get some money and we would pay off the the two months bills before but then if you had an order for another

619
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Under 20 boxers

620
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,536
We had already mortgaged the house

621
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
You got it it's its

622
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Just a few of you

623
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Make me leave unless beginning

624
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Trying to build this

625
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
You obviously have this thing that a lot of

626
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,920
Companies are interested in a lot of universities a lot of people are interested

627
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Why didn't you just go and get

628
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
To put someone in the company

629
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,600
We went through about 70 radium 70 or 80

630
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
And the problem was that

631
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
You know this point the investor Community wishes

632
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Fairchild

633
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Semiconductor salesman

634
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
They didn't think that you could make any money out of public protocol because of course everybody would do it you know deck that was a proprietary

635
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Protocol sna technology was in the public domain

636
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,200
You know anybody can do this right you you don't own this

637
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
Right everybody else was going to do it

638
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
What would make sense

639
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Price accept it if everybody could do it why didn't they

640
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
So when you went to investors

641
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Pitch them on the

642
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
They had no clue what I was talking about

643
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
First of all there was a woman found

644
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,888
They're all 60 or 70 they just didn't know how to relate to a woman

645
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Investments yunnan

646
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Any lettuce

647
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,264
A great guy but he's not normal

648
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Meaning

649
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,640
Well the two of us are pretty abnormal I mean so I was basically a translator a lot of

650
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
You were the you were the face you would front man

651
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
Well armed woman not a lot of people can have a conversation with Lynn

652
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
And were you

653
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Feeling

654
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,744
I don't know what are you feeling dejected or nervous or anxious I mean you you needed to build these you didn't

655
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
You have money

656
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,328
I think that I've never been in a war

657
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,168
But I think that we had all of us who are there are there probably about

658
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
10 or 12 of us at that time

659
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Very much had a trench mentality

660
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
How are you paying everybody

661
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
We could get

662
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Enough

663
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
Income fast enough to meet payroll

664
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
And we had a whole bunch of free labor

665
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
Lin's parents were building cables and

666
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,112
My aunts came down and did xeroxing for us and

667
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
I was managing the cash flow

668
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
But it was very hand mouth

669
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,536
In a way that I think that people who want to be entrepreneurs yesterday's

670
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864
Really don't understand why was it exciting or was it

671
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
No

672
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
It was nerve-racking

673
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
If you can imagine being in a World War 1 trench in the mud

674
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Been constantly shell

675
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
By the by the Germans and the mustard gas and

676
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
And no food and no relief and no sleep

677
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
I it was not exciting

678
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
When we come back

679
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
How Sandy and Len

680
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Finally did get their funding

681
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Cisco Systems

682
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
And why they both

683
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Eventually walked out

684
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Company

685
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976

731
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
They found the guy they need it

732
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,008
I guess it's at that point where you

733
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Come across

734
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
A guy who is

735
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
The following investment

736
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
Avicii World valentine

737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
You

738
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
Come across them and this is the time where you are really desperate

739
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,112
Preferred cash and what is Don Valentine he's with Sequoia

740
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Capital what is he

741
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,816
Don't told us that well you know taking 200 companies public you walk into his office and you know what your little cubes back there you got

742
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
Like always lucite cubes in business

743
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,520
Untenable mountain and he says you know you'll be part of the Don Valentine group of companies

744
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
Cons of company

745
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Wow oh yeah

746
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
So the guy lost apple and Intel

747
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Is comedian saying

748
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,504
Yes and telling us that

749
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,088
So don't worry about getting your own lawyer will let you know will pay for it

750
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,696
Let him I walked into a four-year vesting plan after funding the company

751
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,816
For three years clearly and mezzanine investment we're making we're booking quarter million dollars a month

752
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Warrior fasting plan means

753
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Your

754
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
We have four years

755
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
To put in to get our stock

756
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
And no employment con

757
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
And what did he get

758
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
40 give you what he got

759
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
She gave us 2.6 million dollars and

760
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,784
Linen I got about 30% but remember he was the chairman of the board of the company and he got stock from the out and all of his friends go

761
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,624
I think we're foreshadowing that this story does not end well

762
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
To watch

763
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Tsotsobe

764
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Don Valentine

765
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Is NOW essential

766
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
CNN so

767
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
What did she say to you guys

768
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
I don't want you to run the company

769
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
Don't know he was done is much more clever than that

770
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,104
Don said well for the good of the company when you get you a

771
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,480
Professional CEO of the good of the company you know we need a professional CFO and Len and I were still kind of doing this

772
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
I think we wanted to believe

773
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
Yeah given our health or marriage everything for this company and here's this guy who's been wildly successful and

774
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
And we we truly

775
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
Didn't want to believe that that was for the best

776
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
And just next strategy

777
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Disturbing someone in

778
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Who is hasta

779
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
What's a CEO

780
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
Is a seasonal job mortgage

781
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,312
But I will swear the first thing he said to me was I hear you're everything that's wrong with Cisco

782
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
When the first time you

783
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
So

784
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
When John mortgage

785
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
Comes in to run the company

786
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
Tell me what he would have thought was wrong with

787
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Well

788
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Cisco by this time

789
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
How does Salesforce to Salesforce look like

790
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Turn on time but younger

791
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Salesman

792
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Way into the

793
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,264
This current millennium are still having the parties with the naked girls jumping out of the cake

794
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
And all of the stuff that was a typo

795
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
The Caymans

796
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
So it sounds like

797
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
I like once

798
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
The the money came in from

799
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Don Valentine

800
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Sequoia

801
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,392
Lead like the kind of took over the culture that you guys have you heard this culture of

802
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Passionate

803
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
Computer programmers and they brought in

804
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
Salespeople who

805
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
Different a different motivation

806
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,680
A different motivation they had a very different set of experiences

807
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
We have a very complicated product

808
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
Then we were people been talking to each other

809
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
Predicated right

810
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
I mean

811
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
If you think about it

812
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
20 years ago try explaining what a router did peep

813
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
We didn't

814
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
Normal things in the steel salesman

815
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,904
They would come in and they would start talking to

816
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
You gave me answer Lana Robert Michaels her

817
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Uniqlo heater

818
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
Greg Sauter one of those people

819
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
The engineers for just like you staring at

820
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,960
They weren't staying the same language they had no clue and so I was trying a to translate

821
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
And be to take the flag from the sales pitch

822
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Translate it right it up

823
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
And discuss it with the engineering PE

824
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,200
These guys were used to having a product that they frankly didn't understand but

825
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
To sell a Cisco box

826
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
I think I do understand some part of it

827
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
Because it's what made us different and

828
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
It's what's made us successful

829
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
At one point I was at dawn and I

830
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
Because he was arguing that

831
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
We didn't need more floor space

832
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
We literally didn't have a place to set

833
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Boxes that we're making

834
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
Every company invest

835
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
Always wants more space and they always go out of business

836
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Who said you don't understand on

837
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
This going to be a 1 billion dollar company

838
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
How do you know that

839
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
I said

840
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,664
Look at the people here

841
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
And then I said the most stupid thing I've ever said in my life

842
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Which was

843
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Leaving me out of it

844
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,112
These people are really really special

845
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
And I did it because I felt

846
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,536
I go for the grandma who said pretty is as pretty does and you don't say nice things about yourself

847
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
You know I was being modest

848
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
I was saying you know

849
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
Even if you don't like me

850
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
What you didn't see lowest me

851
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,032
Look at these other people there truly special I mean these were people

852
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
That came out of Stanford at the end of the 70s you don't know what you got here

853
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
How many women work

854
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,552
Well not very many although we had a couple that we're doing inside sales and we had

855
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,392
My friend who is still at that point running the purchasing department

856
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
I do remember that the executive meeting

857
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,048
The head of HR who was a former Miss California and I were the only women

858
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
That this is this is another

859
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Part of the story words

860
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
A little complicated and they're obviously different versions of

861
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
What happened

862
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
Recently there was a lot of

863
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Pension

864
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
At Cisco

865
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
It seems pretty clear that

866
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
There was somebody or some group of people who wanted

867
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Who wants you out

868
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
That's right

869
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Until I guess

870
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
One day the

871
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
Your CEO John my mortgage calls you

872
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
And

873
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
What do you remember about that day

874
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
Everything

875
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
What happened

876
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,288
Are sitting in my little office in the corner as I did every day he came in and he sat down in the chair without making an appointment

877
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Mini setup

878
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
I think it's time you retire

879
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,176
That was it. You got all this money now you just

880
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Time to retire

881
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
And I said well John I'm

882
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
Not even half vested yet and I've got a lot I still think I have I'm doing here and I started

883
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
Of course my practical way to tell me what I was doing and

884
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm he practically told me to shut up

885
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
I mean basically I was fired

886
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Wait but your

887
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Sheriff

888
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
The company was going to fully vest

889
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
4 years

890
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Does a two-year

891
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Bingo

892
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
So

893
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
If you would walk out that point

894
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
I'll be walking out with half my net worth

895
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
I noticed they only fired me and not Lynn

896
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
And you could do nothing about that

897
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:17,856
You know at that point it was women don't get along they're not playing team players you know this was six months after the company IPO

898
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
So you fire one of the founders

899
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,560
And we're not getting along we did have an adjustment. Where it was

900
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Very difficult marriage was

901
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Was

902
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,936
Giving everything up for the company or health our marriage

903
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,056
You name it sounds like how you could have had a

904
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
All American

905
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
People handle stress in different ways and

906
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:47,552
They were simultaneously pandering to Lindsey go and I had no idea what had any go until then but

907
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
He got the board seat

908
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
I was literally chocolate

909
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,768
So they they very consciously tried to drive this wedge between us and

910
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Chelsea was working

911
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,656
Well except for one thing and someone like Don Valentine has no way to

912
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Really internalized

913
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
L'enfer

914
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,776
All of his things that can make him

915
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,824
Very unusual and sometimes very difficult

916
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
He is fundamentally

917
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
Fair and decent and it is in violet

918
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
And I went swimming at said

919
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Len I don't know if you know you're on the board

920
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,648
Whether you've heard about this but mortgage just fired me

921
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,256
And I looked at me and his usual way of Sonos kind of goes up one side and says

922
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
I am sure

923
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
You are mistaken

924
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Mysidewalk

925
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
I'm sure I'm not the words

926
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,728
You are fired leave the building

927
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
We're sad

928
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
And so when

929
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
I think you probably could have knocked over both Valentine and everybody else like little

930
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
Bowling pins when then walked up there and walked out

931
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,528
He walked out in solidarity with you

932
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,344
He absolutely did he walk up half of his

933
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Potentially

934
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
We ended up getting it back

935
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,768
The only because it would have looked very bad for the stock 6 months after win

936
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Both

937
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
Sounders walk out

938
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
And you can't turn feather the other one with

939
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
Girls don't know how to play on a TV

940
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
So you did manage to

941
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
Retain your 1/3 steak

942
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
With with our lawyer and

943
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Threatening

944
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
To expose a list of six months after the IP

945
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
Speaks ^

946
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Your

947
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Intellectual partnership

948
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Lynn

949
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
What's up with you

950
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
How much he

951
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Respect

952
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
You agree with you and Lynn and I

953
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
You know we respect each other as

954
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
People and

955
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,728
We adore each other and we are each other's best friend

956
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
And I should say you're no longer

957
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Married today right

958
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
That's right

959
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,224
But what's fundamentally hit with something that they could not have reckoned on and that is that there exists people in the world

960
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
Who fundamentally see black and white right and wrong

961
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
End

962
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Lennox one of those

963
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
People

964
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
That has an unerring

965
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Sense of

966
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Did they

967
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
They must have panicked

968
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
When he walked out they did

969
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
That could have

970
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Beckham son of the company

971
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
They were

972
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,496
Holy holy taking a bath they had no plan B

973
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
Sandy

974
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
Somebody

975
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,688
Who knows somebody who who's here in the story

976
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,272
And knows a little bit about it might ask you this question

977
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Witches

978
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
When you in the land walk

979
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
It's been reported

980
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
You walked out with $170

981
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Their argument Cisco's argue

982
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
You guys are now rich

983
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Just go enjoy life

984
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Enso

985
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
I mean you did have all that

986
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Money

987
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
Was any part of you like yeah right I mean

988
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
I did my job here and

989
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Okay I'll move on

990
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
You know it could have been that way had

991
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,223
The sequence of events been less brutal and less personal

992
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
They could have bought Lennon die out

993
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
We could have

994
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Kept Noah

995
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,391
Facade of a relationship that could have been done

996
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
500 ways that would have been

997
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,999
Appositives was probably time for me to go

998
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
Probably time for them to go we're just not good people

999
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
In a collaborative environment

1000
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
So you both leave the

1001
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
And

1002
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
How was your muscles

1003
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Arthur Rock

1004
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
You know my entire adult working life was tied up and everything that had been done and sacrificed in

1005
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
Built in that company

1006
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
And

1007
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,551
The people who stayed there were no longer not my friends

1008
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
The people

1009
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
For customers of them were no longer

1010
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
No not my friends

1011
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
And it was

1012
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
It was a time that

1013
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
You know any kind of

1014
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,143
Tentacle our route that I had managed to put down was just

1015
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
Forcibly ripped up

1016
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
I was on my own I had

1017
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,359
A comfortable amount of money remember that right after that linen I put 70% of the proceeds in the charitable vehicle

1018
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,199
Message does not get distributed until both of you guys are long gone right

1019
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Well yeah and and weave

1020
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
Paid out about

1021
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
50 million dollars

1022
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
And a private charity that that we've been spending since since that time so you know I had money but we're not talking about billions we're talkin

1023
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
About

1024
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,071
Attentive that you guys sold all your

1025
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
We did

1026
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,423
You're certainly people would say will you look you're crying all the way to the bank

1027
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,311
How much money can you spend how much money do you really need I'm not somebody that you know I live in a log cabin

1028
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
You know it

1029
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,687
What they had taken for me was what they meant to take from me which was

1030
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
Basically my whole working identity

1031
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
The amazing thing is you are 35 years old

1032
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Barry

1033
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
E335

1034
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
You're ousted from the company that

1035
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
You found it

1036
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
You do have

1037
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
Quite a bit of money at this point

1038
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
So what did you do

1039
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,191
You know I come from a family that believes very strongly in

1040
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
The common good

1041
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,055
I think it would great values with respect to work and

1042
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
You know I decided that

1043
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
Elmo's World was my first love

1044
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
There were five animal shelters in the Bay Area that if your pet happened across the street it could end up in a in a shelter 16

1045
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Miles away

1046
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
And they had no way

1047
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,511
To tell where your pet was in a lot of times by the time you figured it was really missing it have been Houston

1048
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
And I went across the street to the

1049
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
Animal shelter Merced you know how I have this idea for Noah

1050
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
And we can put all these animals

1051
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
Dennis Davis

1052
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,335
Be shared by all of these 5 networks that ring the day we could call it petnet

1053
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
And

1054
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
You know you guys could

1055
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Just sit there and

1056
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Your take picture the other one like typing

1057
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
If she thinks about it

1058
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,807
If people could sit at home and see if we're there animal was

1059
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
So I just started

1060
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
Working really really hard with

1061
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
Rhiannon

1062
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
On Peninsula and San Jose in the

1063
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,511
Palo Alto in the Oakland

1064
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
Oakland shelters building petnet

1065
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
You

1066
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Spent a couple years

1067
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
In the Bay Area after

1068
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
To your Asha from Cisco

1069
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,823
And then I get some 90s you started a cosmetics

1070
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
Company Urban Decay

1071
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:08,223
Which is completely like total did totally different direction right

1072
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
How did that happen

1073
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,879
My aunt whom I adored I was turning 40 and she said Hey kid it's time to lose the

1074
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,183
T-shirts and jeans and by the way up

1075
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
But you could use a little makeup

1076
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,791
I adore her and I thought she loved me and so I

1077
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
Took that to heart

1078
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,679
And I thought jeans and t-shirts were not a negotiable item so I would concentrate on the makeup

1079
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,287
And I went to go look at that and I went to the department store and it was all great if your Christie Brinkley

1080
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,127
No I don't look like Christie Brinkley and I've always been kind of a

1081
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Shipping

1082
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,247
Can Punk sort of person just cuz I don't fit in so I tend to grab

1083
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
To toward those

1084
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Fashions

1085
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
Belong to those people who

1086
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Joy not fitting in

1087
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
You know it was all pink

1088
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,791
Am I just go I can't do this for the rest of my life

1089
00:45:54,303 --> 00:46:00,447
This is not right why is your nails red well because it has to match lipstick why do you stand there and put your hands up

1090
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Fire face

1091
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,799
No your nails should maybe it was how about that one

1092
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
Rochester closed

1093
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
So

1094
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,431
Make a very easy thing you do 3 weeks we're on the Shelf in 3 months

1095
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
Nodejs

1096
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,599
Because at this point you were like I have never going to outside investor

1097
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,183
Ever so you had the money

1098
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
That's right because you could do that

1099
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
You can make it happen quickly on your terms

1100
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
What was the

1101
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
What was Urban Decay naked

1102
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,447
Well I just thought you know there's a whole market for people like me that

1103
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Really grew up in the time of

1104
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
You know Vietnam War end

1105
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,663
Hippies and punks and I was really heavy into the punxsy at that point

1106
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
Are still delayed gratification

1107
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
So

1108
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
I just started making this really cool colors

1109
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,111
Like beautiful Blues we had a

1110
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,671
Kind of a light steel blue that was called uvd

1111
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,487
We have plagued which was unkind of

1112
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Purple with a green tint

1113
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,959
Broach which was an absolutely drop-dead gorgeous Brown and we had mildew which was nice

1114
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,543
Screen

1115
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Steel color

1116
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Well

1117
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
So you were making a colors

1118
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
And giving them some interesting names

1119
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,271
And I'm really really good ingredients the first place we were in

1120
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
Nordstrom's and Neiman Marcus sell

1121
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
We were

1122
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
Using top-of-the-line ingredients and it was

1123
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Absolutely

1124
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
We committed to no animal testing

1125
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
End

1126
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Because

1127
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,375
You put your money behind it was you you were able to get a cabbage to get Nordstrom to agree to the carrier

1128
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
Because it was a really good

1129
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,519
NBA I think it was good timing because

1130
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,847
You know your type by the mid-90s enter your talk about Nirvana and you know the

1131
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
The grunge wave in

1132
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
Pearl Jam in that whole thing

1133
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,527
I think Nordstrom rightly felt that they were missing a mark so it's coming it's really cool beat

1134
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Because you

1135
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
Assertive headspin soap

1136
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Previous like two decades

1137
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Really

1138
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
Understanding learning

1139
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
Mastering

1140
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Here Technologies

1141
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
And I have to assume that you

1142
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,351
How to dive into cosmetics in the same way cuz I

1143
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
I mean did you notice really easy

1144
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,495
Eat at the base of the nail polish how much Michael you want to put in at the base for the

1145
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:16,383
The color cosmetic eyeshadow what kind of my car using how much Mica how much pigment you're putting in it

1146
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
Everybody uses the same stuff it's just

1147
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
How they put it together and what they're willing to pay

1148
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
So you say you would go to these

1149
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:30,463
Factory make that make makeup for a hundred different companies and you would tell them exactly what you wanted and we would make it

1150
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,047
You make it we would sit on the bench with the people and and make it and we had

1151
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,607
Three weeks to get it out on the Shelf before

1152
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
The same company with would knock it off for the other people on the street

1153
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,775
I mean you were and you are such a highly respected

1154
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
Technology pioneer

1155
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
And

1156
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,943
And you had all these friends in this community who did anybody ever say

1157
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
Sandy Cosmetics that's interesting that's like a total departure

1158
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,879
I wanted it to be a total departure because

1159
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
And I was I was using my technical chops for pets

1160
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
Service doing that and

1161
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Jamaica

1162
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Timmy was really

1163
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
I was quite offended by

1164
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,495
The makeup industry putting all the women in this paint box in our first our first ad for Urban Decay was just pink Nike

1165
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Puke

1166
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
You know to me it was about choice

1167
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,919
I guess you too jealous trait like how kind of pump

1168
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
Urban Decay Vice

1169
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
I've read that

1170
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Dennis Rodman

1171
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:32,927
Play The Cure The Cure Houston X Gwen Stefani you stood I mean we had a we had

1172
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
A whole lot of people

1173
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
Who are using our makeup

1174
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,839
So what why did you I mean it was like five years

1175
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
After you launch Urban Decay that you sold it

1176
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
Chewed lvmh

1177
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Copy that

1178
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Vintage Louis Vuitton

1179
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Why

1180
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,871
For the simple reason that there's no intellectual property

1181
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
You can't cut and color

1182
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
Right

1183
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
Like other companies

1184
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Cookie keep knocking you off she just

1185
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
What you just figured

1186
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Clematis

1187
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Yeah

1188
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
Was it worth the price was it worth selling

1189
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,719
I'm funny bunny

1190
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
But by the way I think is not owned by L'Oreal

1191
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
LA right now

1192
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,727
But still you know you started this company is

1193
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,799
Probably cool to see this around me still rap solutely

1194
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
To you

1195
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,175
Have this entirely other part of your life which is

1196
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
Arguably the biggest part of the Chalet food

1197
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,527
Now which is a

1198
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
A sustainable

1199
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,111
Farm in Virginia

1200
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
Complete left the West Coast

1201
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Build your

1202
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Life

1203
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
In the Virginia Countryside

1204
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Were you raised

1205
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Rare

1206
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,839
Breeds of

1207
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
Cattle end

1208
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Pigs and chickens

1209
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
And Turkish in Turkey

1210
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Tell me

1211
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Tell me about that had them start

1212
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,615
I was raised on a farm and I believe in eating me I mean we got this pointy teeth right

1213
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
That's why we survive the Ice Age

1214
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
But you don't

1215
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,527
The idea that you would factory farm to me was

1216
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Beyond horrifying

1217
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,927
And I absolutely believe that we did not use that kind of farming when I grow up reformed

1218
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,231
Play my grandfather knew how to farm which was

1219
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,559
Seminar on the shield and you fed your cows good things in at the end of the time

1220
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,423
You can't fit your neighbor I mean we would know more of poison dark house because we have poisoned our neighbors at that point

1221
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,519
So I was convinced that I could find an economic model

1222
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Because I have the resources

1223
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
To raise large livestock

1224
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Possibly

1225
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
In a sustainable

1226
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
OrganiCann cumin powder

1227
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
And I am

1228
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,807
Imagine

1229
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,855
Like doing this kind of farming is hard

1230
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,975
You know I'm one of those people that doesn't have I guess the Good Sense God gave it actor

1231
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
To just

1232
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:48,095
Not do something because it's going to take a whole lot of hard work from you is the hardest thing I've ever done

1233
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
Much much higher than

1234
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,447
Learning calculus is a graduate student in

1235
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Dinner

1236
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
Physics and the rest of all of that stuff

1237
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,615
It's it's it's much much much harder than anything I've done and it takes

1238
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
More work

1239
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,479
And more heartache and more aggravation than you can ever

1240
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Imagine

1241
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
Something web

1242
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,719
That is really striking to me is that you and you still have this partnership with land likely even though you haven't

1243
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Married since

1244
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Like the 90s

1245
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
You still

1246
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Collaborate together

1247
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,423
Clearly like you still value each other tremendously

1248
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,799
Yeah and our foundation is called the Ampersand Foundation because it stands for Len and Sandy

1249
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Oh that's so cool

1250
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,711
Can we both have put our money into matter what we do with our personalized the rest of our lives we are each other's legatee

1251
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Yeah

1252
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,575
But you know that land and I found each other because we

1253
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
Probably

1254
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,927
We're more suited to each other than

1255
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
Most everybody else in the planet

1256
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
You know my parents

1257
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,071
Thought when was A Space Alien

1258
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
Until until they fix my uncle's chainsaw

1259
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Then he was like the Golden Boy

1260
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
But my parents Allen's parents met each other for the first time I think they were each expecting sort of like ET and and why

1261
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
You know because

1262
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Both of their children were so bizarre

1263
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,503
You know it was it was a little a little touchy there for a while

1264
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
I know you've been asked this before.

1265
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
Hitachi questions I want to ask you anyway

1266
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,207
You have been able to do

1267
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
Anyting

1268
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
He wanted to do

1269
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Giving away

1270
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
So much of your wealth

1271
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,655
Add yuan Len

1272
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
App that stalk you

1273
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
Would have been it would have been worth

1274
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
50

1275
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Maybe more Billy

1276
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,871
Jealous time I checked I think I would have been been worth 9 billion but it's

1277
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
It's probably gone up since then

1278
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
You know I think that

1279
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
Nobody can see the future

1280
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
And that Lennon died

1281
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
Agreed to sell our stock

1282
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,255
On a very joint basis and we did it because we fundamentally had no respect for people running the company

1283
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Don't it wasn't really that

1284
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
We didn't believe in the

1285
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,167
Company I mean I was the one who said that Cisco would be a billion dollar company and I knew that that was

1286
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,983
As long as his people stay there even without me and Lynn

1287
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
They had a technology Legacy

1288
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
That they would be successful

1289
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,895
It was because lenin i did not wish to live our lives

1290
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,711
With those people having any more control

1291
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Over

1292
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
RJ

1293
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,807
It had nothing to do with

1294
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
With financial

1295
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:24,767
We made a pile of money and it really had nothing to do with you no Roi or not any rights and you know

1296
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
What tech company was going to do it had to do with the quality of my life

1297
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,911
And how we wanted to to look at the morning

1298
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,799
How much of your of your success to you a tribute to

1299
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
Your intelligence in your hard work and how much

1300
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
YouTube YouTube

1301
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,271
Yeah I've always said that it's a third being smarter third working hard on her third luck

1302
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
No

1303
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Take that back

1304
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
It's a half being smarter

1305
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
Half working harder and 1/2

1306
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,743
Sherlock because that adds up to more than one

1307
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
And there were times

1308
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,607
That Cisco could have just been

1309
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
An asterisk

1310
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,775
I mean there was so many times that company could have gone under and we were saved by circumstances

1311
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Out of our control

1312
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
So there was huge luck in there

1313
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
I still work harder than anybody I know

1314
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
That's my great gift

1315
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
And I love work

1316
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,063
I'm I'm I'm besotted with work

1317
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,671
You nobody already designed my Epitaph it has one word on it

1318
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
What do you think it is

1319
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,559
One word wow that's done word

1320
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
I can't some your

1321
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
I can't

1322
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,935
Summarize your life into one words that

1323
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983

Sandy Lerner co-founder of

1327
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,503
Cisco Systems and founder of Urban Decay makeup

1328
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,135
By the way Sandy did guess right when she once predicted that Cisco was going to be a

1329
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
Billion dollar company

1330
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,463
It is now more like eight

200

1332
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
Billion dollar company

1333
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
Addition to running are sure farm and running as restaurant Sandy also started a library in the UK

1334
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
The Chawton house Library

1335
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,055
Which contains thousands of books written by female authors

1336
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
Around the time of Jane Austen

00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
In fact a few years ago

1356

Time now for how you built that and

1357
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,975
Play Story begins

1358
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
About

1359
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,607
Seven years ago outside San Diego literally on a Manhunt

1360
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
We were searching for an armed suspect

1361
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
Mission was tough

1362
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:18,079
The suspect was even tougher

1363
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,663
The time and the people chasing that suspect in the

1364
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:26,527
California desert it was incredibly hot 100 degrees is really hot if your in San Diego

1365
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:31,647
And about 40 lbs of gear

1366
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,255
And Justin kept thinking there has to be a better way to stay cool out here

1367
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,327
No he didn't know much about design or engineering but

1368
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,143
I got home he called up a friend

1369
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
Who did oh yes JD is a management science and engineering major from Stanford

1370
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
Back around a bunch of different ideas

1371
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
And after a few years

1372
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
They eventually designed a piece of

1373
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,015
Clothing that could keep someone comfortable in hot

1374
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Or cold weather

1375
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
It's just a

1376
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:06,207
Compression base layer shirt that would look a lot like a Nike or an Under Armour shirt that somebody might buy at Dick's Sporting Goods

1377
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
But it had unique Pockets that

1378
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
Could hold Heating and Cooling elements

1379
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,351
Haidian

1380
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
Put it up on Kickstarter

1381
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
30 weeks later the phone rang

1382
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
It was actually the US Army

1383
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:24,639
The Army has been looking for a way to keep soldiers cool and they said the Justin hate we love the shirt but

1384
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
Can you make it stay cooler

1385
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
For longer

1386
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,039
One way that we we put it as we built a scalpel for athletes

1387
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
And they asked us to build a sledgehammer for soldiers

1388
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,415
But how were they going to build that sledgehammer

1389
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
Well Justin and JD were stock for several weeks

1390
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
And then

1391
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,375
I was having drinks with a few friends that I just come home from Afghanistan

1392
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
Remarks that are

1393
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,079
That was on Kickstarter reminded them of how they try to stay cool overseas which was they freeze bottled water

1394
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
And then they jamming in their body armor

1395
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,735
And that is when I had the lightbulb moment of o

1396
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,319
Justin's light bulb moment was maybe I could create a

1397
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,135
Frozen water bottle that you could strap

1398
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,183
Directly to your body like a

1399
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
Flat plate of armor

1400
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Well

1401
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,815
That's exactly what JD and Justin came up with

1402
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,863
The way it works is You Phillip

1403
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
With drinking water

1404
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,935
Do you freeze it overnight

1405
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
And then you wear it

1406
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,543
And as your body heat melts the ice

1407
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,079
You have cold water to drink

1408
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,895
JT and Justin called it the ice plate

1409
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,711
And it made it so we could stay cold for like

1410
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
2 to 4 hours

1411
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,551
It took it back to the Army to pitch it

1412
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,111
But okay this is the Army right so

1413
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,415
It turned out it was going to take years

1414
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:45,791
The deal with all the military red tape before Justin and JD could actually get a contract

1415
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
And we just

1416
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,631
I knew that we were going to be able to go broke

1417
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,727
So we took it to the commercial Market in August of 2016 but

1418
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
They start to get some pushback

1419
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
Negative pushback from the market

1420
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:03,199
It'll never work that's a dumb idea there was every objection to some people just didn't get it right away

1421
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,855
And we were just like oh my gosh that we just made the biggest mistake of our lives but just a few weeks

1422
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,391
After they launch the ice place

1423
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Their luck

1424
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,951
Completely changed

1425
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,023
September 2016 we got a live chat

1426
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
From a gentleman named Kevin Frye

1427
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,887
Who work for Chick-fil-A at the time

1428
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:27,263
Chick-fil-A happened to be looking for a better way to keep their outdoor employees

1429
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,311
Cool on hot summer days

1430
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,919
So Chick-fil-A now uses the ice plates at about 200 of their stores

1431
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,223
So we we can busy

1432
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,039
And since they launched their company two years ago

1433
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,831
Justin and JD have sold

1434
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,159
About 20000 units to law enforcement

1435
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,719
Ted construction workers even to the Secret Service

1436
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
This is the most fun I could have

1437
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:55,935
Ever dreamed of having its nerdy engineering stuff it's helping the men and women who protect our country inn

1438
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:01,567
Communities it is so much fun I could have designed a job this much fun if I try

1439
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
Justin Lee's company is called

1440
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Performance it's based in

1441
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,991
