1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:09,216
Invited me to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in Dallas and said this is going to work out here driving

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:15,616
Everybody is saying in this company and reach across the table and held my hands and I was crying and

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,736
Everybody even your even the people that your biggest supporter said I thought you had to go

4
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
Running PR

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
How I built this

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
Show that innovators

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Entrepreneurs

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Heelys

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Stories

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Airline travel

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,848
And again and again

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
To create one of the most

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
Innovative carriers

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Us

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
JetBlue

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
So few days ago

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
I flew on a

18
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
Budget Airline

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
What's public radio guys

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Anyway

21
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
Pictures of shorts

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Flight so no big deal I know what to expect

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Non-refundable tickets

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Middle seat in the

25
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Back of the plane

26
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Iboard last

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
No recline no legroom no TV no snacks

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Print my ticket out at home

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
It's fine that's a trade-off

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
As long as I get to where I need to go safely

31
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
I'm more or less fine

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
But once in awhile

33
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,344
The route I'm taking is one that JetBlue flies and the prices the same

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
And with that ticket

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
I get a seat that does recline

36
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
A snack

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Beverage

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Really nice flight attendants

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
TV

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
Which is why wouldn't JetBlue debuted in 2000

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
It made such

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
A big impact

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
It was a discount carrier that

44
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
Albertsstuff the most premium Airlines were already off

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Or in some cases not offering

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Customers noticed pretty fat

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
In less than a year

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
JetBlue flew more than a million passengers

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,856
And quickly built a super loyal following

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
And that was the vision of JetBlue's founder

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
David neeleman

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
To build a more Humane Airline

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
But the thing is

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
David's passion for a better flying experience

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Actually came from his own background

56
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
His own face

57
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
David's family is Mormon in the Mormon faith emphasizes civility

58
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:26,176
Every practicing Mormon is encouraged to go on a mission when they're in their late

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Teens or early twenties

60
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
Back in the 1950s

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
David's father was sent

62
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
A missionary trip

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Brazil

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
He loved it so much

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
He went back as a journalist and started a family

66
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,792
Which is why David was born in Sao Paulo in 19

67
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
59

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680
David's dad move the family back to Salt Lake City

69
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,776
Where was just going to baked in the everyday life

70
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
I was in a pretty conservative place I mean it was obviously a place that was

71
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Was founded by

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Brigham Young

73
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,016
And as they started the church they moved across

74
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
The Country Inn

75
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
My mom said the family were

76
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
We're Pioneers they came in covered wagons

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
My grandmother Seven Generations back

78
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
A lady by the name of Sally Hewlett

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,376
The family stories that she was giving a book of Mormon by Joseph Smith himself who's the founder of the

80
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Heart urchin

81
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,496
And a lot of people have those stories Mei most everyone you

82
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,616
You mean it's all like has a story of somebody who either cross the plains across the ocean

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,944
You know how to grandmother died on the plane to his just kind of that

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,040
Part of our laurelville religion and end these Pioneer families

85
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
We're entrepreneurial in any way but did you lie

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
What cars are

87
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
What black dogs running like that

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
My grandfather had a few grocery stores

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Small grocery stores you call the Miniature Market

90
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
We're like fast food

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
And we should make the sandwiches in the back and bring it fresh donuts

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
You're kind of a precursor to maybe a 7-Eleven but everything was done fresh

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
So when I was 9 years old I got a job there

94
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Standing on a milk

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Crate

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
Working the cash register checking out people you know counting money

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
So that was kind of my introduction to business in my

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
My grandfather was a really

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
That was so he was born in Salt Lake but his whole family came from Holland

100
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
And so you know he paid me $0.50 an hour which kind of made me mad cuz everyone else made a dollar an hour

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
He expected more out of me than the other kids and

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
He was really f*** son customer service if somebody

103
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,431
If there was something in the store that somebody wanted and we didn't have it he'd run out the back door and run over to Safeway and buy it and bring it back

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Yeah he was

105
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
He never wanted to lose a customer

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
I look back on those years and I didn't get to participate as much

107
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
In high school in

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Things of sports

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Just maybe as I would have

110
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Wanted to do but

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
You know I think it probably taught me alot

112
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
About a lot of things

113
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
What's Church

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
A Big Sur Center of life for you as a

115
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Kids are going to

116
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
Going to services and going on Sunday

117
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Things like that

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
Ya always was I mean it was 3 hours on a Sunday and

119
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
It's a cultural thing you know I think as much as a religious thing so you have both elements

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
I need to know your neighbors you

121
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Document

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Church on Sunday you have boundary areas

123
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
In our church where

124
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,719
If you lived in a certain geographical area and then you have to go at this church at this time

125
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
And when it was

126
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
My time to serve a mission there wasn't even a question

127
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
I'm going to go on a mission just like

128
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
My dad did

129
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
How are you as a student

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Fargo

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
I was

132
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
You know it's not that for lack of

133
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Not wanting to be I just

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
It was something I'd I discovered later in life

135
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271
But I had a raging case of ADD and I know everyone likes to say they do today but

136
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
It was really something that

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
That was tough for me because I

138
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Yeah I was

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
I was gregarious in and I could get my way through things but I couldn't read

140
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
It was really hard for me to read and

141
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
Yeah I would read a page in a book and I could tell you everything that I thought about why was reading that page except for

142
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
I was on that page you couldn't

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Now he's really Harden

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,431
If you asked me today what was my favorite book I read Highschool I couldn't tell you cuz I don't recall even reading a single book in high

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Yeah I got through it

146
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
Yeah with pretty decent grades but

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Did horribly on the ACT I think I

148
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
I got like an 18 or something

149
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
And I think my reading was

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Below 10

151
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
My counselor said I don't know how you got to score the slow had you just marked C on every answer you have gotten a higher score

152
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
Score

153
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
So he tried to get the lowest score possible

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
And this is what I learned about add afterwards

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
If it was something I was interested in I would devour

156
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
Play services something that I wasn't interested in ideas

157
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Couldn't focus on

158
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
It was really hard

159
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
This is it this is life

160
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
The 70s

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
People weren't really diagnosing add it wasn't like a

162
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
The common saying

163
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
That people talk about

164
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,767
Now it wasn't and it wasn't until years later

165
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
When my little brother

166
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Have a little brother that

167
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Guitar

168
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Is 18 years younger than I am I'm almost nineteen years

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
That he was diagnosed with it

170
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
And that my mom

171
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
To read this book called driven to distraction

172
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
By dr. Hallowell

173
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
And my mom sent me the book and she said you know marks has been diagnosed

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
With this

175
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
I think

176
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
You might have this

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Hand

178
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
It was the night of course didn't read the book

179
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
But I did read there was there was 21

180
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Characteristics of somebody

181
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Who has ADD

182
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
And I read those 21 things and I just put

183
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
The book down and I just like got tears in my eyes and I all wow this is

184
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Me

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
I guess you were you were 19 when you went on your

186
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Commission for the church

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
Basically you are assigned

188
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
To a country

189
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
You go and and do Mission work right

190
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Cracks and I was so fortunate

191
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
To be to be assigned to Brazil and I think part of the reason

192
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
Is because I was born there and I had a Brazilian fast

193
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
What's out

194
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
It was just

195
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
It just kind of

196
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Random

197
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
He's put it in and

198
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,447
You receive your call and your call says you're going to be going to Brazil

199
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
What was your impression of it I mean what

200
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
What should I tell you when you got there

201
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,407
Yeah I've been there several times and I was

202
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
But my dad being a journalist and being a

203
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Foreign cars

204
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,111
Responding and he knew all the Rich and Famous and so every time we would go visit Brazil

205
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,975
We were hanging up sports clubs or hang out at the beach we're going to the best restaurants in

206
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,815
Everything was just like wow Brazil is a cool place everything's so amazing

207
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
But you know what your missionary you don't hang out with those rich people

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Divarty

209
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:45,311
Got their God do you know that it's their money or yellow or whatever they don't they're not helpful enough to

210
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,407
Change it's really the people that are really downtrodden really down on their luck

211
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
Does it have virtually nothing that listen to your message and so

212
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
I spent all my time with those people and end

213
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Wow

214
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
It was an eye-opener for me

215
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
You obviously in in United States

216
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
We have disparity of income in classes but

217
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
At least you have an ability to move from one class to another

218
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
If you work hard and you're lucky I know you have some blocking you know you do

219
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,543
Certain things you have student loans and other things in Brazil it's virtually impossible to do that

220
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
And it made me very resentful

221
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
And you know I really

222
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
Ended up yeah I got tucked away in my mind

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
Did I win if I wanted to come back to Brazil

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
And I wanted to do something

225
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
How to help these people

226
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
At some point time in my life and kind of make my conch

227
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Tribution

228
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,767
And did you cuz I'm just tryna remember my experiencing

229
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Young young missionaries

230
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
What did you wear

231
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
A black tie in a white shirt and like around on a bike

232
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,495
Just like the guys in the play in New York City

233
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
We didn't have a bike but we had white shirts

234
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Mens short sleeve white shirt

235
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
You're just a tide at DeSoto black tie and slacks

236
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
But I also I was very successful in

237
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
I'm kind of being a leader in the first time I had ever done that

238
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
And then

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,463
Also just learning disciplining and kind of overcoming my ADD

240
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
Being able to read scriptures in to learn a language in

241
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
When I came back from a mission

242
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
I was able to

243
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
Go back to the University Inn

244
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,263
Where I left getting seasoned he's I was home getting straight A's

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Well

246
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Yeah it made me I grew up a lot in it

247
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
They taught me discipline which is something that

248
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
I have learned in my

249
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
And my childhood because of my ADD

250
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
It might be kind of a stretch but

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
Means something like a weird way

252
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
It's almost as if

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Your experience as a missionary

254
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
You are essentially pitching

255
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Something to eat

256
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
If you're pitching and in this

257
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Taste the word of God right

258
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
You're pitching

259
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Your face

260
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
And you're trying to convince people

261
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
About

262
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
What it's done for you and how it's

263
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Fulfilled your life

264
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
It's like business writing your pitching

265
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Something you believe in

266
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Yeah I mean it

267
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
There's a lot of companies that are in Provo Utah

268
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
Did you door-to-door sales of alarm systems

269
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
Pest control and whatever

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
And got to take all these

271
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Please Kaiser come in Galveston from over missions

272
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
They're kind of fearless now

273
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
And then they said go sell alarm system ago sell Pest Control

274
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
Some people go out for the summer and make $50,000

275
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
I just

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,079
They are selling pest control or selling alarm systems door to door

277
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
So when you got back to

278
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
To the US

279
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Were you were you single at the time

280
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
I was

281
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
And you got married right away and start having kids

282
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
Went to work when you were in college

283
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Yeah

284
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Yeah it's kind of

285
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
At what you do you know it's

286
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,279
The way it works at the church you get home and you're encouraged to get married and

287
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
We got married in December and our first child was born on November 1st so

288
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Academy 11 months later

289
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
And it was just kind of Off to the Races from there

290
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
When you are on when you got back

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Started up a college again

292
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
University of Utah

293
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Rickettsias you start a business

294
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
As mobile

295
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
I did I was

296
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Sitting in my accounting class

297
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Sunday in

298
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
How is

299
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,231
Talking to someone who's sitting behind me and her name is Lily Rowe nags to remember

300
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
And

301
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
How she told me about this

302
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Guy who who

303
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
This man who is a friend of her mother's

304
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
That own some timeshares

305
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
In Hawaii at this place called the Imperial Hawaii Resort

306
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
And he was having difficulty selling the timeshares

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
And so

308
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,015
I got this idea to go talk to him I said give me his name and I'll call him up in his name was a Libra and so

309
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
I called him up and I went down to meet with him and I said

310
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
Hey how about if I just rent your timeshares out cuz he was paying a weekly maintenance fee on all of them it was kind of drain

311
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
Let me let me feel him up and he said ok

312
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
So I under the resort accommodation section of the local newspaper

313
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
For the time

314
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
I would just run little one.

315
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
Say hey Hawaii condo for

316
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
$75 a night

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Or whatever 50 bucks a night

318
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Sleep

319
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
6 and so I start getting phone calls

320
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
Batman I booked them

321
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
And I

322
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,111
That pay him hundred thirty-five bucks I'd collect four hundred bucks an hour to keep the different suck it was

323
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
I was doing a couple of hours a day and next thing you know

324
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,999
I was making some pretty good money just filling up these

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Condominiums in

326
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,167
And then I started getting other ones and one day I heard about an airline it was right after deregulation

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,311
It's like the early 80s 78 was deregulation so the airlines that was kind of sprouting up

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
So there was an airline call Pacific East

329
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
And I called the guy that was running it

330
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
In LA and I said hey

331
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,015

332
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551

I would packaging with these hotels and then I would save

00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
299 yuan

00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
Fly to Hawaii but you got to drive to La Sophie

339
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
People tell I wheel of Hawaii

340
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
Yeah you tons of always love to why so they jump in the cars in the drive down to LA

00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Hop on this

342
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
Pacific East old dc-8 and fly over to Hawaii

343
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
You did this while you were a college student you just like

344
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Create package holidays

345
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Four people yeah that's how I did it then

346
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
I bet she dropped out of college

347
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
He's doing

348
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
6 million dollars a year

349
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
6 million dollars a year

350
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
Yeah and it was

351
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767
I had that all staff of people and we were

352
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
Sales people people to come in and sit down with your own brochures of different

353
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
Hotels that we had or different condo cuz then I would call it over to other places and say hey can I buy a block of rooms

354
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
For twenty bucks at night that's okay and so I just started packaging him

355
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
That was all working well until

356
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
There was

357
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
I have a new airline to started

358
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
And I was old enamored with this because it was Hawaii

359
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
Express and had a big pineapple on the tail and they flew 747

360
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
So I said why would I switch to these guys

361
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
So I started buying tickets from them

362
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
And then right before Christmas

363
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
It was 1982

364
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Maybe 93

365
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
They called me up and said you know what they were ceasing operations tomorrow

366
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Tomorrow they said well

367
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
We don't have any money and I said my prepaid all these people is right before Christmas

368
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
People pay for the hotels by no way of getting mobile all across all the airplane tickets were full I didn't have money to send everybody over there and so

369
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
It was

370
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:28,511
Kind of a disastrous time and I learned a huge lesson from that bit suited me well through the years but

371
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
It was obviously very difficult to go from

372
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,191
A point where I had this thriving business to for Monday the next I purchase it had nothing

373
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Wait that

374
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
That white business out

375
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
It did because I had prepaid you know every single ticket

376
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
And it was about a half a million dollars

377
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
And

378
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Yeah I probably had

379
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
Yeah couple hundred thousand that I have my own money in

380
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
And I should have at the time just called everybody I'm said like I can just give you half your money back

381
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
Of course you know you file for bankruptcy not personally but it was the business in

382
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
And then that you know their lawyers and get it getting most everything so

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
I was

384
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Have the time I was

385
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
In my early twenties I name is 20

386
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,543
23 or 24 slide that I really didn't know anything about business or

387
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
How does zelle work

388
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
See you were like a living you were probably like

389
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Like thinking

390
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
I'm sad like this is going to be

391
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,623
Yeah I was I went out and bought myself a BMW thought I was

392
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,719
See how things were great and I never I never bought another one again after that

393
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
I learned my lesson

394
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,167
Yeah you're young things are coming easy it's good the money I make imagine you your first condo

395
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
You sell you get mix Ram

00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
50 bucks on it

397
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Ask me for

398
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
2 weeks

399
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Just that one cell that one phone call

400
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
So

401
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
It started up fast it

402
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
Was very successful and then boom

403
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Collapse

404
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Collapse

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
So you are a College Dropout

406
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
With a failed business

407
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
And by that point you had at least one kid I guess

408
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Two kids by the ndk

409
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
So

410
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
What did you what did you do what you do for work

411
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,447
Well my father-in-law had it drapery business

412
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,055
And I was kind of working the backroom kind of doing the county and stuff

413
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
So I went back to doing that

414
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,199
Am I grant my grandfather's grocery store I went back to work how many grandfathers doors

415
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247

00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
No I didn't I lost the milk

418
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Trey Teddy could stand up

419
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
The cash register

420
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
But yeah

Get out of bed do anything but yeah I just kind of like

423
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
Said I got to keep going and so

424
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
And then I got a call from

425
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
My my uncle Stan

426
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Who just happened to be

427
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
The

428
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
State lawyer for

429
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
The Morris family

430
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Ajuna Mitch Morris

431
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,247
And June ran over successful Travel Agency in Salt Lake City it was

432
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Dealing with mainly corporate travel

433
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
At the time

434
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
So I called up and said June Morris

435
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
To talk to you

436
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,255
About doing some of the things that you were doing on your own for her company

437
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
She was older than me

438
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Oh yeah

439
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
She's about the age of my parrot

440
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
And so we sat down

441
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
And she gave me a big smile and she said yeah right

442
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
If you come to work for me I'll make sure you get a piece of the company

443
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
You know you would we can do this together and

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,967
And I really liked what you did and so she convinced me

445
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
She convinced me to do that and so I

446
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Kept the job at the store at night

447
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
I would go there during the day

448
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
And and

449
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
Call dipaulo's hotels and said hey

450
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
I'm back

451
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
I know I called up Hawaiian Airlines that I had this

452
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Contract in my drawer

453
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
I'm at my Mio law office

454
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
It was a tie Charter contract to fly at

455
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Hawaiian Airlines

456
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Charter

457
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
From Hawaii to Salt Lake directly

458
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
Bypassing the drive to LA

459
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
And I just didn't have I was just getting together the bond my new the $250,000 Bond cuz was a public charter

460
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
And I was just trying to arrange that when the other Airline failed

461
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,743
So I went back to the drawer I got the contract out I went to June and I said if Mitch

462
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
Your husband can can help with this Bond

463
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
We can launch these flights

464
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,191
It's directly from Salt Lake City Hawaiian Airlines flight direct from Salt Lake

465
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
To Honolulu or wherever

466
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
Yeah it was a it was a what we call the reverse rotation that plane wood

467
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
On a Friday night would start in Honolulu and it fly nonstop to Salt Lake and then it would turn around Saturday morning and fly back

468
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
So that was the fly it's been

469
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
Yeah basically seven days six nights in Hawaii

470
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
And then

471
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Play directing the whole package was 399

472
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Cuz we were buying the charter flight until we started this company called Morris are Charters and that was kind of the Hallmark of our of our trip

473
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Was this DCA that would it would make this trip

474
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,543
And so Hawaiian called me after one season and said hey Des Plaines going to be going back

475
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
In about 6 months

476
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Can we come and face the plane in Salt Lake

477
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
Until you can fly straight to Hawaii and back but

478
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
For the other six days a week is there anything you want to do it this airplane

479
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
And I said yeah I want to fly to La you know there's a lots of lots of Mormons in LA and and lots of family interest between the

480
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
The to my grandparents were there and

481
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Yeah I kind of spent

482
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:21,119
My whole life in the back seat in a back of a station wagon driving Death Valley

483
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Between Salt Lake in LA and I thought

484
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
If I could sell those tickets for cheap and I had

485
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
Read up a lot on Southwest Airlines

486
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
You heard was my hotel who is my was my hero and I had read every

487
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,247
Annual report ever on those guys it was kind of my dream to to be like them so

488
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,855
I put lights on to Los Angeles for $69 using this old airplane

489
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,439
Fly in the Old West Imperial terminal

490
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
Parked in Salt Lake for 6 days a week

491
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Is going to Honolulu once a week

492
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Nintendo's and they said look you can

493
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Listas from us

494
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
Do whatever you want with it for her for those are the days

495
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Right

496
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
So I said let's fight a lie 3 days

497
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
And so we ran an ad in the newspaper

498
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
And the first day I didn't give me calls and then

499
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
I'm never coming in

500
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
The next day at work

501
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
And I heard verlo who is our receptionist sing

502
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
I have

503
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
24 Los Angeles

504
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,952
Calls on hold somebody please help me

505
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,352
I would rather go there and start answering the phones myself and booking people on piece of paper in

506
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,240
It was funny cuz there was a glitch in the system so we were basically overbooking every flight by a hundred people

507
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
Bucking everyone

508
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
We we lost we're getting money on that but

509
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
You know it was

510
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
It was a

511
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
It kind of a big success from the very get-go

512
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Set up a travel agency

513
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,832
Which kind of focused on package tours

514
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
Chartering planes

515
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
But then you become you said you be coming

516
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
Airline did you and June to Dad's you ever sit down June is a hake

517
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,120
Let's become an airline or did it just isn't going to happen that way

518
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,264
Well it was about that time that Steve Harvey who's a well-known entrepreneur and the aircraft leasing business

519
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
He called up and said hey

I will miss you but I want you to get your own airplane seat

523
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
At this point this is what like a t

524
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Mid 80s

525
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184

Call me a bracelet and said you got a little something for me to do I'm still here so

541
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
But he did

542
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
20 desertification and end

543
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
And June was really funny

544
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,056
She she wanted to compass rose on the tail cuz that was logo of her travel business

545
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
They put a compass rose and then she wanted it

546
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
To be magenta

547
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
That was her color

548
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,016
Until we made these planes are the Blue towel with the magenta comforter

549
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
It was called Morris air

550
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Google Finance

551
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,208
Did did did June Morris and her husband finances did you get investors to

552
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Cuz you're the

553
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
High Plains

554
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
At least them

555
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,936
Initially we were just making a cash flow we were just using that and you know you aren't buying airplanes you just

556
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
You agreed to pay them like a monthly rent payment on the airplane

557
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
With Leasing and then

558
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
They take

559
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,456
Can certain amount per hour in reserves for maintenance and then when the plane's going for maintenance so use that money to do it

560
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Lights out

561
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
It doesn't require a lot of capital

562
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,416
From the very beginning and so we were we were just kind of bootstrapping it and that's why we got Mitch was really funny though cuz

563
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
During those years we were making money

564
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Which was in a Marlin

565
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Image was butcher

566
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,632
Yeah he was really a great guy one of the most

567
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Amazing man I've ever met he was a great mentor

568
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
But it's okay to smoke weed and do guys

569
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
We're going to do 1/3 2/3 and 1/3

570
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
There's going to the government

571
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Third Estate in the company

572
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
And a third is going to be Whiskey Drinking

573
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
Antar whiskey Drinkin by

574
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,624
So it's okay cuz I was our return for what we distributed so

575
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
So when one year I got my

576
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
I was in my

577
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,024
Maybe 26 or 27 and I got my

578
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
Whiskey Drinking money and it was enough for me to pay off my house

579
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
How do I win

580
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
The first thing I did is I went down to the bank

581
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Where am I

582
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Family had done business forever

583
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
And yeah we're this Banker was kind of

584
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,712
Knowing that my dad was always use always cover my dad's overdraft tracks of my grandpa's overdraft

585
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Jack's

586
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,808
Kind of nudity Disneyland Mancino didn't have a lot of money

587
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Since I walked in there with

588
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,184
I thought he was $165,000 check and I said I just want to pay off my house

589
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Baumann

590
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
He said okay

591
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Detective took the money

592
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
Until 8 by time I got back

593
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
To the office

594
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
June called me in and said hey

595
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Your Banker called and said

596
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
That headed to inform you this but someone in your company is embezzling money

597
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Oh she's got the biggest kick out of that so

598
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,016
I went back and closed my account and moved on to another

599
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Bertha is

600
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
Could imagine that somebody that my age

601
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Kind of an element

602
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,720
Hetalia always hard-working people but didn't have that kind of money

603
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
We could walk in and pay off their house when they were in their midst

604
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
20

605
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
And then just

606
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
A few years after you launch Morris air

607
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Southwest

608
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,240
In 1993 buys the company for $130

609
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
I mean

610
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
What's been incredible

611
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
Tutu did the debate happen

612
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
What happened a couple of

613
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
You know I really care about things happening around that time

614
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
I idolise software

615
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
And yeah I kind of

616
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
I just like

617
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
Dairy I can't even tell you how I felt about that company

618
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,792
You know Kim and when I was still out with pattern everything we did after

619
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Southwest

620
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,472
There was a few things that we did it more Sarah that Southwest wasn't doing one of them is that we invented e-ticket rap

621
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
I mean the first ticklish travel was done at

622
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
In the world

623
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,200
And it all came about because a guy who works at the timing Stewart Thatcher came into my office

624
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
Yeah you know I just went up to the

625
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,320
4th floor we have like 50 people up there

626
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
Printing tickets and stuffing them and mailing them out

627
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,976
Why don't we just come up with a computer-driven form that we can just

628
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,536
Go through it you know automatically

629
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,120
Gets that has a confirmation on Marana weed smell people that weigh weed

630
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Six of their confirmation

631
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,752
Why don't we just give it to him over the phone and why do we have to mail a manything

632
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
Cuz well people will have some in their hands

633
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,616
Let's get a fax number we can still mail it to him

634
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
But we don't really need it at the airport

635
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
Rental cars don't have it and

636
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,808
Until we didn't have a repository for that information so I had to

637
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,672
A young guy that was back it up the computers and he kept telling me he could ride it to New reservation system

638
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
So I said

639
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Why don't you

640
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Redis reservation system

641
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
And he said

642
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
I don't know if I can do it and I said well

643
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll give you $20,000

644
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
And you can buy yourself a Jeep

645
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
If you can do it

646
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Until

647
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
He he went out and

648
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
And

649
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Rought the system

650
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
And got it all done and we were we launched

651
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
The same as the first e ticket Airline

652
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:37,344
What's Southwest didn't know what a great thing they were buying that was really kind of the best thing that they were buying from that

653
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
They were

654
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
And have credit today in the Smithsonian is being the

655
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
First ticketless Airline

656
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
It was really our system that did it

657
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
But I'm going back to a bit so

658
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,008
Herb called me up and and you know said hey you know I hear you might be interested in selling and then

659
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Tell her you're

660
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Your Idol

661
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,896
Yeah I can believe it when he's on the phone I can still remember hearing his voice I like

662
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Iherb

663
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
How would you like to come down me with this

664
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
And so I went down and out with them and

665
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Smoke Filled Room with all these guys in there that I had idolized over all the years

666
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,440
And then I felt then I came home and then we found out that you had

667
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm a very serious form of cancer

668
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
It was called inflammatory breast cancer

669
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
So I went in my office

670
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,936
And I was just sitting there staring at my phone and it rang and I pick it up

671
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
And it was a guy named Jim Weichert

672
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
And I was

673
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
He said how you doing I go

674
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
He is a guy with Charter planes from

675
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
My son is sick I just found out June has

676
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Is terminal breast cancer

677
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Inflammatory breast cancer know what

678
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
What I'm going to do

679
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
And he said

680
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Gator on airplane now

681
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
And I said what do you mean

682
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
She scheduled for surgery no no don't let her have the surgery

683
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,280
We know this doctor blumenshine that

684
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Is is

685
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Is cavi amazing success with this

686
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,472
So I called up June I said June I just booked your ticket on American Airlines you need to get on there

687
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,568
So she raced out to the airport got on the airplane

688
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Because when they

689
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
But they found his if you had the surgery do it spread the cancer through your body

690
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
And they needed to

691
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Tezapp

692
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
And get rid of

693
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
The first cell

694
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,928
She got on the plane and he convinced her to go into the treatment and they just took her almost

695
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
You know Ted to dad let me borrow marrow transplant everything

696
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
And she lived

697
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
And she still like today and wow

698
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
She and I have a very special relationship

699
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
From this day

700
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Because of that

701
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
That is it was a it was a miracle

702
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
And so

703
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,872
She was going through this treatment and Herb's there and so I'm sad

704
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
Simjang you want to sell this company she said yes I do

705
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,272
So you're like in early 30s

706
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Do you believe God

707
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
December cash like

708
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
At least 20 million bucks and

709
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
All of a sudden you become a

710
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
4 year Southwest Airlines

711
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
Herb

712
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
Yeah he he always tells a story that I had my

713
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
My Book of Mormon

714
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
My Bible and my Southwest Airlines annual report

715
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
In my car no that was my scriptures

716
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,104
Not too far from the truth

717
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
So we were

718
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Yo clothes and and he said look I want to put you on the executive planning committee

719
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
Which is our top

720
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
A steering committee

721
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
And I was just

722
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Setting this meeting

723
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
And I would just

724
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Watch these guys

725
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
And it would just go on and on and

726
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
Every time I would say something that look at me like

727
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
What's the weather right now

728
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
Lesion pancreas know anything he's ever been hearing

729
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
So I used to just

730
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
I see this right

731
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:37,312
Don't say a word don't say a word to keep that writing and I just blurt out something else

732
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,896
They asked me to take two years to integrate Maurice into Southwest

733
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,224
And within six months I had it all done

734
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
I basically

735
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
Joint fuel purchase joint ground handling

736
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
Yashow everything was all done and

737
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,744
Chapas had this had the steel where they were charging off-peak fares

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
On Saturdays and Sundays

739
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
And after like 8 p.m. at night

740
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
I went to message guys

741
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
My atmospheres are on Sunday and you just

742
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Switch them all.

743
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,824
Pete I'm losing like millions of dollars every month because

744
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
You're charging off peak

745
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
Let me charge Peak on this flight

746
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,064
And so I sat down with keoki Taylor the time he was he head of Revenue management I showed him all the numbers and

747
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,416
And it was during that time they switch to know when starting charging Peak for Sundays and they

748
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Your Southwest

749
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Has made profit

750
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
43 years in a row or whatever

751
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
And

752
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,680
They were so successful you know they didn't really need to find and I was

753
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,520
Just absolutely paranoid all the time and I had to keep tweaking everything

754
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Thing all the time

755
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,384
And so I was pressing all that stuff at them and finally

756
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Herb invited me to Ruth's Chris

757
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
Steakhouse in Dallas and said

758
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
Get out here driving everybody insane in this company

759
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
I said well

760
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,440
You're paying more for long distance per minute than we are I'm just try to get him to

761
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,744
Take our contract instead of your Contracting

762
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Herb I got that the peak fares that I got that thing integrated I got this

763
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
He said I know David but that

764
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
That's 5 mods

765
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
You should have taken you longer to do stuff and I said alright I was in tears it all but you were supposed

766
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Stu

767
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
Stay in Southwest for at least 2 years

768
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,736
And we love our way he kind of led me to believe that if I just

769
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Minding my p's and q's that I would be a success or what

770
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
You know that I care

771
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
You know I'm following his footsteps in

772
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
You know obviously there are other people that wanted that job and I was young and completely didn't fit into the

773
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
My ADD was just

774
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Raging

775
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,704
So you were supposed to I mean this is going to be your employer and maybe you would have

776
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Succeeded herb Kelleher is it

777
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
Harris Southwest and you were

778
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
We were fired up

779
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Like 5 or 6 months

780
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Yeah in May

781
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,760
So I started in December and they fired me in May

782
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,064
I can't imagine him like yelling at you and say

783
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Get out of my office

784
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
Delete let you down gently

785
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,232
Oh yeah he wish across the table and held my hands and I was crying and

786
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
He just said you know it's just

787
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Not going to work

788
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
I said everybody

789
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,704
Even your even the people that your biggest supporters say that you had to go

790
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,544

People often think annuities are too conservative

817

Too complex

Or only for retirees

819
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
But annuities

820
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
This can be a smart way to hedge Market

834
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

835
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
95

836
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,144
And the old man was just fired from Southwest Airlines

837
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Southwest

838
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Company

839
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
Idolized

840
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,520
Not work for

841
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Airlines for

842
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,360
5 years because of Southwest non-compete clause

843
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
So David

844
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
He went home

845
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,528
I went home and I spent a couple days at home and

846
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
I feel like I can't do this

847
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm not going to I'm not going to retire

848
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
Until I went down tonight

849
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
I rental office instead of going to work everyday in Salt Lake and by this time Dave Evans who was my partner had been

850
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Going back and forth

851
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Dave Evans I'm guessing

852
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
You guys were together

853
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Yeah and he came to me said look

854
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Ticketmasters the future

855
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,104
Why don't we build a system in and sell it to all the airlines

856
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
So I said how much money he will take and he said

857
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
A million dollars so I said okay let's

858
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Let's do it

859
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,088
Guinness hard remember but like even in the mid-90s when you're running the company

860
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,184
Like an airline ticket was a was like up a booklet with carbon copy

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Pages

862
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
Like you would die

863
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Bring this physical

864
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Booklet

865
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
To get onto a plane

866
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
And Heaven help you if you lost

867
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,448
I know you were here in trouble if you lost the 85 big forms

868
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,056
Lost ticket forms and then they had these big auditing departments would look for him and

869
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
You. Keep coming back every 3 months

870
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
See if there

871
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,968
Did anyone ever claim your ticket and if not then you have maybe they would give you a refund at the end of

872
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
I'm so

873
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
It was a it was a real pain

874
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
What's the Circle K

875
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,112
You guys I guess you guys wanted to build

876
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,952
The reservation system that you could essentially then sell to the airlines

877
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Why wouldn't

878
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Xiamen airlines

879
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
To do it themselves

880
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Well they didn't

881
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:24,192
Airlines had these big Mainframe computer systems they were using the time and everything was done are flat

882
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
So there was no relational databases

883
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
The actual the database was actually

884
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
So if you lost your ticket

885
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,224
And so it became a negotiable document

886
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
And they didn't have any other way of tracking

887
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
And then they would look at things

888
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
In the rearview mirror that happened 3 or 4 months ago

889
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Dad no forward-looking ability

890
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
At the time

891
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,608
And so by us building the system we allowed people have real-time information all the reservations that were coming in

892
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
Yeah we can tell them

893
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
You know what the average fare was with the

894
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
But the love doctor wasn't he's fly all the

895
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Stop that they never have before

896
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,384
It's always a huge it was a revolutionary change for the airline business

897
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Set the time

898
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,504
And so did that during this period of the non-compete and

899
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
About halfway through the non-compete I called

900
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
A cup of coffee I made a year-and-a-half into it I called her man

901
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
I said hey herb

902
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
You know I've consulted

903
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Aldea counseling

904
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Kissing is not really

905
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
I mean I didn't get it consideration

906
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
He said David you're the last person I want to see the airline busy

907
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,496
I will fight you tooth and nail I do not want to see you in the airline biz

908
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,824
Alright fair enough and I signed it that's

909
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
I live by my word

910
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
You end up selling

911
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
Honest Company 2

912
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
New HP Hewlett-Packard

913
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
In 1998

914
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
And that's when you

915
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
Cat gets put your head down

916
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Unless

917
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
The JetBlue idea but even before then

918
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Understanding is that you actually started to

919
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Think of

920
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
The JetBlue idea

921
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
Within a year after leaving

922
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Southwest is that right

923
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Yeah

924
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
I'm a new I had for years and I had the reservation system so I knew exactly what the reservation system would be

925
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,872
You know I just I just kind of biting my time

926
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
Understand this

927
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Why

928
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,272
Did the graveyard of Airline like a failed Airlines is

929
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Cute right like

930
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
Trump and liquor and

931
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
People movers what is called tw8ns

932
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
People Express

933
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Like

934
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,072
What did you think the world needed like there were a bunch of Airlines

935
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Southwest was

936
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Thriving like

937
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
What was it that you

938
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Thought

939
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
You could contribute to that

940
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
To that industry

941
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Well I thought that

942
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,616
A couple things Southwest had a real book

943
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
That they didn't really violated the time

944
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,224
One of them did they never flew into

945
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Kind of congested Airport

946
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
They didn't

947
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
Want because on-time percentage in

948
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,672
We are turning our plans in 10 minutes was just so important to them

949
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
That they didn't want

950
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
To go to near

951
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,608
Boston they weren't in Boston they want they were in Providence

952
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
The end

953
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,216
So they they they kind of skirted around airports they

954
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Never went into SFO there were no clue

955
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
And so

956
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
They didn't really

957
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,640
Now go into these these East Coast

958
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Congested airports in

959
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,248
You're Dumber who is the founder of people Express

960
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,368
Came to see me one time and I remember he was looking at starting an airline and you wanted to do in JFK

961
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
And he was saying

962
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,000
During the middle of the day you could run a bowling ball down the middle of

963
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,632
Of the runways at JFK throw me at night there's nothing in the day and there's a lot of people there

964
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,448
Search kind of file that away and and you know his

965
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
His airline didn't materialize

966
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
I so when it came time for me to

967
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Profound

968
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
Your JetBlue I want it

969
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
To find a place that I could

970
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
Who starred in the NFL in the area where I knew there was a lot of people I studied

971
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
The New York travel Market

972
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,088
And so I thought well this the perfect place to put an airline

973
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
You thought you could do a discount Airline

974
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Fly to places

975
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
The discount Airlines were not

976
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Flying to

977
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,328
Yeah we're Southwest Airlines wasn't you remember that

978
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
The time to

979
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,728
Doll the carriers the Legacy carriers had accumulated so much

980
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
Stuff and pension programs in

981
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,896
Yeah that the customer service that time wasn't very good and yeah

982
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,944
We want to bring Humanity back to Eritrea

983
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
At yuan this is something that

984
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
I've kind of learned over the years

985
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,392
Number one is you don't just go star near line for the Sega starting you have to have

986
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
A reason for being but also

987
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
Just because

988
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
You're in a place where no one else

989
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Flies or can fly

990
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Doesn't mean

991
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
That

992
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
You know you can treat people poorly

993
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
So let's treat people awesome

994
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
Let's find a place that nobody else flies but fly fishing rods inside layering all this site say I was saying my team guys

995
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
Too much Overkill is Never Enough let's just keep lowering it on

996
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Make it better and better and better

997
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
What did you want

998
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
Did you have a vision of what you wanted JetBlue to be

999
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
I mean

1000
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,720
1990s

1001
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
What that was rev I remember

1002
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
Virgin Airlines

1003
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
Flight in the 90s yellow TVs

1004
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Great food and it was just

1005
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
It was very different

1006
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
Felt completely different from any other Airline

1007
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Yeah and I know I was talking to earlier

1008
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Richard Branson early on

1009
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
JetBlue was going to be called Virgin America

1010
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
You're kind of funny story

1011
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah I'm still

1012
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,064
A little bit off the turnip truck coming from Utah you know

1013
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
Richard invites me to fly over tonight

1014
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
And I go to his house

1015
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
And

1016
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
Course he's there with his wife and speaking in the

1017
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Suave British accent

1018
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Completely enamored and then he

1019
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
She looks go eat Indian food and I'd never eat Indian food buffet

1020
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
For if you can believe that I love Indian food

1021
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,312
It is a bus go watch a movie and he took me to his virgin theater in

1022
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
And that

1023
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
Please wife and I and we saw the full monty

1024
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,759
Which was from Mormon guy was completely it a little off colour for me but

1025
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
I came home got a chuckle about that move you better

1026
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,439
Loving chicken curry which I had that night which I haven't been able to stop eating ever since so

1027
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
But but Richard

1028
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,303
At the time that he wanted a franchise fee and he wanted

1029
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,143
To maybe change go to head gone to Washington and it convinced him that

1030
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,983
Maybe he could change the laws on foreign ownership so he could control it

1031
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,615
Where you may have answered launching JetBlue would have launched

1032
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Virgins us

1033
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Domestic Airline

1034
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,527
Yeah I mean I thought that having a brand was important I flew on Virgin night

1035
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
China's old TVs

1036
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,695
Yeah I saw that whole service and I thought wow you know if I could create this this would be amazing

1037
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Soaps

1038
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
5 year

1039
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
Like. Of that like

1040
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
Non-compete what ended I guess around 98

1041
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
At that point like

1042
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,007
Right when it ended is that when you announced that you were founding JetBlue did you

1043
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
The units at Publix

1044
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Yeah I mean

1045
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
I couldn't sell a ticket but I can do everything but

1046
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
That's so

1047
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
You know I had the reservation

1048
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
System ready to go I had to

1049
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,551
Could start working on it even before this night

1050
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Send it

1051
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,927
Yammy we started flying in February of the year 2000 so

1052
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,279
We were working hot and heavy we moved I moved the family to Connecticut

1053
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,071
In July of 99

1054
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
And we were funeral full Boar Head raised

1055
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
135 million dollars

1056
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
It's how we were all ready to go

1057
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
Southwest

1058
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Revolutionize was they just peanut they never served

1059
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
Food Rite Aid they was peanuts

Are pretzels and free drinks

1061
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Stand up

1062
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Very friendly service

1063
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
And

1064
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
And they also

1065
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,855
Only flu and still do only flies

1066
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
White 737 Boeing 7

1067
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
37

1068
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,023
So did you kind of look at that and say yep that's our best the model that we should go for Wii

1069
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,095
You should get the same exact plan cuz I don't like to maintain one cup

1070
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
Plain and not

1071
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Worried about food and all that

1072
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
Yeah that was

1073
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,799
I hired to be my CFO at JetBlue

1074
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,639
Remember the name of John Owen and he was the treasurer at Southwest

1075
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
And so he knew all the financial

1076
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
About

1077
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
Southwest know what they were buying airplanes from Boeing from and there by 7:30

1078
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Chris Evans

1079
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,671
And we tried to go to Boeing we wanted the 737 we really wanted it

1080
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,767
And we just said look how about giving us this price and they said

1081
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071

Get ready to go see her bus and they said well go ahead so

1083
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Flew back to Washington DC weather North American officers were for air bison Armory coupon

1084
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,151
Biking is a friend of mine today and he said

00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Kefir are basset

1087
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
The time he walks in and he says

1088
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Are you just here using us

1089
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855

00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,279

Kind of The Wider cabin the fly-by-wire

1096
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
All the stuff the more seats

1097
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,031
It's because we could we could go 262 seats on an airplane

1098
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
And so I completely got

1099
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
Convert it and bring it up

1100
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,455
Upcoming below that number which I would have shaken with them on the first day

1101
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,831
But we were willing with Airbus and we got to get the relationship

1102
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Airbus a320

1103
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,159
Yeah so then that's their version

1104
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183

00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
A320 is there there they competing

1106
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535

1107
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
320s and

1108
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Put TVs in the back and

1109
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Free TV and

1110
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Nicesense

1111
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,263
Fact I remember I've read I read somewhere

1112
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Quote of yours

1113
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
You said

1114
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
JetBlue is a customer service company

1115
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
Describe it as a customer service company

1116
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,967
It happens to fly airplanes

1117
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Which reminded me a lot of

1118
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
Of Tony hsieh Zappos

1119
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Is he described

1120
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,135
We were customer service company that happens

1121
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Esl shoes

1122
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Yeah

1123
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,815
Is that is that how you thought I just

1124
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
I just want to do everything and maybe it was because

1125
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
I came up this whole notion of servant servant leadership

1126
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,751
United maybe I learned that on my mission

1127
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Have serving others and

1128
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,103
Firehouse Southwest that build their culture and

1129
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
Yeah just about this thing at

1130
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Yeah we're going to go out

1131
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
And we're going to take care of our people

1132
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
And the people going to take care of our customers

1133
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,343
It was funny cuz when I was talking to investors in New York they said

1134
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,927
Hey dude your New York you're not going to find friendly people in New York

1135
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
I said well I got a lot of life

1136
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Choose from so there's

1137
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,327
Is 59 people after I'll find some nice people

1138
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
And we sure did

1139
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
You guys are

1140
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Profitable

1141
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Pretty quickly

1142
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,519
And it is a difficult time after 9/11

1143
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,359
One of the things that you did a lot

1144
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
Do you fly the planes all the time YouTube making announcements

1145
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
That you are the

1146
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,063
The hair company and then you would sit on the planes and serve snacks and

1147
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
How clean the planes

1148
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,695
Without a sticker was a tree limb and what was that about

1149
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,255
I just really want to stay in touch with her cousin

1150
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
I really want to hear from them

1151
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
You know not only what I get up and introduce myself but I would also

1152
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Jose Jimenez

1153
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
Come by it's our snacks

1154
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
But I also want to hear from your experience without company I want to know

1155
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
What we did good what we did bad

1156
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
You know what we can improve on

1157
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Any ideas you have for us

1158
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
And then I had

1159
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
Your other people in our company doing the same I just think

1160
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
It's just incredible to stay in touch

1161
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
With your

1162
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
With your people and then

1163
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
Yeah those working the flight

1164
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
See that you care

1165
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Southwest

1166
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
Their staff is unionized

1167
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
And you did not have a union staff

1168
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,215
Why did you feel like I don't want to deal with unions either that's going to

1169
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,495
I just drag us down

1170
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
What was her reason

1171
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,871
You know I always thought if our people needs

1172
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
Someone else

1173
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
Become callous how to

1174
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Treat them

1175
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Then that would be

1176
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
Pretty tragic

1177
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,831
If I thought I didn't treat our people well enough

1178
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
Did they needed somebody else

1179
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Then you know

1180
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
That's how I can be I wanted to run

1181
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
So

1182
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
If I not being unionized and I could chip in and

1183
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,583
Yeah pick up trash on the airplane and there wouldn't be a grievance file

1184
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
Example her

1185
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,191
And what one of the questions we ask in the interview process is

1186
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Now in your

1187
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Courier

1188
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,895
Life can you give us some examples of where you left your area of responsibility and help somebody else out in another area

1189
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,967
Because that was really something that we thought Avenue

1190
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
It's amazing how many people couldn't come up with one single example

1191
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
Have of how they could chip in and help out

1192
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Yeah we didn't hire a pilot that had

1193
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:34,047
15000 hours and he was called me up screaming and I can't believe you would hire me I'm an experienced pilot

1194
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,703
I went to the interviewers and they said well he couldn't come up with one single excuse if anything's ever done to help anyone other than himself

1195
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
So

1196
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Yeah it was

1197
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,335
It was a cultural thing in building the culture was important

1198
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
David

1199
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
One of the things about

1200
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Beerland

1201
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,735
History is that it's a volatile right like

1202
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
The price of oil is is huge Factor

1203
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Niigata recessions

1204
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
Security scares 911

1205
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Traveled a lot less

1206
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,511
-10 is it in general the margin

1207
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
You know

1208
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,119
Reliance is hugely profitable there generally

1209
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
That the Martian

1210
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Fan right

1211
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Happy Camp

1212
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,567
I mean it's a it's a business so you can make a lot of money and you can lose a lot of money

1213
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Yes it what is it that you guys

1214
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,663
And how are you able to be profitable

1215
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
So fast

1216
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
For so long

1217
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Compared to

1218
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
TIGER Airline

1219
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,879
Well I think it was just a weird differentiator I mean people sauce and

1220
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
Yeah we had to word-of-mouth and people love flying us but it's just

1221
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
Building a better master

1222
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,047
Trap and building a better company and and

1223
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
Night I became enamored

1224
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
At with this whole thing when I was running company

1225
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
I read

1226
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
This article call the constant customer

1227
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,287
Some companies just grow quicker

1228
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
The more successful

1229
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
You know and they did a lot of research into what

1230
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,223
What what it was about these companies that differentiated him from

1231
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
From other companies

1232
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,879
And there's actually United Airlines and Southwest in the article and it talked about the differences

1233
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Between the two and how they ran their business

1234
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,999
And the three things they named was

1235
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,607
You know number one is having people who work for you that are ambassadors for your brand

1236
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
Adore your company

1237
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
That feel valued in

1238
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
And feel loved in a comfy

1239
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
Number one number two was

1240
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Flawless X

1241
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,639
Vacation on every single level you need to be completely flawless

1242
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
And so

1243
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,759
I web dashboards everyday what I can tell you everything's going on

1244
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
At my company's Ein

1245
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:35,135
On-time percentage when the last bag made it to the carousel on the most delayed flight

1246
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Everything about

1247
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
That experience

1248
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
She need to be Flawless and then

1249
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
The third thing is you need to make it right with

1250
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
The customer review

1251
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
Make a mistake or you

1252
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
Treat them imported whatever

1253
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:50,495
You need to make them more loyal having had an issue with your company than if they had not had an issue in the

1254
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
So JetBlue is like

1255
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
Riding High

1256
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,431
Profitable to Darling upholstery customers loved it

1257
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
Then comes

1258
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
Valentine's Day

1259
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
2007

1260
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,623
The biggest ice storm in the Northeast in Lake decade

1261
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
What happened

1262
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
Well it wasn't just an ice storm it was

1263
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,839
BFA had come out with this regulation

1264
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
That it was only that year

1265
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
Yeah it was only in 2007 where

1266
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,031
They said if there is what they called ice pallets in the air

1267
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
When you can't

1268
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,223
That they reverse the next year they didn't have it anytime before that never had his head so is his what he's convergence of a

1269
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Where

1270
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Are planes

1271
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,647
Got out to the runway to take off they called ice pellets

1272
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,951
Planes worst planes are landing

1273
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
I'ma Mendes

1274
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:50,399
Storm moved and we had people stranded airplanes we couldn't get him back to the gate because

1275
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
People say I

1276
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,239
Actually Moore equine xi an hours

1277
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
And so

1278
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,335
It was a disaster and it was something that

1279
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
And then you don't have to Dumpty was all over the place and it took us a long time to recover what happened what operation

1280
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
National team failed Airline you know

1281
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,831
It was just simply that simple I mean it was

1282
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,207
You know they just didn't do a good job of handling the situation and

1283
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Your ass as I was

1284
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
I was in the command center for

1285
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
4 straight days

1286
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,399
After you obviously got people off the airplane in

1287
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
The octave

1288
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
The first day but we had the whole

1289
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,823
Play Swiss scramble then there was all kinds of bad publicity you know to the airline which is

1290
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,103
You devastate for me

1291
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,919
Person cuz we pride ourselves in running such great Airline

1292
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
I think I set a record on that day

1293
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:42,111
Where I started on the Today Show and I ended up on the Letterman show images of the you apologizing

1294
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,439
Apologies explaining what happened

1295
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
27 live interviews

1296
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
All kinds of TV

1297
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
But I came up with this

1298
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,935
List of things that you know where we're going to do and then a Bill of Rights saying

1299
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
This ever happens again this is how you become

1300
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
But how did it

1301
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
I mean how did it happen

1302
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
I think

1303
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
Their 1200 flights that were canceled

1304
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
Over the next couple days ago

1305
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,015
Why did it did this winter storm hit JetBlue harder than other airlines

1306
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
Was it just a

1307
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
A failure of management

1308
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:17,695
What will ironically I think the others may have recovered better but Delta had planes out there

1309
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
You know it's about the same amount of time if everybody was effect

1310
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
It wasn't just us

1311
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
Take us longer to recover

1312
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,191
But also people expected more

1313
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
I mean I think

1314
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,055
Sometimes the media likes to build you up and then they like to

1315
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
To tear you down

1316
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
If you're flying too high

1317
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,247
You know we're going to come after you if you if you're riding story we're going to tell about you but

1318
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
You mess up even just this much

1319
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
And then I was in a well on the way to fish

1320
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,183
And making sure that it would never happen again when

1321
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
And

1322
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Couple months

1323
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Later the board asked me if I would do

1324
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,071
Just step up to be chairman In-N-Out

1325
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Kind of lettuce

1326
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399
Cielo at the time be the CEO

1327
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,543
Here we go again and I wouldn't I was Herman this and but

1328
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:09,407
It was different with this time obviously this was my baby I mean

1329
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
I know it was I kill myself

1330
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
His company

1331
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
End

1332
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
The Borg

1333
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,575
Cuz you didn't it was a public company and now you work for the

1334
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Shareholders

1335
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
They said

1336
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
We don't want you to run it anyway

1337
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
More

1338
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
I can't imagine that wouldn't be deficit

1339
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Yeah it was it was

1340
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,143
It was not steady but it was it was just absolutely the wrong decision

1341
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
That was the worst

1342
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
I mean if I

1343
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,519
Maybe I was

1344
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:41,919
My perception is better than what I actually my Persona is taking on a much bigger role.

1345
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
We had a couple of

1346
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
No guys on the board that were

1347
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,367
Had developed this thing about founder syndrome and thought hey maybe it's better to turn over to someone

1348
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
Take the kid I can run the company without the the passion and and just you know it's kind of like a regular

1349
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
Business

1350
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,119
They felt it that you had to be held accountable

1351
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Will Ferrell

1352
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
For the

1353
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
The blizzard

1354
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,007
Absolutely I mean I had to be held accountable

1355
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
And

1356
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,079
Yeah and I was taking responsibility

1357
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
I mean one of the board members kept saying to be quite apologize

1358
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,479
Yeah we don't like you to apologize and said because

1359
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,271
You're not you shows inside a week

1360
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,087
Or whatever so we can blindsided by it

1361
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,231
It's completely I mean it was a shocking thing that I couldn't believe it I mean

1362
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:32,863
That was my office was just off the boardroom in the nr22 of the board members

1363
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
MK management

1364
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
Said you know this what we're going to do

1365
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,471
And then they all got up and left

1366
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,775
Got an airplane and flew away

1367
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Were you personally hurt

1368
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
Oh yeah totally

1369
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:51,551
Four years as I would land in JFK I would be hard even look over you know it JetBlue. Cuz it was hard to even see

1370
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
CMI Airlines

1371
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,903
I wrote a letter to

1372
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,695
The crew members when I left

1373
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,279
And I still had access to equity now so I set it out and I just said

1374
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,631
Yeah I've always taught you that it's not really what happens to you is

1375
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
It's how you do it

1376
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,031
And so you know I've always had this lifetime dream to return to Brazil

1377
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,335
And make a difference in the country of my birth

1378
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
And

1379
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
I'm going to do it

1380
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:23,295
So I'm going to leave the board and you know I just want you to remember all those values and treat each other well

1381
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
And I miss you

1382
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
Terribly

1383
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,183
Ain't nothing I'd like more to be back as your CEO but

1384
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,791
You know that's not the way life is sometimes you don't get to make all the decisions and

1385
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Worst ever win the Bastion and I was gone

1386
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
We can stop this park

1387
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Cast now and then

1388
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,239
End of story you start another airline

1389
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
You start a brand

1390
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
New Airline

1391
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
In 2008

1392
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,127
Health Azul in Brazil by the way

1393
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Which one is blue

1394
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Was that

1395
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,735
Will it delivered did you call Azul

1396
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
Deliberately

1397
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Yeah

1398
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
It was

1399
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
I think it's obviously was have great affection for JetBlue and is always the closest thing in his old spino blue

1400
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,303
Portuguese in Spanish so

1401
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:11,935
I had made some trips down there in and you know it had this thing tucked away in the back of my head about

1402
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,495
Going back to Brazil and making a difference

1403
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
And

1404
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
Did I had when I was a 19 year old boy

1405
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,663
And one of the things that was amazing to me is how few people were traveling

1406
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
I am Brazil

1407
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,551
And I determined that there were two major reasons number one

1408
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
The service just wasn't good

1409
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
As far as Non-Stop

1410
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Twin Cities

1411
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,999
25 largest cities in Brazil only had nonstops about

1412
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:42,655
20% of the time but then they were like 50 cities that have no service that needed service that no one flew to these cities

1413
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:48,031
And they're making people drive for hours makes airplanes the major aircraft manufacturer

1414
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:54,431
Yeah they had they had during the military rule the military had done in tight traffic building Airport

1415
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
But nobody flute to him

1416
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,807
And then fairs were really high they were by double where they were the United States

1417
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
So I thought

1418
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,903
Well I'll go to Brazil I'll buy Brazilian made airplanes

1419
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,463
What's your lowest smaller have a lower trip cost

1420
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,815
And then I'll start flight all these cities that nobody flies to and it will be a bit

1421
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,143
And it happened third largest

1422
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
Airline in Brazil today

1423
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,519
It's the number one airline in terms of daily departures

1424
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
Number one Airline

1425
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
And numbers of City surgery serve over a hundred cities

1426
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
In Brazil

1427
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:30,271
We have 800 flights a day we fly about 80000 people every single day wow

1428
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
It's 10 years

1429
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
Did you mean

1430
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,231
You must have learned so many lessons along the way right at Southwest you are

1431
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,327
Yeah they fired you for 5 months and you can do any better than and then you know

1432
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
JetBlue office

1433
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Did the Borg

1434
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:50,751
Decided they wanted somebody do there when you structured as well did you make sure

1435
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
But that could not

1436
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Happened to you

1437
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,823

But I have a voting control

1441
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:07,647
Sensation picture that could not happen again fair enough

1442
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Absol

1443
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023

Could a board meetings and run these companies and also

1451
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Raz-Kids

00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
How are you able to make

1453
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,359
Time for the more you did did you

1454
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Fidget mix

1455
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:33,503
Well I had a couple rules and number one is I always was home on weekend

1456
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
I never

1457
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
Since I don't golf

1458
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
And I hate people who golf now

1459
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Have a joke I have but

1460
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,207
No matter what was in the world I would make sure I was home

1461
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,023
Yeah either Friday morning

1462
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,095
Our Saturday morning and stay till either Sunday night or Monday night

1463
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
So

1464
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
That was

1465
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
Really important to me I

1466
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
Needed to be home I need to be recharged

1467
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,543
Do with my kids and I need to be with them and you know

1468
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
NFL

1469
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,919
My daughters were dancing my sons were playing football or lacrosse I always tried to

1470
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,271
Make sure I work my schedule around it so I would always be there for him if they need me and

1471
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,623
And I tried to be the best father I could and we obviously

1472
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,439
I wasn't there at 5 every night

1473
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
To have dinner with them

1474
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
But you know I had a lot of support from

1475
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,119
You know my wife and and the kids

1476
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
You know really

1477
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
Helped each other I mean my

1478
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
Oldest daughter was

1479
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,823
Amazing and then the second daughter and then that their daughter and then

1480
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,639
Finally got a signed number for until they helped

1481
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,247
With each other and they and they chipped in and then when the first one got the driver's license they were

1482
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,575
You helping all the kids around hit their lessons and so

1483
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
It was really a family f

1484
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
It's a great family and I know you didn't mention that I have

1485
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,255
18 grandkids and three on the way

1486
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
What is your sort of like dining

1487
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,863
Principal as

1488
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
A leader like now that you

1489
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
Made mistakes and you

1490
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:00,543
You know driven people crazy and kind of had time to reflect on

1491
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,615
Kind of person you are you are what are you

1492
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,687
What do you Aspire like how do you aspire to leave

1493
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,991
What do you want people to say about you and I

1494
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
Oh yeah David

1495
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
He is

1496
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
He made my life better

1497
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
You know I

1498
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
You know we have this

1499
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Thing at Isola where

1500
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,511
I tell everyone I want this to be the best job you've ever had

1501
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
I want you to look forward to come to work everyday until I walk around the company saying is this the best job you ever had is just the best job you had

1502
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
If not why not

1503
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,239
Cuz I think if you do that

1504
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Nephew matter

1505
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,055
If your company matter

1506
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
Then you're going to be more success

1507
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
Yeah if you were plexing face the Earth

1508
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Primary Care

1509
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,503
Yahoo wood-chopping memorial service

1510
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
How many lives have you touched

1511
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,903
Because I think the more people you touch in the more good that you do and then more people you serve

1512
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
And the more lives that you change

1513
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
The happy you are to

1514
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
So all the things all worked

1515
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,351
At 2223

1516
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Totally broke

1517
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
I give you life

1518
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Dixie's

1519
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
These Heights menu were broke

1520
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
And then

1521
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Back to work in your grandfather store

1522
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,591
And then all these amazing things happen

1523
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
To you and your life

1524
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
How much of that do you think

1525
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
Is because you were

1526
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,503
Really smart and hardworking and how much beef

1527
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Because of luck

1528
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
Why I think obviously you have

1529
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,623
Points of light

1530
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
But I think you make

1531
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Your own life

1532
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
Integrate

1533
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Add people

1534
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,815
And I I tell people this that have ADD

1535
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Embrace it

1536
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,167
It's you and it's who you are and take all the good for me

1537
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:36,799
Might form of a TD has it have an ability to just look at a situation

1538
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
That's very complex and simplify

1539
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
And say what you do it this way

1540
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
And

1541
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
It drives my teams crazy cuz they're like no it's not that simple I'm so yes it is just go do this this and this

1542
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
Json will have it solved

1543
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,671
And so you know sometimes it's not that simple but

1544
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,535
You know that's just who I am and that's how I'm wired I can look at a situation

1545
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,839
And you know I can I can see

1546
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Solutions

1547
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
And so

1548
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,471
I'm brother if it was in the airline business or any other business I think I would have

1549
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Probably had that

1550
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
Masculine

1551
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,079
But you know certainly the airline business has been

1552
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:16,735
My ticket to a lot of exciting times in my life and there's there's nothing like sitting in a cockpit landing and

1553
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
Airplane in the NFL

1554
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
4800 foot runway in Rio de Janeiro

1555
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,135
To give you a trail and knowing that that's

1556
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,439
You're planning your people and

1557
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231

1558
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255

It's still in the planning phase but the project has a name that

1566
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,855
Oh and you probably noticed how Southwest founder herb Kelleher played a huge role in David's life

1567
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,183
Poked her back she passed away soon after we recorded

1570
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,279

Smart Water

1588
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Pretty smart

1589
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1590
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,399
Alfred how you built that

1591
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
And today story starts

1592
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
In May of 2008

1593
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,287
18 in Queen Creek Arizona

1594
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,359
Lisa Dalton was dating a software engineer name

1595
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Ryan

1596
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
And Brian is

1597
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Is blind

1598
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,783
And one day Lisa was at his house looking through his Pantry in making a shopping

1599
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,367
He had 18 cans of refried beans and and didn't know it

1600
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,671
So Lisa decided to reorganize

1601
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,975
Also

1602
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:08,607
A big mistake Kitty is memorization based system to organize what he had in the pantry

1603
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
And

1604
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,727
My man handling the goods I had completely messed them up but

1605
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
Brian was

1606
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,519
Forgiving

1607
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,079
We said see it's okay you didn't know

1608
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,895
It wasn't okay

1609
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,687
Because Brian's personalized

1610
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,455
Pantry

1611
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
Something he relied on everyday

1612
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
Was God and now

1613
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,111
He had to reorganize and rememorize

1614
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
Lisa

1615
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
I felt awful

1616
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,023
I felt like melting into the floor but y'all thought there has to be a better system

1617
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Time for Brian

1618
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
He started

1619
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
She found a few salute

1620
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Oceans like pudding

1621
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Braylon

1622
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Index card

1623
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
And wrapping it around

1624
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
Can with a rubber band

1625
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,591
Wrong for a guy like Brian I just thought this is

1626
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,431
Not the level of household his stylish dude I wouldn't want him

1627
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,759
Have to do that ok something to know about Lisa

1628
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,087
She actually sells customized and commemorative bricks

1629
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Using stamps

1630
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,903
3D printer

1631
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
Figure out how to solve

1632
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:06,975
Problem like

1633
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Ryan Pantry she thought

1634
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
What about using my printer to make a reusable labels

1635
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
And so

1636
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
She did

1637
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
She came up with something that's

1638
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
I like those Livestrong wristband

1639
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
But with

1640
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,519
Rail on the outside

1641
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
Something you might

1642
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:26,175
Slip around the container it's a rigid plastic it has a little bit of giving it for you can just slide it on

1643
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,455
Anime Pop right off

1644
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
That Lisa had kept all of the sassy

1645
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,063
So when she gave Brian the label

1646
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:36,671
He kind of cracked up in his face changed and he's like that's weird but that's really cool

1647
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,999
And the next thing you said was hey you should really sell these

1648
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,583
Tulisa started working on more Braille labels for

1649
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
All sorts of

1650
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
Cans and jars

1651
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
And after a few months

1652
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Caterpillar

1653
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,543
Pipes and a convention hosted by the national Federation of the blind

1654
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
She didn't really have any

1655
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
Expectations

1656
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,383
Just wanted a little feedback

1657
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
But instead

1658
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
People kept

1659
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Coming to her booth

1660
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,295
And then they come back with friends

1661
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,575
And one woman

1662
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
Asked Lisa

1663
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,647
She would sell her a few of the Prototype

1664
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,695
She had packed her husband's lunch

1665
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
And grabbed the wrong container

1666
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
2Pac in my beer

1667
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,327
I mean I know

1668
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
How mortifying that isn't

1669
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,703
To know that you potentially made a job ending mistake

1670
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,239
Over something so simple

1671
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
It's got to be terrifying

1672
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,335
She said that she didn't pack his lunch anymore

1673
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
And that day

1674
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Talking to the people at the convention

1675
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
It was a revelation

1676
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,247
I got to the car that day and I totally cried

1677
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
It was

1678
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,391
Ridiculously moving the stories of how they've been trying to solve that problem

1679
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,951
And how they wish that this event come out

1680
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,767
20 years ago so Lisa went home and she

1681
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Build a website

1682
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
He went live in

1683
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,631
October of 2018 and now

1684
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
She sells her Braille labels for

1685
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
$2 each

1686
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
Chelsa salesman starter pack

1687
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
The name of the product

1688
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,383
Well he comes to my kind of Mantra she had four years ago while she was

1689
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,687
Recovering from a stroke she had when she was

1690
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
He's just 30

1691
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,271
There's a lot of things that I thought you know I can do that

1692
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,087
I can do that to Lisa Dalton calls her products

1693
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
Can do labels

1694
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
I just thought

1695
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,767
This would bring a lot of Independence to people who are also wanting to be able to do their own things I thought

1696
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
These are yes can do things

1697
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,863
And Lisa Belton

1698
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143

And doable

1700
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:29,567
