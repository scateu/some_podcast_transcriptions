Meet you there

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
Making spinach croissant

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
We buy the spinach Frozen we didn't have a way to to get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea with it

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Clothes dryers that will dissipate the water

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
It was a great idea until one day we flew the top off the the dryer in Nigeria ended up with

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,208
Spinergy nor 3000 square feet of the production space

41
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,608
From NPR how I built this

42
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

43
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
Stories behind the movement

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
How to build a successful bakery called Obama pants and then took a big bet

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
Build an even bigger restaurant chain

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Panera

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,912
Shake isn't a household name like say Howard Schultz

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,008
But you could argue that what Howard Schultz did for coffee

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Ron Shack Dead for

50
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
Cheddar broccoli soup or the asiago cheese bagel

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
Because like Howard Ron wasn't just focused on a product he was interested in creating

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
A space a place where people could hang out for a long time maybe even have a PTA meeting or social gather

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
Really linger over that

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Bagel or cup of soup this is the famous third-place concept that is Howard Schultz

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
Enron Shake wanted to tap into

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Panera became one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the world

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
Invested $7,000 in Panera stock in 1999 sitting on more than half

58
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Half a million dollars

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
I 2017

60
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
If you met Ron shakes a in high school this is not the path you have predicted

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
Ron wasn't even interested in business his

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
Passion with politics

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
His parents were raging liberals and Ron grew up going to rallies and volunteering on campaigns

64
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Oliver New Jersey

65
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Eventually went to Clark University

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,456
Where naturally he majored in politics he was quickly elected to Student Government

67
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
And that could have been Ron's life

68
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Except for one day

69
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
When something happened to Ron and a group of friends

70
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Small but something that when you look back on it

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,792
Probably changed his entire life

72
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,936
Yeah so we we were in a local convenience store called store 24 across the street from the main entrance to the

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
The Clark campus

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
And they accused of shoplifting and tossed us out

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,712
While we were shopping but if I came back to campus

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
And I was in my dorm room with a couple of friends I said

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
So why are we shopping there

78
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
I like to make sure he's like this where what supports that store

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
So what do we need for we can do we can do this ourselves

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
We can have our own convenience store

81
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
I said you know this isn't going to be that hard let's go do it

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
And we approached the university they weren't so keen on this

83
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
But

84
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
I move the question

85
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
The student body

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
The Boulder Dam

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Supportive it

88
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
And

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Lipase agreed to spend that summer between my sophomore

90
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
In junior year

91
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Opening this convenience store guy

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Wow so

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Would you guys sell

94
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
We sold it

95
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Everything from

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Drinks

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
2

98
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Munchies 2

99
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Cookies and candy in

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
You know

101
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
SAR System Manager

102
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Would come

103
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
To my apartment

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
5 in the morning

105
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
And we actually would go to the Steep discount

106
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Supermarket

107
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Bye

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
10 of 15

109
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Basket

110
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,663
It's full of merchandise that we stock the store with and we hire

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
20 30 different students to work there

112
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
I will

113
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Be very Frank and think it was more interested in that

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Store

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Then I was in

116
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
My own

117
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Academic life

118
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
And and your guy who's

119
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,327
Still focused on public policy and government but I guess this

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Was kind of cool you like

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
She kind of like doing business

122
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
You like running a business

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Yeah and any no I didn't see myself as that kind

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
And it took me

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
A while

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
To make sense

127
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
But it's so many ways

128
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Running a business

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
Is no different than a campaign

130
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Infected campaign

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
Is a business that that essentially has

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
One day in Wichita

133
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
A business is a campaign

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
It goes on and never ends

135
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
So at this point in his life Ron wasn't

136
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Quite sure what he wanted to do

137
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Business or politics

138
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,847
But people around him saw how much he loved running at convenience store and a lot of people said hey

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Why don't you get in the NBA

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,527
Sobrante enroll at Harvard Business School in 1976 and when he finished

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
I'm like a lot of his classmates who wanted to Banking and finance

142
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Brian decided

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Going to retail

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
And he took a job in the Midwest and a place called the original Cookie Company

145
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
20 stores in shopping malls we grew at about a hundred 25

146
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
I took the job as a third year of the NBA what I mean by that is

147
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
I took a job

148
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
As a district manager base Iran 10 or 15

149
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Of these cookie stories half the United States

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,759
And I spent my time running around the country

151
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
And I ended up opening

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Thousands of these

153
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Cookie stores around the country

154
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,255
So a certain point if you see your learning about the cookie business I guess and then we're at a certain point

155
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,863
You get this idea like hey wait I can do this myself I can have my own

156
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Cookie store

157
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,263
Yes and I can literally remember traveling across Indiana

158
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
On my way to Fort Wayne to open a new cookie store

159
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
And hit me

160
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
I said why are we opening this in a mall

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
There's a huge

162
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,295
Can you open these in an urban setting why don't we

163
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
And I remember going to my boss

164
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
I remember him taking me to meet

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
The CEO of the company I said

166
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
I want open Irving

167
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Cookie store

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
And it looks amazing

169
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
We don't do that here

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
We open wall base

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Retail unit

172
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
That's what you're not going to do it I'd like to go do it

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Why shouldn't we

174
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
And I'm the kind of guy

175
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
I say I'm going to do what I want to go do it

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
And it led me to actually

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Resigning my job

178
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Remove back to boss

179
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
And

180
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
I started looking

181
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
4

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Real estate

183
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
The reality was

184
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,719
Nobody would release me space for a couple of days

185
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Cookie store because they thought it wouldn't make enough money to pay the rent cuz I had no credibility

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
Real money

187
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
I had

188
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
So you don't know balance sheet to sign a lease

189
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
And so I went to my dad

190
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
And I said I want my inheritance

191
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
Whatever it's going to be I want the opportunity to use it

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
And I had about $25,000 my dad

193
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Essentially

194
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Let me gave me $75,000

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
And that hundred thousand dollars became

196
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
The grubstake the equity

197
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
That allowed us to build that

198
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
First one square foot cookie store

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Wow in downtown Boston

200
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Wouldn't you in the store

201
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
We needed the cookie jar

202
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,335
And I can remember we took the Toll House recipe right off the bat I bought a small mixer

203
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
And I would pass out cookies in front of the stores we were building it

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
And I start to adjust the recipe based on what I learned talking to customers and you were the baker you were making the

205
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Cookies yourself

206
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Yeah we opened there were three employees

207
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
I mean it was me

208
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
And two folks

209
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
I will never forget that day

210
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
It just seemed like people never stop walking

211
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Coming in

212
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
A person get 50,000 people day going by and I'll never forget it I got to the end of a day walking

213
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,383
Yeah but I got to the end of that that first afternoon we open to one guy

214
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,247
And by 6 we closed and my back was hurting my legs were hurting

215
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
And I counted the money I

216
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
We'd only brought in $400 and I mean

217
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
You forget when we talk about business what it is

218
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
The cell

219
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,583
400 batches of cookies in a buck each and the amount of energy and work that goes into it

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
That sounds

221
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Pretty good though music special

222
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
The first day

223
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Well I get no guy

224
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
The reality of the cookie business

225
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Pain in base of the any businesses

226
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
You got to pay the rent

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
The staff is essentially going to be there

228
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
So the question is

229
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
What's your volume

230
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
And

231
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
I was there maybe

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
Or five months in a we were surviving we're making a lot of money

233
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
A fun game

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
I wanted more what was your vision

235
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,559
For cookie jar did you imagine it being like that

236
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
Cookie Company work for in Ohio that it would be

237
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
A big chain

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
Cookie stores was that what you were thinking long-term

239
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
You know it's

240
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Funny I have never

241
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Started

242
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
With a

243
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Thai goal in mind

244
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
What I have always done

245
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
And to this day still do

246
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Seeing opportunity

247
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
I Wade out into the water

248
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
And I try to figure out where that opportunity is going to take me it's a little like bodysurfing when you go on vacation you go to the

249
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
The ocean

250
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Are you get out

251
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Far enough away from Shore

252
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
You start to watch the waves come in

253
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
And then you choose a wave

254
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
And you think that's going to be a powerful wave

255
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,311
And then you get on that wave and you see where it takes you and you start to the navigate

256
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
And negotiate your way to shore

257
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
Insult for me the cookie store was not an end

258
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
What it means to take me to the neck

259
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
I just love the process of figuring it out

260
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
I love the doing of the work

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
I was working a hundred hours a week

262
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
End end

263
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Never felt like work

264
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
It was Joy

265
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Oh that you

266
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,191
That it wasn't enough that you wanted more so what

267
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
What was your plan to

268
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Cookie jar

269
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Go to the next level

270
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Well it was really interesting I mean

271
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
I saw these 50000 people a day going by

272
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,247
But nobody bought cookies before 12 noon

273
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Myself wow what can we do with this

274
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
I thought

275
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
What do we put in

276
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
French bakery it's a sin to be

277
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Growing in

278
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Popularity

279
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
People are buying quests on

280
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
And the like

281
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
And I went to a local

282
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Company called hobo

283
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
The small just a local Boston chain

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
Like two or three location at that point they had three locations

285
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
And I became

286
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Their license AZ

287
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
For the one square block around my little cookie so in other words you sold what there

288
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Croissants

289
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
What I actually converted my store

290
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Two word have to logo

291
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Go sit had the old bumper

292
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Logo

293
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
And I have the cookie jar logo

294
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
And you could get

295
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
French bakeries that we baked

296
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
On premise or you could get

297
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
The cookies in the afternoon and the thing started doing very well

298
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
But

299
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Is an operator and I'm an opera

300
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
Rappers of these businesses

301
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
You know which of your vendors or any good

302
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
H art

303
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
And these folks

304
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Audubon pain

305
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
I was very clear to me they were out of

306
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
I love their product their product was great

307
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
What is a business

308
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
They were disorganized

309
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Sleep

310
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
Sometimes say delivered sometimes they didn't sometimes they billed me

311
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Sometimes

312
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
To this day I'm sure I still owe money they just

313
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Didn't have the basic processes

314
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Discipline

315
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
And that's typical in many small businesses

316
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
And

317
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
I saw a powerful opportunity

318
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
I put myself

319
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Wow

320
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
I really could straighten this business out I really could operate

321
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
So what ended up happening guy

322
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
I became

323
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Friends with

324
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
The

325
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Gentleman was running

326
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
The three of them pennsic I later became a

327
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Partner locator

328
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
And it was clear.

329
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
To him and to me

330
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
That Obama pain

331
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
Was not going to be able to continue growing

332
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Overstaying a business there and so

333
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
I came to them and said look at

334
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
I think I can

335
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Fix this

336
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
You give me 60% of the company

337
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
You and your investors

338
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Keep 40%

339
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
I'll put my cookie store which was making money

340
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
And with your 301 pants and will create a new

341
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
And it was in that process that we created what

342
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Peking

343
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
So once you did the deal with

344
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
What was Luann in open pan

345
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
What did you do like how did you even start

346
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
What I knew

347
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
I knew how to fix their business

348
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
I was committed to doing whatever it took to

349
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
To get this thing off the ground

350
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
So after we took over Obama

351
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
It was a mess

352
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
You know we didn't have a way we were making spinach quests on

353
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
We buy the spinach Frozen we didn't have a way to

354
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
To get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea with it

355
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
A dozen

356
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Dryers

357
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
Like hair dryers are no clothes dryers and well but put the spinach in the clothes dryer

358
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
And that will dissipate the water

359
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
From from

360
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Well that was a great idea

361
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
Frozen spinach into clothes dryers

362
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
Well we let it defrost first guy

363
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
But we put defrosted spinach in clothes dryers

364
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
I'm letting it run off the water

365
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
Was a great idea

366
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,943
Until one day we blew the top off the the dryer in

367
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Ended up with

368
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Spinach in

369
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,367
In all three thousand square feet of the production I used to love those spinach croissants at Oban pan

370
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
You do know how they were made did you

371
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
But I can literally remember guy

372
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
We didn't even have the ability to maintain our

373
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
And

374
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
I would use

375
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
My auto mechanic

376
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
2

377
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Outfits according to what else to call

378
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
And

379
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
We had a

380
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Dough divider

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
That

382
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
Was essentially being held together

383
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
Daily wire and paper clips made out of mechanic was trying to keep it going

384
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Elmer using

385
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Hanger

386
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
As the handle on this dough divider

387
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
I was in a

388
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Bakery at about

389
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
3 in the morning

390
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
And all of a sudden

391
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
UC

392
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Sparks come off this dough divider

393
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
And this guy

394
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
The individual who is working the dough divider

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Jumps

396
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Like a deer that have been shot

397
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Falls on the ground like a Raggedy Ann doll

398
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
Wow and I and everybody else

399
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
In the production era came running over to the sky

400
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Then I can just remember thinking to myself

401
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Please dear God let this guy

402
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343

406
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
The sex

407
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Vietnam

408
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583

Tattoos all over his body working the big

00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
He comes over and starts to do

411
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,007
Mouth to mouth resuscitation on impounding on his chest

412
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031

Panera Bread

456

And again and again

462
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Ron come to a point where he has to make a

463
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Big pivot

464
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Transformers business

465
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Annie 1985

466
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
3 years after

467

Ron

468
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Byers

469
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Small French bakery

470
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Boston

471
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
A business that's really struggling

472
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,351
He manages to turn things around with his partner lucane

473
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
But it's still a small business

474
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Vectron himself work

475
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
The sales counter during the day

476
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
But doing that

477
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
Actually helps him figure out almost by accident

478
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
In 1984-1985

479
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
I would be in a restaurant

480
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
And I have a customer walk up

481
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
Could I have that back at Rite Aid and they slice it

482
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
I hand them the loaf

483
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
And they pull out a bag from the local

484
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
Supermarket from local Stop & Shop

485
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
And they put roasted turkey and maybe

486
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Cheese on it

487
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
And you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA

488
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
This a

489
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Wow

490
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
The real thing here

491
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Is that the

492
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Again

493
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Is not the end

494
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
It's the platform to sell Sam

495
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
And in my whole view of business

496
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,159
If you really focus on listening you will see amazing things you'll learn amazing

497
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
And these customers in their behavior

498
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
We're showing us

499
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
The opportune

500
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
And so in 1985

501
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
We created

502
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
The first French Bakery Cafe

503
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
In the Copley Place Mall in Boston

504
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
See the side that you were going to make

505
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
This a new experience

506
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
It's a new experience for people could come and

507
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
Eat lunch and buy bread

508
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Yeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery

509
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
In almost instantly

510
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,719
Is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day

511
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
That we opened

512
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Copley Place

513
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,583
We had 50 people in line

514
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
Before we open the doors

515
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
And were you serving there

516
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
We were serving sandwiches

517
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
And some soups

518
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Meat on her bread and croissant

519
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,383
But they were differentiated

520
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Kinds of sandwiches

521
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
Is they were Roast Beef in and pours on

522
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
Real French baguette

523
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
It would be

524
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Roasted turkey

525
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
And Brie cheese

526
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
And I think what happened was providing

527
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
And I don't think we had language for it

528
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Back then

529
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
But what the bakery cafe was

530
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
Was an alternative

531
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Down and dirty fast food yeah

532
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
And fine dining

533
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
And for people who were working in White Collar jobs increasingly

534
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
In urban settings

535
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
This was the first

536
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
First example of what we later came to call

537
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Fast casual

538
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
This was an attempt to do something that was

539
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Better

540
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
But in a quick service mode

541
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Someone suits are still inside the area of

542
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
Printing cafes and bakeries

543
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
It was after the races you just a minute that point it was clear that

544
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
You were going to begin

545
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Pretty rapid expansion

546
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,448
Well can I tweet you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe

547
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
We saw

548
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
All kinds of

549
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
Interesting that we became hot

550
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
You know every major office building 1

551
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
And we found

552
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
We developed

553
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Big competitors

554
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Pepsi came after us

555
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
They decided this was going to be the third leg of Pepsi Food Service

556
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
And they'd created something

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Call La Petite

558
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Cheap lingerie

559
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
Sara Lee came after

560
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
They bought the

561
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Chain

562
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Call Michelle's back at they were going to open

563
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
100 store

564
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,680
There's a company in your part of the world down in DC called Vita France

565
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
And they were off and running

566
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
And we were

567
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Quite frankly the smallest of the

568
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,128
And the interesting part to me guys now

569
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
Is every one of these large competitors had people

570
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
With resumes Atwood run rings around Argyle

571
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,320
All of them had far more money in an ounce

572
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
They were going to open more store

573
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
But every one of them hit the wall

574
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
But they didn't have it

575
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Our people

576
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
For much more connected

577
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
Our guys weren't wearing about their next

578
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,888
Career move our guys were committed

579
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,216
In the Steep and profound way to making this concept work

580
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,800
So we ended up out operating all these larger companies

581
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
And by 1991

582
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
We were validated when we went public Morgan Stanley took his public

583
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
And we really had won the battle

584
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
To be the dominant bakery-cafe operator in the mirror

585
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
Alright so something something happens

586
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
Early in this period Shortly after you go public which is

587
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Olympian acquires this

588
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,400
Small chain of st. louis-based

589
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
Sandwich shops called the Saint Louis Bread Company

590
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
What what's the story there why did you buy this like

591
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,128
Small chain in St Louis was it that was the idea to to turn them into Au Bon Pain

592
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
No I you know I I talked

593
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
To everybody in our

594
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
There's nobody I don't learn from

595
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
And I was asked

596
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
Buying Investment Bank to me

597
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Several gentlemen

598
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
Who owned a company called st. Louis Bread Company

599
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
And it hit me

600
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Doing volume

601
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
Almost as much as we did with an Au Bon Pain

602
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
But doing so in Suburban St Louis

603
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
Struck me this was an opportunity

604
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
To acquire

605
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
St Louis Bread

606
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,176
And maybe we could build it into a 300 400 500 stores in the Suburban Market

607
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Follow ball pen wizard

608
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Urban Style

609
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
So in November of 1990

610
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
E3 we bought the Saint Louis Bread Company

611
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Those 19th stores

612
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
423 million dollars

613
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
You

614
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
Are looking at this thing just wait

615
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
We can use this as a way to get into the Suburban Market what was the St Louis Bread Company doing that was different

616
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Then why would it appeal to

617
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
2 Suburban consumers More Than a Woman

618
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Well it's interests

619
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,176
The Saint Louis Bread Company was in location sites

620
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
They were significantly larger

621
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
And that enabled it to have

622
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,832
Shall we say A Gathering Place or or

623
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Show Business

624
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
Saint Louis Bread Company

625
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
Was generating volumes nearly as high as Au Bon Pain

626
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:36,352
But doing so in real estate that cost half as much is he is the chill business like literally like

627
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Chill out

628
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Tell you mean when you say that

629
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah we called the Gathering Place or Childers ice cream place

630
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
But basically it's you know when you and you and you don't want to go back to the office

631
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
When you want to play

632
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
Stuff to read a magazine to do your bills

633
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Go on Wi-Fi where do you go

634
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
It's like the Starbucks this is a Starbucks

635
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Right

636
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,136
Yes tell the difference between us and Starbucks in Starbucks

637
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,976
They're tight spaces so you generally go in with your headphones on and try.

638
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Separate from everybody

639
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
Panera

640
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
Because we have the space

641
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
It's the kind of place you really do want to sit and do an interview

642
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
It's the kind of place that that

643
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,752
For a Bible study group or a

644
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
A team meeting

645
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
You can fit 6 8 10

646
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
Alright see you choir Saint Louis Bread Company

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
It's going to be sort of the Suburban

648
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
Alternative to i-mobile pan and you will not going to

649
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Give it the name of them had it was going to be

650
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
St.Louis

651
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Thread company or did you initially did you immediately realize you going to rename this

652
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Well we rename the

653
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Concept

654
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
Panera Bread in all markets other than St Louis

655
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
But we renamed it Panera Bread

656
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Cuz we went to Newmarket

657
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,032
People often thought St Louis was more associated with

658
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Knight's Tale horses

659
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
Pol

660
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Right and so

661
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
We wanted an empty vessel

662
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
Personality we could form

663
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
And

664
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Harborview

665
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Was we bought this

666
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Something good happen

667
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
Let's take a couple of years and studying

668
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
So what you do

669
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Soap

670
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
We went off

671
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
And I literally spent two years on the road

672
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
With yellow legal pad

673
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Talking to people

674
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,472
And it was very clear to me I'm always searching for what's the D for tractor

675
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
Post World War 2 fast food with special

676
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,640
You fast forward it 2 1990 with 60000 drive-thrus in America

677
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
Fast food had become

678
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
Self-service gasoline stations for the human body

679
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
And the reality of it was

680
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
Adore many consumers

681
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
They're holding their noses

682
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
21 in to feet

683
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
They wanted more than a lot of food cheap

684
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
It was very clear to us the same phenomena was happening and bread

685
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
You start to see the growth of specialty bread in

686
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
In the east coast in the West Coast

687
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
And we began to understand

688
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
If this phenomena

689
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
Offered a powerful opportunity somebody was going to dominate specialty food

690
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,456
And with the power of combining with a specialty bakery

691
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
We saw the potential to do it

692
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
So at a curiosity in that by 98

693
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
You're watching St Louis Bread Company a really start to

694
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Row

695
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Remember how many stores you had at that point

696
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
Whitney did you expand beyond the original 19

697
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,608
Yeah by 1998 we were awfully had a hundred fifty

698
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Tea stores

699
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
And I was having one of those moments that all

700
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
CEOs have

701
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Of self-reflection

702
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
I think that was kind of bummed

703
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
I was looking at

704
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Panera Bread

705
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
As one of four divisions in this

706
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Multi-divisional

707
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,064
Restaurant condo blancpain Teitelbaum Penn International

708
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,672
I have Panera in Audubon Penn manufacturing and I was with a friend

709
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
I said you know

710
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
For every hundred people

711
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
I talked about having a nationally dumb in a concept

712
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Whatever makes

713
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
To do so is so difficult but I said this one has that potential and my friend looked at me

714
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
What would you do

715
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
Panera on douban pan

716
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,152
Not open panels Panera

717
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,248
I said you know I take all the resources we had

718
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Put it against Panera becoming a nationally dominant

719
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,672
And I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen

720
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
You were proposing

721
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
To sell

722
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Au.bon pain

723
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
Antiques proposing to sell everything

724
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
Are all the human resource

725
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
And myself

726
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
And go down to make

727
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
So basically you're saying these

728
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Out of the four sub businesses

729
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
Let's get rid of these three take the cash and pour it into Panera cuz that

730
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,016
The place that's the thing that has the potential

731
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
Yes so you go to your bored and you say let's

732
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,928
Do this and your board is looking at you like you're nuts because they actually

733
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,744
Got into this business in because of a bundt pan

734
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,304
Literally that's what happened guy

735
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
It was a huge boardroom struggle

736
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Because I had two votes

737
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
Are Venture capitalists had three

738
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,264
And all of them invested in Au Bon Pain

739
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,056
Let's just say there were very heated to

740
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Discussions

741
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah and if I hadn't pulled this off

742
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
I probably wouldn't

743
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
App state is co

744
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,760
I mean you had a gas when you sold a lump and it was like

745
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Like 250 store something like that

746
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
50 * 2

747
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
And the Panera only at 180

748
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
You really were downsizing

749
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
But you thought we need to downsize in order to ethics

750
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
Blowed in growth

751
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
But I wasn't downsize

752
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
I was focusing

753
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
I could see the booty

754
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Angela Panera

755
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
In retrospect

756
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
It looks brilliant

757
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,056
Stock has been up a hundredfold since then

758
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
But going through it was horrible

759
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
Those businesses Au Bon Pain

760
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Was like my first child

761
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Yeah I birthday die

762
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Gruit

763
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
I lived it

764
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
I loved

765
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
But sometimes

766
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
You just have to March 4th

767
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
You have to know what matters in Panera's would matter

768
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
And you have to get it done

769
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
And so we live for the sale of all three other business

770
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
And

771
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
We change the name of the public company

772
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
From Au Bon Pain to Panera

773
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
And off we ran

774
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,592
And back then you could have bought our stock

775
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,712
For 3 and 1/2 $4 a share why didn't you tell me why didn't you call me then

776
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:18,112
You know God I was telling everybody nobody wanted to listen that 3 bucks a share

777
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
315

778
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
The truth is nothing to prove until it's done

779
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
So you

780
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
You are

781
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:32,448
Taking a big risk in 99 when you sell a bond by 2003

782
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
Panera Geneva

783
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Billion dollars

784
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,616
In sales are you doing a Victory lap are you like high-fiving

785
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
People in saying see I told you

786
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
Guy I never do a Victory lap

787
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
The reality is

788
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
The time to worry

789
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
About tomorrow is

790
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
My jobs

791
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Discover what's going to happen

792
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
I have what's called a retailers nightmare

793
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,608
Fear that that somehow someway nobody's going to show up tomorrow and then what

794
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,192
You know I get up on the stage right and I I speak in front of

795
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,568
5000 Penelope and I sit there and I think to myself as I'm speaking

796
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
I got these people are counting on us to make the right decision yeah

797
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,200
Their mortgage is their kids education

798
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,040
Their livelihoods their lives their careers are counting on us to make the

799
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
So I'm continually asking myself

800
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Where we going to be in 3 & 5 years

801
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,768
What do we need to do to get there how do we make sure we don't make a mistake

802
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
How do we care for this

803
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
How do we store it in the right way

804
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
What's interesting to me is that

805
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
This growth

806
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,704
Explosive in the early 2000s end

807
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,544
I guess by 2009 there was opening like a new store every

808
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
5 days

809
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
Basically every three days

810
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Ice insane

811
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Middle of the

812
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Worst financial crisis

813
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
How did that happen I mean

814
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
How did the financial crisis end

815
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,856
The classic Army not affect you guys

816
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Are whole View

817
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
Ways to make smart bets

818
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
And one of those smartbets

819
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Comes from a contrarian

820
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,144
Pre the recession pre the Great Recession

821
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
The whole world was

822
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
It was in a go-go kind of country

823
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
Everybody was Levering up their balance sheets

824
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Putting on Deck

825
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Borrowing money to buy backs

826
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Stock broker

827
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
At that time we held back

828
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Real estate cost for high

829
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
We didn't leverocks

830
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
When the recession hit

831
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Is Warren Buffett

832
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
To put it that's

833
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
The time you make a fortune

834
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
Our concept was still strong people are still visiting us we decided to invest our resources

835
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Growing even more quickly during the recession

836
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,216
Real estate cost for down 20% construction cost for down 20%

837
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,592
Simultaneously most of our competitors were ripping Quest out of their p&l trying to chase

838
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,944
The cost down as their sales were defending it was a vicious cycle

839
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,344
We said this is a time to build competitive advantage and ultimately we tripled the stock through the recession

840
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Run I don't I don't want to end

841
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
Without asking you about

842
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
About Luke

843
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Can your lungs

844
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Time business partner

845
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Is it it seems

846
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
You guys have this

847
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Amazing

848
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,448
Very successful partnership and and I know

849
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Lou passed away

850
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
In mm

851
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
I just do it like how did you

852
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
Is most people most Partnerships

853
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Breakdown

854
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
People fight they get jealous

855
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
Angry to get resentful like

856
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Did you add

857
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
Did you have an agreement how are you able to work so well together

858
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
What first of all describe love

859
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Lewis R version

860
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Blake Carrington

861
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,512
He was direct from Central

862
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
And he looked the part

863
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
People lovely

864
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
And Lou

865
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Probably

866
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Was at his best

867
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
In relationships in building

868
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
Relationships and end

869
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
I was the guy who

870
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
Who really thought deeply about the business

871
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Who ran the business in May.

872
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
In lieu and Ice partnership worked

873
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
Because we understood each other

874
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Turn up six times more stock than him

875
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
But most of

876
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
The the community that point

877
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,792
Undoubtedly thought the company was loose

878
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
That was twenty years his Junior I was the guy

879
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Who is yuno work with low

880
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
He was

881
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Harper College and major fundraiser for Harvard

882
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
He was on the Covenant staff in the Marine Corps

883
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
In lieu

884
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
Was able to

885
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
Through his relationships

886
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Develop the real estate

887
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
And he had the real estate

888
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
And I couldn't

889
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Turn into something

890
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
And so we were perfect

891
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Each other and both of us

892
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Till the day he died

893
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Took care of each other

894
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:47,168
So last year Panera sold was acquired sold to a a German

895
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Company JB holding

896
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Why did you say

897
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Real simple

898
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
Because what had allowed us to have this

899
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Powerful success

900
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,760
Was his ability to make long-term transformative smart.

901
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
The reality is in the public market

902
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
I was deeply worried we would not be able to

903
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,952
Continue to do that you were on Wall Street to answer the Wall Street you cannot do that

904
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,536
No I do know what the truth is I probably could cuz I voted seven

905
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,632
19% of the stock and I had this reputation this credibility

906
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
The problem was what happened if I wasn't there

907
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Yeah I see

908
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,776
And I'm 64 I'm not going to be here forever

909
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,616
How does Panera continue to do the things that I created value

910
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
There's a pervasive sense of short-termism

911
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
That is invaded our Market

912
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
The reality is

913
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
When you have such short-term pressure on our CEOs

914
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
They react

915
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,904
And what that ends up meeting is cost-cutting

916
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
And avoid the kind of transformative

917
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Events

918
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,280
That you wrote the success of Panera

919
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
Anything of value when you have a

920
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
A hundred thousand employees as we do

921
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,192
Can you have as many stores as we do takes time

922
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
And so the reality is as a CEO is a leader

923
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,640
I got to figure out where the world is going I got to know how the world is unfolding

924
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
And I got to make sure my company is positioned

925
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
As the world arrives there

926
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Can't do that

927
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
You

928
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
Toward the end of 2017 you you announced

929
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
That you are stepping down

930
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
Are you finally now that you are

931
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,864
Kind of slowing down and stepped out from the day-to-day stuff

932
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,168
Able to enjoy

933
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Cambridge go

934
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Why you didn't

935
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
What that way

936
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Are you able to enjoy some of that

937
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Money is freedom

938
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
And so I wouldn't

939
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
I wouldn't be foolish until you

940
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,944
Am I don't enjoy it

941
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
You know I bought them in on this

942
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Panels where

943
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm the token entrepreneur

944
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
And you know it that business schools in the world

945
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,464
And I always under so wonderful look what you created

946
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm usually talk about the money

947
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
Yeah I tell him look at you don't understand

948
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
You know

949
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
Don't like the people you work with

950
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,936
If you don't like the doing of the doing the creative process of it

951
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
You're never going to get there

952
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
It's not about going to lunch at

953
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
The club it's not about the finance

954
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
And you better be clear about the entrepreneurial life

955
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
The business Anjou you don't own it

956
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
And this business was with me it still is

957
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Every Minute Of My Life

958
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Turn off in the shower

959
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
When I'm sleeping

960
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
The way

961
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
You develop it that's the way you grow it

962
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
And that's the way you run it and if you're not willing to pay that price

963
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,424
You don't want to do what this is all about

964
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,824
He was CEO for 36 years before officially handing over the reins of Panera Bread in early

965
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,200
2018 late in 2017 after Panera would private again

966
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,320
And 20 years after selling Oban pan to focus on building up Panera

967
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
The company actually bought back

968
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:53,024
Obama Panda 2 brands are once again part of the same family

969
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
Do you have to eat

970
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Lunch at Panera

971
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,192
Panera

972
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Go I don't know

973
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032

974

987
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,136
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

988
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
I know for how you built that and today story comes from Tyson Walters who lives in Los

989
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Angeles

990
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,656
Is dog Harley my Saint Bernard is actually 9 years old now

991
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
And she was a true inspiration behind

992
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
The product

993
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
No Harley like a lot of dogs is lovable but

994
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
Also like a lot of dogs

995
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
She sheds all over the place

996
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Which initially was a big problem because

997
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,344
Tyson wanted to take her everywhere not just to the park but to friends houses

998
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:28,000
So there was a lot of conversations to people before I brought her over as in you're going to vacuum when she leaves

999
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:33,120
Or even riding in cars no one wanted to ride with me because they knew they're going to be full of

1000
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Of hair in Tysons

1001
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
Take this problem very seriously the research and resource like what could I do and there was no solution

1002
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
So I kind of started

1003
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
To create it

1004
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,248
This was around 2011 when Tyson just got out of college and moved

1005
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:54,624
Back in with his parents and they didn't want Harley shedding all over the house either

1006
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
So they thought maybe we can design some kind of bodysuit for you know something's are really good

1007
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Get all that hair and

1008
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Keep it in

1009
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,144
And something that was possible for the dog to

1010
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
So

1011
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:13,312
You know the first idea started from just a blanket and kind of messing around with. And trying to make some leg holes

1012
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Everything from like more of a net probably imagine how this all went down

1013
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,832
Tyson and his mom worked with an old sewing machine in the living room

1014
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:31,232
Tried a bunch of different designs and we finally kind of came up with Alexis look like a baggy shirt that the dog wore

1015
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
But the shirt was too baggy in the fabric wasn't breathable enough until

1016
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
Tyson and his mom basically hit a wall

1017
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:45,056
Craigslist and he found a professional seamstress she could see it in her head better and

1018
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
And then she would recommend different materials to Stats when she started bringing you into stretchy material kind of like the Under Armour and

1019
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Nike athletic shirts

1020
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
DC

1021
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,112
That's when it finally came together and what day eventually came up with

1022
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Who is this

1023
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,256
Form-fitting suit kind of like body Spanx for dogs different colors

1024
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
And 9 different sizes

1025
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
From Chihuahua

1026
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
The Great Dane

1027
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
Most dogs are actually okay with it

1028
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,264
The fabric sew stretchy really doesn't hinder their movement at all

1029
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
It's a very lightweight

1030
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:22,944
And I would double-check with beds and stuff like that and I'll give it to you okay as well but remember the whole point

1031
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,344
Is to keep your dog's hair from winding up all over your house or your car all there is is contained

1032
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,744
Pretty much in a suit so you just take it off outside you can shake it out

1033
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
Weird looks going to get from your neighbors

1034
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
Most people's reaction as they laugh

1035
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,704
They last and say what is this and you have to see this to believe me because

1036
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,800
What I looked at all the pictures of these dogs in their Spanx

1037
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,872
I almost wondered whether they were kind of embarrassed

1038
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,271
Are you a Tyson called his dog suit the shed Defender he found a manufacturer in San Francisco and

1039
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,671
Things really took off when a website called dodo.com posted a piece about them give us a real

1040
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
Big Boost once we launched and it's all been free advertisement

1041
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Susan of these shed Defenders and his company has grossed more than $1000000 since he got it going back in

1042
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
In 2016

1043
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,823
And by the way it is not just an

1044
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,919
Indoor suit a lot of owners use the shed Defender outside the

1045
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,783
Keep their dogs Clean and Free of ticks and if your dog needs to go

1046
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,183
Well there's also a zipper so you just partially unzip it the space is wide enough

1047
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
For the dog too

1048
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,303
Use the restroom and then once they come back and you can just

1049
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Zip it on up

1050
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
