No orders so is not a cell to be had it was terrifying and horrible horrible

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
And we almost I really contemplated that Mama this is a failure we need to shut this business down we need to give whatever remains of the money

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496

End of the 1980s

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
At age 13

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
I was getting ready to officially become

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
I'm at the stage in which according to Jewish tradition

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
Boys enter manhood and they have a bar mitzvah

38
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Party

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,048
Set up a chair and paraded around a dance floor you serve salmon

00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Chicken you get the idea

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,680
About eight or nine months before the big day

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
I remember going with my mom to a stationery store to look at

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
Kinds of invitations amp

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Which act out fonts

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Going with burgundy black and gold

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
You put down a deposit

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
It was a long process

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,648
Compare that to when my son was born 25 years later

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
Illini uploaded a photo of his

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232

Everyone on my list received a beautiful birth announcement in the mail

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Thank you internet

57
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:58,688
Now this is the revolution Miriam nafisi tapped into in 2007 when she launched minted

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
But what differentiates minted

59
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
Is a major pivot Marianne would make early on

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Because instead of just

61
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
Selling personalized holiday cards are wedding invitations

62
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Miriam

63
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
How to build a platform for artists

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
To Showcase their work

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
And she did this by tapping into another Revolution

66
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
What was happening in the early 2000s

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Crowdsourcing

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
But before minted was

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Even a thought in his mind

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
She written the.com wave of the late 90s

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
For the company called e

72
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
It was a website that sold

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Cosmetics

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
At a very young age

75
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Miriam and her partner manage to sell it

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Before the.com

77
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Anything about Miriam is that

78
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Launching to successful companies

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
She never intended to become an entrepreneur

80
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
Miriam grew up in

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Tehran

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Her mom was an artist originally from

83
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
China

84
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Her dad was in

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Harvest

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
From a rock

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
And toward the end of the 1970s

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
As the situation

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
In Iran became more volatile

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
The family

91
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Decided to

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Backup

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
And flea

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
You know the environment

95
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Was unstable and

96
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
We did not realize it was very clear what was going to happen

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
I think that we were we were really worried

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
About what would happen to us

99
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
In the new regime so

100
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
And I guess my dad thinks of us as refugees

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,423
Which is when you leave on willingly when we got here

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Hey was the

103
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
Hey yes soon after we arrived these hostage crisis started

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
And that was not a

105
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Great time

106
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
To be Iranian in the US

107
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
And being a kid in school that was

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Really gif

109
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,903
I basically really honestly tried to americanize and fit in as fast as I possibly could

110
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,535
I really wanted to integrate and I when I came here I actually had a pretty at a strong accent

111
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
I was

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Two years younger than everybody in my class all the way

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Through basically school I was

114
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
2 years younger so I was

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
Small Smogon

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
And I just I'd really wanted to be American and honestly I sort of feel like the whole time even when I wasn't

117
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
You know an outsider there as well as you're always

118
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
If you're like me and your

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
You move around alot in your

120
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
I've mixed cultures you're never really going to feel like you

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Belong to one place or one culture right you're always going to feel a little bit like The Outsider who traveling through time and space as an observer

122
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Will you break a signal ticket

123
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
I was I was I was

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
Nerdy girl who sat at the front of the class with glasses on who everybody wanted to get

125
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Help from their homework

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Quiet

127
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
I would say quiet and I'm pretty competitive

128
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
And

129
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
As a kid did you

130
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Have any real

131
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Business Iran

132
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Entrepreneurial

133
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Stuff

134
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
No might my parents

135
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
I come from a completely non busy

136
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Family

137
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
And

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Honestly

139
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
You know what Iranian upper-class

140
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,287
Yeah you didn't you didn't you didn't set up business assertive vivanta thing that one goes into

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Things that were in in my family very

142
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
I admired with things like being a doctor

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Going into Foreign Service in the government

144
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,855
So when I was growing up in Chevy Chase not once did business crossed my mind I was thinking

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Law and I

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
I do remember my mom

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
On the first day of

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
First grade

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Bending down

150
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
To say to me something

151
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,423
And she said I want you to go to school and I want you to be all of the boys

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,359
To you you actually went onto to call to Williams College

153
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
What did you do

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
What did you do after you graduate

155
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
So

156
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
That's where I did do the the expected

157
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Saying is some of my fellow

158
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,743
Classmates who were in economics and policy were interviewing for jobs

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm lost

160
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,631
Management consulting firms and those firms had these huge process he's on campus recruiting process

161
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
So I went to Goldman Sachs as a financial analyst in their Investment Banking division

162
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
And you loved it

163
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,967
I can't say that I love being a financial analyst that it is sore Like Loving bootcamp

164
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
I don't know if you're familiar with it but you you end up

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Working very long hours

166
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
But

167
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
I will say it's a great training ground as to what work ethic really means

168
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Because you can't imagine working harder than then

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
What you actually physically pull off

170
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,887
As a financial analyst like 22 or 21

171
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
And you probably moving to New York end

172
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
And all you were doing was working

173
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
All I was doing was working so I was 20 and I was where I was eating breakfast

174
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Just lunch and dinner at the office

175
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
And I was actually selling I had a desk on the bond

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Trading floor and I was selling bonds

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
As well as doing it working with client

178
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
So before I could actually drink I was selling bonds

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
So if I could drink legally

180
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
So you AHS if you were doing this for

181
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
A couple years and then

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Addison Point you

183
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Decide to go to

184
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
To business who are you

185
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Were you thinking your mind like okay

186
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
Business school and then

187
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
So what happened was

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
The first was just thinking

189
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
About

190
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Going to business school because

191
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
I'd actually

192
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Johnson

193
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Investment banking

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
A management consulting and

195
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
I thought perhaps I would want to go into

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Consumer products

197
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,879
Fairy Tail but I didn't get into Stanford the first time I applied

198
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
Shop for business school and so I decided to

199
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Take your off and try to boost my

200
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
Resume with something that was a little bit more differentiated

201
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
And

202
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Went to work for an entrepreneur

203
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Maurice werdegar

204
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
In the restaurant business actually

205
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Who was the

206
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Stanford grad

207
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
And he became a key mentor

208
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Starting a chain of restaurants

209
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
In Palo Alto

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Oliver California

211
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
But I was

212
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Sew in

213
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,343
Tired and bitten with the entrepreneurial bug during that experience and more importantly said to me

214
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
You really

215
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
You really could do that youku

216
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Start a company you think

217
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
You should really consider it

218
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Because we would spend hours talking about

219
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Ariel ideas

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Capital

221
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,119
And just got becoming completely obsessed with the point where I thought

222
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Why go to Business School

223
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,775
We lunch but it doesn't go to this yeah I'm not even interested anymore and that that's why I thought all right

224
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,663
I'll play one more time because my boyfriend who became my husband was applying at that alright let's all throw my hat in the ring one more time

225
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Antenna Stanford

226
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Accepting me

227
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
So you go to Business School

228
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Wow at Business School

229
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
The hell is book called

230
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
The fast track The Insider's Guide to winning jobs in management consulting

231
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Investment banking

232
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Insecurities reading a book

233
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
Thistle like 50000 copy

234
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,495
Is that very precocious and that's like super like that is

235
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Overdrive

236
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Precocious

237
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
Yes of the reason I did that was I thought well one it's a market

238
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,319
Recruiting at the two firms I was working at that I knew that there was a need for the book

239
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
And I wanted to experiment to see what happen if you created

240
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,231
Consumer product that you know that there's a need for can you can actually put a frog together and sell it

241
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
And I also thought it would be a good project to demonstrate that I had some

242
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,679
I guess it's fun to be able to get in at Stanford

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
I sold the book right and then I

244
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
I knew I'd sold the book to a publisher Broadway

245
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Before I

246
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
As I was applying and I think that help differentiate me

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
As well

248
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
Pay for school

249
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
So at stanford edu

250
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Did Russia have a business

251
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
Planner idea that you want supper

252
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Put together

253
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
Well I started the second half of the year

254
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
First of all

255
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Second half of the year at Stanford I was taking every on

256
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Tornado class I could and trying desk

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Early to get into the Best glasses

258
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
So is auditing Sam sitting on the floor of others

259
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
And then working on plans and

260
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
One thing I need

261
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,015
That I wanted to do is find a partner that I really liked so I called a friend of mine in New York

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,135
And tried to convince her to come to San Francisco and start something with me and we had two ideas

263
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
And she said well start

264
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
A company if we if we pursue my idea

265
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Which is selling Cosmetics online

266
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Mine was to do market research online

267
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Find sort of like a survey monkey

268
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
What was her name

269
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Varsha Rao

270
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,775
So we decided to pursue

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,615
Cosmetics that I thought sure why not I want to work with you and I need to get

272
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
Typical visitor come out to let's work on Cosmetics II views Cosmetics before

273
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
We can figure this out

274
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
And so I convinced her to move out

275
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
To come to San Francisco

276
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
To help

277
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
You start a

278
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
An online

279
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Cosmetics

280
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
And she

281
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,863
Slept on the couch in our studio apartment or 1-bedroom apartment

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
And in the morning we get up in our pajamas so we wouldn't wake up

283
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
My now-husband

284
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
And we sit on the couch and call all the New York

285
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Cosmetics companies from our couch

286
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Papa John's

287
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
And

288
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Canvas people

289
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Go to sign on with us

290
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
To distribute on this thing called the internet

291
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Which most people

292
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
We were extremely suspicious of

293
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
So that was a

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
So the business was going to be

295
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
An online store selling

296
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
All kinds of Cosmetics did I ever even brands that was the idea

297
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
That's right so the idea was

298
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
To create ever

299
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Replenishment brand

300
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Cosmetics

301
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
What's a good many things that you want to replenish skin care hair care you know your favorite Angela replenish it because

302
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
At that point everybody was telling us

303
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Nobody was going to buy Cosmetics online that they've never tried

304
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
Moreover women don't shop online

305
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
That's a fact

306
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
Yes women don't shop online and nobody will ever buy

307
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
Make a call in line and I'll just stay in my career

308
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
It has happened repeatedly right where people will say

309
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
But everything all of those things have been said

310
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
So when you approach a small brands

311
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,503
I'm just saying online ourselves why were they

312
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
Attracted to what you guys referring

313
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Well in those days

314
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,279
Solution that would easily allow small brand are so online I know it sounds crazy but there was no solution

315
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
And so

316
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,703
First of all nobody wanted to sell online we would have to go in there and convince them that the internet was not bad

317
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,775
We also actually hired a woman from

318
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Macy's

319
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
It was formerly from me at Macy's has a big

320
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Manager of the Cosmetics business

321
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Said she ended up being our River guide

322
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Making introductions

323
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
For us helping advise us

324
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,903
If you go to Chanel where the Chanel nail polish for example that was that wants to die

325
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
They'll recognize their colors on you

326
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
2 Yuan varsha Empire

327
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Michael

328
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Michael is a

329
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,935
YouVersion like Alexa listening in this apartment

330
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Yuan varsha decide

331
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
You are going to start an online

332
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
Cosmetic store which today doesn't sound like that

333
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Big big deal but I guess in 1998 that was kind of revolutionary

334
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
Right nobody was selling Cosmetics online nobody

335
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Can you believe literally know what though

336
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
I wish I could go back and start a Cosmetics company

337
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah and then he notes

338
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,839
Start a company yo I basically took a white sheet of paper out and started drawing a website

339
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
On a white sheet of paper in my kitchen along with another sheet of paper where I was

340
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Trying to come up with metric

341
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
As to what I would call

342
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Different

343
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Things like people coming to your site and

344
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,687
What would you call the metric or someone converts into a customer

345
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,015
And everything had to be invented Little League for the first time

346
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Then we went through

347
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Really

348
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Insane

349
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
You're so if I graduated in 1998

350
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
We

351
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Immediately started fundraising

352
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
But what was it was it

353
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Easy to raise money in 1998

354
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
1998 it was

355
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
Getting pretty easy 1999 was crazy

356
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Just cuz it was a.com boom but it was getting there and I sent

357
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,199
What's an opportunity from for me to get Capital even though it's 27

358
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
And

359
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,063
Had no work experience

360
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,159
They love our pets they loved us and they loved our pitch and we had a lot of interest

361
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
And

362
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
We ended up in an interesting situation where

363
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
We we did experience

364
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,631
Some collusion actually this is a really difficult part of that Journey where

365
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
In the old days

366
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
You can have easy friends

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Gang up

368
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
If they could find out who else you were talking to

369
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
They conclude and basically

370
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Work with each other

371
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
And partner together

372
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
2

373
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
Drive your price down evaluation down

374
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,575
And I had heard about it at business school in a lecture and it sure enough it happened it happened to me so

375
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
Wait a couple timesheets come in

376
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Farrar

377
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
First round

378
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Financing

379
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
And it was ideal Ava plus a couple of others

380
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
But

381
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Two of the firms

382
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Decided

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
The first I found out about

384
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
We were talking to Andy decided to collude

385
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
So we signed a term sheet with one player

386
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
And they were valuing us

387
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Straight out of the blocks Justice

388
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
People images PowerPoint presentation at six million dollars

389
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Pretty good right

390
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Yes it was meant that we were very happy we it was a

391
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,087
A prestigious firm office on Sand Hill Sand Hill Road

392
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
But they turned around and actually

393
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,999
Decided to partner with another firm and they called us and said

394
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
We're sorry

395
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
This is now their deal

396
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
The times are changing

397
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
The terms now became

398
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
We need to move

399
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Cities to where this other firm is

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
We're going to bring the valuation down to 4 million

401
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
And it was a collision

402
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Straighten like a textbook collusion

403
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
This is like Darth Vader territory like that

404
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Terms have changed

405
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Explain to me

406
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
How that work

407
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
How that was like allowed to happen

408
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
Yes at the term sheet is

409
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Unfortunately not

410
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Binding it say

411
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
Indication of Interest that's really a buildup of good faith

412
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
And so if you could do and get away with it absolutely it happened a lot in

413
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
You know in that the night late 90s when

414
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
You didn't have online

415
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Transparency in tenrec

416
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Meditation

417
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
Where other entrepreneurs can learn

418
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
About what people are doing to you

419
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
And so there was no

420
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Consequence

421
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
And so

422
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Become an investor much more abusive

423
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
So what did you

424
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
What'd you tell him

425
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
They said this for million bucks and they hear you

426
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
So

427
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
What's fascinating is we had not yet

428
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Call Bill gross to tell him that we were turning him down

429
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
So gross

430
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
This was the guy who

431
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Idealab

432
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
In Pasadena so we had had the third term sheet

433
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,007
And we were planning to call him but we just didn't have the time we hadn't had the time to call him

434
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Instead of calling him

435
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,615
How to turn him down we put the phone down with the other group we pick the phone up

436
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,199
We called all gross and we said we're signing your timesheet will be in Pasadena tomorrow

437
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
And we

438
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Exit at the side door

439
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
See you at you raising money

440
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
It's 98

441
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
How long

442
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Between a Time

443
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
That

444
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
You went to investors

445
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
Receive money and you actually launched the website

446
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,007
We took the money and in 1998 and we launched in July 1999

447
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
And what describe

448
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Play what you mentioned the name of the website was

449
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
I'm sorry that your name was eve.com

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,271
And like Adam but Eve Eve yes

451
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
So when you launch t.com

452
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,695
Did the people find out about right away I had these people didn't know where to go and have a look

453
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,303
Yep so we we ended up with a massive amount of press coverage

454
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
And

455
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
She had a lot of money for marketing

456
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
And we were encouraged to spend it

457
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,007
At that time it was landgraab time everybody was trying to grab market share as fast as they could

458
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
We launched in and they were for competitors who launched right behind us

459
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
And

460
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
One of the big things I learned to do is just

461
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Completely block out

462
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
Any fear or notion of a competitor's keep your head down

463
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
And to the minute we open the doors of literally the product

464
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Started

465
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
Selling ridiculously quickly. I mean we did 10 million dollars in sales in our first year

466
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Merryweather runaway you're given that it was our first year business

467
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
Amazing you were so young and you were like yeah

468
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
But we were

469
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
Lest anyone be confused are we were

470
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:29,663
Working till 10 at night every night in the office and this is what investment banking background keto candy cuz we were trained

471
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
To operate like that

472
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
Any of my husband would come meet me at the office at 10 and we have dinner at 10:30 every night

473
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
To you

474
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
In mm

475
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
A year-and-a-half

476
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Do you watch

477
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
You guys get an offer

478
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
And

479
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,631
You sell this company eve.com sold for 110 million dollars

480
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,495
I don't even want to ask a question why I'm it seems obvious

481
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
It was a lot of money in

482
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
A no-brainer is

483
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Yes right

484
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Bright so

485
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,735
This is a time when we were trying to raise a series D and honestly the market

486
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
Was starting to get a little skeptical when you're ready to make a profit what's going on

487
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
And so I start for the first time in that

488
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
For the 14th

489
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,999
60 month. I started realizing that getting the next round was going to be difficult

490
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
And we could take

491
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Have Safe Harbor for the company inside another company

492
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
I thought it would probably a wise move and

493
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
We closed it in April 2000

494
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
Two weeks later the market

495
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Starcrash

496
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Plow

497
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
So you made it

498
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Just like butter

499
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Scan your teeth

500
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Yeah we we yes

501
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Premier the foot-in-the-door

502
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
At the doors closing

503
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
What are other people in your position

504
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
In the industry who maybe didn't

505
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Have as good

506
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Penang

507
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
As you guys did who were

508
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
I don't know

509
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Baby brezza

510
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Temple of

511
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Black Air Force

512
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
I think there were a lot of cases where people

513
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,239
Were convinced by investors or convince themselves to

514
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
To keep going and wait for the public exit

515
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
Because clearly that's when everybody was in everybody was

516
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
Enamored of the IPO

517
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
And I do think people were resentful of us

518
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
For this in the end they considered it

519
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Lucky verses

520
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
Is any type of hard work or Intuition or anything else

521
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
And

522
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
That that was unfortunate as we worked our butts off to build this business

523
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,584
I mean we were working lived at the office

524
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
During this time I never laughed

525
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
So

526
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
Without a pretty good business in a year it was

527
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
10 million dollars our first year

528
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,616
Yet yes people were I think we're very resentful that we have sold at the right time

529
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
So

530
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Did you just like

531
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Go to Hawaii and Light

532
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Kick it and drink pina coladas

533
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,136
I did take a year off and my husband and I traveled around it's true but

534
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,536
About two months into it I got I was absolutely miserable I felt like I was missing out on what would happen

535
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Nnnnn fundamentally

536
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
There was a perception that

537
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
We got lucky

538
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Woodtv.com

539
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
End

540
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
I had this

541
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Feeling that

542
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,568
Yeah you did that saying once

543
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
You're lucky twice you're good

544
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
I wanted to

545
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
See if I was actually good or not

546
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,552
And so I think I needed to prove to myself that I could do it again

547
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
In just a moment how Miriam got into the stationery business and almost abandoned it

548
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,584
Right before stumbling on an idea that would transform the entire

549
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Tire industry

550

I asked Miriam to run

587
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
But after a few years working for a big

588
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Company

589
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Miriam Stark

590
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Getting that entrepreneurial itch

591
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Once again

592
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,416
Will you have entrepreneurial Tendencies sometimes you'll see something that

593
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
You can't resist

594
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
And

595
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,352
I saw I saw a change in what consumers are willing and excited about consuming and so for example

596
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
Bloggers were starting to emerge that were disrupting

597
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
Journalist said it really established institutions and

598
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,848
Consumers are willing to read them over those established institutions

599
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
And there was great talent coming to the four

600
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
It's okay

601
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,016
I would think to myself that perhaps in product design they would be

602
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
A similar opportunity

603
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
That you could find talented designers

604
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
That people would rather buy than the not talented

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,584
Interested in the idea of having design competitions in this idea of crowdsourcing

606
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
And so I

607
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,472
Decided to take stationary which was an interesting model for me

608
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
And mash it up with

609
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Kind of experimental idea

610
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Which way is crowdsourcing

611
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
If you better a friend a copy

612
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Coffee shop

613
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
And they said

614
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
You would say

615
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
I'm working on this

616
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
This business is going to do

617
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
What like what what what

618
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,512
At that point I would have said we're going to sell stationery online

619
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
What sounds

620
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Sounds pretty clear

621
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:44,704
Yep and it was one foot back in the old world is just take the brands consolidate them online and sell them

622
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,032
There is a slightly embarrassing idea I had which was to

623
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
Garden design competition around the side and crowd-sourced designs

624
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
They weren't available through

625
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Established

626
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
Stationery Brands and I was going to do that

627
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
On the side

628
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,576
In other words you at you said I'm going to have a site to sell stationery and then

629
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
I'm outside we're going to run like design competitions end

630
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,000
And maybe we can develop stationary based on the winner of that design competition

631
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
That's right exactly

632
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,424
The idea was focused around stationary retail and it had fantastic economics

633
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,240
Associated with that good margins it was

634
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Inherently viral product

635
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
Cuz your name is on the back of the card your

636
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Your company name

637
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
The shopping experience offline mode

638
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Was pretty archaic

639
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,248
If you go to a store there be a piece of paper you to fill out

640
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
Order some custom cars that have a fax it in

641
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
To this supplier it was an archaic

642
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Slow and really inconvenient process

643
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
And

644
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,256
I thought in my opinion the design could be improved greatly

645
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
And that gave me an opening

646
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
For crowd

647
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
On the one hand on the other hand

648
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,984
Is a little bit honestly a little bit risk-averse and I thought

649
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
That

650
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,336
I did not want to raise Venture Capital again because I

651
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
Had had some bumpy experiences

652
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
In the first in the first go-round

653
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
So I thought

654
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
I need to find a business model to apply this idea to

655
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
That is very very cash flow positive

656
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
And doesn't require a lot of cash

657
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
And I'm going to run it as a castle busy

658
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
A business that can

659
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Just self-fund right

660
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
Because of the rapid ride yet

661
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,960
So you didn't want to have to raise a lot of money but you still had to raise some money

662
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
Right

663
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
So at this point I was going to friends

664
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
And because I had to

665
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
Successfully sold Eve they were willing to listen and so

666
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
I was actually able to raise a

667
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
The pretty big angel

668
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Around

669
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Up 2 and 1/2 million dollars

670
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
Switches bag furniture

671
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
So you decided you weren't even going to go to BC

672
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
That's right at this point I

673
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,816
Wanted much more control I decided not to have a co-founder from the outside

674
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
And so I

675
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Put the plan together

676
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,960
And what I found was many of

677
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,800
My friends were a little bit they were very very supportive incredibly supportive

678
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
But they were all a little bit

679
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Wariye crowdsource

680
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Because it was

681
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Not a tried-and-true model.

682
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
What was tried-and-true is Ecommerce 1.0 which is

683
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Is take all the brand names

684
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Put them online

685
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
And provide convenient

686
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Access online

687
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
Yeah that's what I did I signed up all the stationery brands

688
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Online and in the end in the background I

689
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,816
Tire decoder who's in college

690
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
In Portland

691
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
And

692
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Add work at night

693
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,192
On the competition structure which was my real passion

694
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Which was to try to crowdsource

695
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
Series about 2 and 1/2 million dollars and Angel

696
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Funding and you

697
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,432
Are ready to launch this site

698
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,016
Which is going to sell stationary by the way how many people did you

699
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Hire did you bring a board to help

700
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
If you launch it

701
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,648
To launch minted I had virtually no one

702
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
The word Maybe

703
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Five of us

704
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Something like that and I

705
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
That's when I raised

706
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
I finished the angel round

707
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
Wassup blood little bit of space in Jackson

708
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Square

709
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Family started with just a few people first year and who built the website

710
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
How did you do that

711
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,384
So we spent almost all the two and a half million on an in-house team

712
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
Two came on board at engineer

713
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,040
And the key challenge was how to render

714
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
The customization of your stationery online that was

715
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
And that was that was assuming we could buy off the shelf

716
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
From anyone

717
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
So we have to build it ourselves

718
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,584
A way to be able to see what you are stationary would look like

719
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
That's right so our Engineers built

720
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
A way to see

721
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Your customized text

722
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Appear on the screen in inside your stationery design

723
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
And that you couldn't buy from any other

724
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Technology company

725
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
So

726
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
I spent most of the two and a half million dollars are raised

727
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,320
Going around signing up all these exclusives with stationery brands that

728
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,160
You would see out of Papyrus store for example you you see them

729
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,488
They've already gotten distribution their well-known wedding brands

730
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Thick eyebrows

731
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,328
I spent most the time in the money doing that and then

732
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
I just couldn't let go of this other thing that was

733
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
Really risky unproven which was to have a design competition

734
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,824
I really really wanted to let myself do that but I just couldn't let myself do it was a

735
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
The top of the stairs so

736
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,480
At night I worked with a college student who I found on rent a coder which is embarrassing to admit

737
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
We worked on this at night

738
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,880
After everyone that message went home I would build the competition structure with the sky

739
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
And

740
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,768
I really wanted to do that full-time but I just I just didn't let myself

741
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
April 2008 you launch minted

742
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,936
And and you're like the doors open the shingles out

743
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,752
You're excited you pop the champagne Corks And

744
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Nothing

745
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,592
Nothing absolute dead silence

746
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
It was not a cell to be had it was

747
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Terrifying and

748
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Horrible

749
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Horrible

750
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
Woody will we open the doors in the makeup was just

751
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Flying out from day one

752
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
This massive amount of sales

753
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
There is not one thing sold in the first 30 days not one sale

754
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,304
And we almost I really kind of late at that moment this is a failure

755
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,400
We need to shut this business down need to give whatever remains of the money back to investors

756
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
Because it's it's it's a total failure

757
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
Did you at least have

758
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Positive Buzz around it

759
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,640
We had a really negative article from TechCrunch

760
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,736
What does it's a terrible idea this Christmas fail before

761
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
But I think that they didn't even understand that we had you know it's so successfully sold the company for as much money as we did

762
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Yes

763
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,744
So they just made some assumptions and had just terrible

764
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,584
Like I was a freshman RW and

765
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
So what happened why this is what was really fascinating when you look back on it is we just didn't have enough data and so what happened with weed and

766
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Traffic to really

767
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:44,640
Assess whether we were successful or not because nobody nobody knew about us and nobody was coming

768
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,712
And then when they did come what they were buying where the

769
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,624
Tiny little Kraut Source selection that I mentioned to you that I was my little personal secret hobby passion

770
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
Explain how that work

771
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
Prefer mom yasso

772
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:04,096
So when we open our doors in April we had our very first design competition for what people called save-the-date cards that people set up

773
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
About to get married

774
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,448
And and we had very few entries

775
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,520
And I think what would happen is we pick something like

776
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
66

777
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Cards

778
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,432
Out of that competition based on voting so the way that made it works is everything

779
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Is submitted To Us by a design

780
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
We picked about sick

781
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
66

782
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Designs

783
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
And we launched

784
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Those we had

785
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,440
Hundreds if not actually thousands of skus that we were carrying

786
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
Established

787
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
He said save the date

788
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:38,400
That already said the save the date or wedding with it was all all sorts of things wedding invitations other things

789
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
People provide

790
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
And we lost all of that station a wedding station

791
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,544
Free product online and then just our little tiny collection of 60

792
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
T6 crowdsource save-the-date

793
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
What was

794
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Really different is that

795
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
Immediately the submissions that we're coming in

796
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
Or breaking

797
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
A lot of

798
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Barriers a lot of

799
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
Molds that have been assumed about that

800
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
Category product for example

801
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
People started putting photos

802
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,792
And I remember our printer who we signed up to do this tiny little bit of business at West you know what

803
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,120
In our industry people don't put photos on Save the Day card

804
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
They don't do that

805
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
I said I understand but

806
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
That's what's actually being submitted and that's what the winning

807
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
So we're going to sell them

808
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,128
Yeah so what happened was within a couple of months we started getting

809
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Let's say

810
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
One order a day

811
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Seriously one order a day maybe by June

812
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
And then

813
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
No a month after that it went

814
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
What two orders a day

815
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Maybe three orders

816
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,208
Still nothing to write home about and then probably not

817
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
You're running out of cash

818
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Absolutely

819
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
Are Runway at this one is running out

820
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
Are conversion rate which is a critical metric that e commerce

821
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Companies use to determine success

822
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,312
Was something like .1% meeting out of all the people who come

823
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
.1% by

824
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
And that is really really low

825
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
You're in trouble

826
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Mike nervous

827
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
Yes and we have seen a couple hundred thousand dollars left in the bank

828
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:04,160
But then we start seeing the tiny set of life I thought well maybe what I can do

829
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Is

830
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
Take some Capital at least save this business

831
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
Just to be Coop the initial investment and that's it

832
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
So

833
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
My good friend and Angel one of my really good friend

834
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
Alex lieske called me and said

835
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
No I'm skinny

836
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
Getting nervous about this Market

837
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,384
I think you should take some Capital institutional capital

838
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
And I thought you know I feel the same way

839
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Hittite I should get on it

840
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
So I went out and I decided

841
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
To break my own Rule and x-ray Centre

842
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Capital

843
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
And we raised in

844
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
We basically

845
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Close our first

846
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
She's around

847
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,328
Of capital so that's where we raised a couple million dollars how were you able to

848
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
To do that if you

849
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
If you

850
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
If what you had to show for was a company that was getting

851
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
No orders

852
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
You're losing my quickly

853
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Like why would a venture capital

854
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
Term give you cash it up

855
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
That's a great question guy

856
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Yeah that's a great question

857
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
So

858
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
The reason why they invested in this

859
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Southwest

860
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Personal reputation

861
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
That was a delivered one thing successful

862
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Play before and

863
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
This one braid investor

864
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
From idg

865
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
Now Ridge Ventures

866
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Alex Rosen decided to take a chance on

867
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
And that's it that's the only reason

868
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
And nobody else was into

869
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
Do you think I don't want to I don't wanna put you in on

870
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Position

871
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984
I am but do you think that I'm going to do it anyway

872
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,824
Question

873
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
Do you think if you would have been a man

874
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
There been no doubt

875
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
Oh yeah stationary sounds great here's the money

876
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,088
I think that if I were a man I would

877
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Probably

878
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:45,280
I have gotten a little bit more credit for what I previously delivered I think a personal reputation effective would have happened with Eve would have

879
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:52,448
But I don't think stationary was very and design was right interesting to a lot of mail venture capitalist and I

880
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
I don't think that

881
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,360
When I say Silicon Valley doesn't have design confidence I mean the

882
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,408
Investors in Silicon Valley

883
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
Don't really understand

884
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Design and why it's important

885
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,112
So when you so explain that the business model I mean obviously

886
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
You are selling

887
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
All of the stationery

888
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Play from from other brands

889
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
And so you would get it cut it

890
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Thunder

891
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Business words spelled that would bring in Revenue

892
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
But also you had this crowdsourced

893
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Decapitations from designers

894
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
And then

895
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
How that work like they would

896
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,592
There their designs would be

897
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,664
Imprinted by you guys and then they would get a cat a bath

898
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,504
The way it works back then was that we had the stationery brands

899
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,112
Basically in a wholesale relationship with we would take the product and resell it and

900
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
And earn a cut

901
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
And we had the Kraut source

902
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Seidwear

903
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Designers would submit

904
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
End

905
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
They would receive a couple things they first of all they would receive

906
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,400
Peer critique and feedback from their peers will be built in a

907
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Critique face

908
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Which was

909
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
A benefit

910
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:03,360
And second if they won they would receive an upfront cash prize that was completely at our rest meaning

911
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
It's never so they can still keep

912
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
The cash

913
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
And then on top of that if the product sold

914
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
They would receive a percentage

915
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Of every cell and so

916
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,136
That's how the business model launched but because

917
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
The only thing that sold with the crowdsource product in not

918
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
What we spent the entire year

919
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,048
Launching which is all the stationery brands

920
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
We actually

921
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
Made a hard cut over and buy

922
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Christmas of that year

923
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
We went

924
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
100% crossword

925
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
And so we turned it around we actually decided to move into the holiday cards

926
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Against the advice of all of our

927
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
Investors who

928
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,528
Probably rightly said you should focus on what you started with his wedding

929
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
We decided to ignore the advice

930
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Launch the holiday cards

931
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
And we were

932
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
We had an

933
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
Exceptional first Christmas Amy Weber

934
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
So

935
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Oversold

936
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
It was actually shut off our marketing research marketing there are points

937
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Because we're getting too many orders

938
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
So the that's when the company went

939
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Two huge

940
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Increase in sales

941
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
So what point did you

942
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Decided drop

943
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Selling

944
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Other station

945
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,224
Yeah so that was really rough because

946
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
I had gone

947
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
Minted as a partner to all of these stationery Brands and I felt very

948
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Ethically

949
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
Sounds like a you know I've made a commitment

950
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Explain why we brought them on

951
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
And now instead this crowdsourced

952
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
Design coming from unknown designers from all over the country is

953
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Just taking off

954
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
And I felt very

955
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,288
Uncomfortable and I and I was lingering in that discomfort for many months

956
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,592
It took me at least nine months to say

957
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Escada cotton run

958
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,176
We're going to lose all the money we put into those

959
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,992
Building out those brands on our site because you just cut that

960
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
And she said all of that work all that money and all those relationships and weed

961
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
Completely pivot towards

962
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
A crowdsourced model 100%

963
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
I'm assuming you had a lot of

964
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Tough conversations with

965
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
Clarion partners

966
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
I did

967
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,960
But I think also they they understood why why tie themselves up selling online at minted if

968
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
If that's just not why

969
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
What's working in the sales aren't happening

970
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
In the meantime

971
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
We couldn't print fast enough

972
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
The work of the

973
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,712
Emerging designers who the customers themselves or picking

974
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,296
So as you start to gain traction those first two years

975
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Did any

976
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
I mean

977
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
Did any competitors

978
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Yes

979
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
2013

980
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
We have

981
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Two printers

982
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,680
We had a Oliver Hardy card orders when does 50

983
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Force at the other one is another for

984
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
First week of October

985
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,056
My cell phone rings at about 5

986
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
It's a CEO of a much larger

987
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Competitor

988
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
And

989
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
They basically say

990
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
We want you to hear the news from us

991
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064

I would love to talk to you about how we can continue supplying you with printing services to the holiday season

995
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,656
This is my two two weeks from the start of the holiday season when

996
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
All of the you-know-what hits

The fan meeting you have to be prepared your spending you know 10 months that you're preparing for this moment because the seasonality so

998
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
So high for holiday cards

999
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
And

1000
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
Basically he said we know can you come in next week to talk to me and invited me I think for the kiss

1001
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
Meeting

1002
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
Next Athena the following week

1003
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,184
So I went into the meeting and

1004
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
After a Lil Bit of chatter

1005
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
He said we'd like to bite you

1006
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
We like to we like to buy your business

1007
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
And

1008
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:43,008
I realized in that moment that that whole thing have been constructed to basically Force us to

1009
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
To sell a business

1010
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
They basically bought that

1011
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Printing

1012
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
Knowing that you guys would be

1013
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
Like

1014
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
That's right

1015
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,088
So what did you do when when he said we want to buy you mean I mean

1016
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,136
Well I was in his office

1017
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,024
Kind of stuck there are so I had to say something so what are you basically said was well let's talk about it let's Howe Avenue

1018
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,912
How would this work and I thought in the meantime God I cannot I got to get out of this meeting right now and call my

1019
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Supply chain

1020
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,824
Start working on this immediately like yeah I left the meeting and I called

1021
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
But the team is awaiting a

1022
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,432
We had a conversation and they were racing around the country

1023
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Try to find

1024
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Actually have to sell

1025
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
No I never feared that we would have to

1026
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
Not once I knew we would find a way around it

1027
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,512
I just I just there's just no way I would let that happen

1028
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
So what did you do I mean

1029
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Where'd you go

1030
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,472
So we found we found another two printers who were gracious enough to

1031
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
To take a saint and we

1032
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
We called

1033
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,384
Still inside the company is called printer get in Edmonton

1034
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,271
Because the amount of work and he'll our people went through to

1035
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
To do that integration at tops

1036
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Speed with

1037
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Dreadful

1038
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
To this day

1039
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
That

1040
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
That that has left

1041
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
Taste in peoples mouth

1042
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Yeah

1043
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,631
Around this potential competitor that still I think it's still there

1044
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
You know

1045
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
At the time I mean

1046
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
What was when they were going after even there were

1047
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Other companies

1048
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
Jordan what you were doing like it would ever come

1049
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Companies doing custom

1050
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Stationer that you can buy

1051
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
That's right

1052
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
So the first generation

1053
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,271
Companies have been around that

1054
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,623
Captivated people just by the sheer fact that they can make custom stationery for you out of diesel

1055
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
The Price is Right that was just

1056
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
An outgrowth of the printing in manufacturing industry frankly

1057
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
We came along with real design

1058
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Vision

1059
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
Andrea Lee

1060
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
Try to change that

1061
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
Entirely into a branded

1062
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
High-end European stationery product with lots

1063
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
2000 West Alden really changed

1064
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
It's the industry

1065
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
So that yes they were choices but we felt the design

1066
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Could be better

1067
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
And more exciting

1068
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,783
And then as this community creative Community blossom in developed we realized that

1069
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
We were a creative community of all kinds of different

1070
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
People

1071
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Some people

1072
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
Who were former lawyers

1073
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
Oil rig worker from Alaska

1074
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
There's a

1075
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,327
Plumber a master plumber in New York City's winning stationary challenges

1076
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,375
There are all kinds of people

1077
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,471
Who want to be creative and he want to earn money creatively admitted is

1078
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
A platform for these people to be seen

1079
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Discovered

1080
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,079
Is minted

1081
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
A profitable company

1082
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,455
Yes so we are in the low hundreds of Millions

1083
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
The dollars in sales

1084
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
And we are even dollar cash deposit

1085
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
Are you able to kind of just

1086
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Relax out

1087
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
No and no

1088
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Your business

1089
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Is fine you'll be fine.

1090
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
Can you go on vacation and

1091
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,583
Disentangle disassociate yourself

1092
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
From work for a while

1093
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
And not

1094
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
He calls like is that

1095
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Or do you still ice

1096
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Always

1097
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Think about the

1098
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
The survival of your

1099
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,335
That's a great question because I think for the first

1100
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
Believe it or not

1101
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
5 reasons

1102
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:05,247
6 years even longer of the company there was constant survivability rest

1103
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Now I feel differently

1104
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,695
I feel like this good company given that it's profitable given that it's going so well

1105
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
It's a great feeling and yes I can breathe this is this the

1106
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,119
Paranoid paranoid immigrant mentality that I have

1107
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
I think

1108
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Grown up with

1109
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
And then of course

1110
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
But yeah couple

1111
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,543
Crashes in other Market

1112
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,151
It is make sense to make you a paranoid person eaten not to forget any of this

1113
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
It just it just stays with you

1114
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,503
But yes I can I can now

1115
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:42,623
Say that a yes I can guy go on a vacation for a week and not worry maybe even two weeks and not worried at all

1116
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
How much of

1117
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Of yours

1118
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Success is

1119
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Purses

1120
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Indulgences

1121
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,959
I think so much of it is lock I mean

1122
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Think about

1123
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
What would have

1124
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Happen if I

1125
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Had not been able to

1126
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
How many people are in areas around the world where

1127
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
The cat

1128
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Escape

1129
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,623
What the situation that their governments are creating for them

1130
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Think about all those talented people

1131
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
Call who won't ever have a check

1132
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
And an N I guess I would say the other thing is

1133
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,607
Just share wanting it very badly right I mean there are there a lot of

1134
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,887
People who are smarter than I am

1135
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:31,263
And I think it's just a really focusing on something I'm happily extremely passionate about and love to think about

1136
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
All the time

1137
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
And I would say that

1138
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,383
Luck and passion probably outweigh the

1139
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:43,039
The Rascals name to CC

1140
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575

00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:02,751

00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
But first

1147
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Quick thanks to one of our sponsors

1148
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
American Express

1149
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
No matter what you do in business

1150
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,239
Building a better mousetrap to building a better app

1151
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
It's easier when you

1152
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
You don't do it alone

1153
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
Powerful backing of American Express

1154
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
Don't do business

1155
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Without it

1156
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,831
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you

1157
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Go back

1158
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,415
And three story comes from Lynn Massachusetts where

1159
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,719
Two sisters have perfected

1160
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
Family recipe

1161
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
I make the stuffing

1162
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
That's

1163
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Casey White

1164
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
Timex Adele

1165
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
And that's her sister Vanessa

1166
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,423
And the dough and stuffing

1167
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
They are for perogies

1168
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Polish dumplings filled with

1169
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Cheese

1170
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Potatoes

1171
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
I'm sausage

1172
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
The grandfather used to sell them at the family Deli

1173
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Massachusetts in middle school I would go there on Saturdays

1174
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
Can help pinched perogies in

1175
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,111
And we always had them in our freezer kind of like our Kraft macaroni and cheese

1176
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
That was at the river

1177
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,719
We just had Frozen for a few days and one

1178
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,815
Your mom would bring them coolers full of pierogies from the deli

1179
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
And by the time I graduated

1180
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
They were still eating their friends were two

1181
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,263
I'm sure they could get pierogies Trader Joe's or wherever but

1182
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
The who wanted those

1183
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
There wasn't really anyone

1184
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
Making perogies like family

1185
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,247
And we finally said it was one of those ideas where you're like someone Zeppelin

1186
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
Can I do that

1187
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,575
We realize after a while that

1188
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
No one was real that we don't maybe we should

1189
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,951
Maybe they should make pierogies and sell them

1190
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
Guess what this point it was 2015

1191
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
She's grandfather was

1192
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Is no longer alive

1193
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
But

1194
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
He had written all of his recipes out by

1195
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
So they went to the deli

1196
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
And they got them

1197
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
We brought them back to

1198
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
My house

1199
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
And cake

1200
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
My table

1201
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
I hate flower

1202
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,967
And so began the Pierogi making for 10 hours

1203
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Every Sunday

1204
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Vanessa would do

1205
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,343
The dough should be not too thick not too chewy

1206
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
And Casey Wood

1207
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Do the feeling

1208
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,975
It started with three flavors we started with potato and cheese

1209
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
The pineapple and cheese

1210
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,583
And sweet potato caramelized onion

1211
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
I do not believe they grow pineapples in

1212
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
It is very strange

1213
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
Knowing that something you would find back in the old country but

1214
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,079
It actually was one of their grandfather's recipes

1215
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
Anyway every weekend Casey and Vanessa would make the pierogies

1216
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
Freeze them

1217
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,247
And then sell them at the Farmers Market

1218
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
In Melrose Mass

1219
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,599
Chusetts the first farmers market but about 50 boxes

1220
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Sold out in an hour

1221
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,975
And realized that there was a market and one reason they were selling so fast

1222
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
I think dumplings are the ultimate cuff

1223
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,863
Whether it's ravioli art empanadas or it's

1224
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
Asian dumplings

1225
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
It's very nostalgic

1226
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,775
Play all that ye Urban smkc would make and sell pierogi

1227
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
The Weeknd

1228
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
And then go to their office jobs during the week

1229
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
But there was a point where we had to go to the neck

1230
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Except cuz we were just

1231
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
Making only so you know we can only make so much than that

1232
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
That long 10-hour day

1233
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
We couldn't grow unless we

1234
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
So we quit our jobs

1235
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,463
Hand after taking that leap

1236
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
Sisters move their pierogi operation

1237
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,351
From Vanessa's house to a commercial kitchen in Gloucester Mass

1238
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,119
Massachusetts

1239
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
They hired a few

1240
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
People to help

1241
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
Make more pierogies

1242
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
Spud Vanessa

1243
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
She is still doing the dough

1244
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Stretching it out

1245
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
Running it through the dough sheeter

1246
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,151
And then cutting those circles thousands of circle today

1247
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
For the rest of our staff

1248
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
The Felon pain

1249
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:00,319
Vanessa and Casey call their company Joshua perogies Joshua

1250
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,111
Polish word for grandfather

1251
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,951
This month they're about to open their first store Front in Somerville

1252
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
She sits and by the

1253
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,791
End of the summer they're hoping to sign a deal that

1254
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
Would get their Frozen pierogies and some major grocery chains

1255
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
Across the Northeast

1256
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
Pineapple and cheese stuffing

1257
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
They no longer make it

1258
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
Apparently people don't like

1259
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
Pineapple with their teeth

1260
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
But we went to Poland a few years back

1261
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,967
Neither of us are pineapple and ndk

1262
