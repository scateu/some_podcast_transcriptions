41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
And one more thing before we start to show

42
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
If you've ever worked to that communal working space

43
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,080
They're like almost as common as cupcake shops

44
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
These days

45
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
Initially the founders of

46
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Of wework

47
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,784
A really hard time selling that idea to the landlord who rented them their first space

48
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
And now today

49
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
The company has almost

50
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
300 locations worldwide

51
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
How they did it

52
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
Are you will love this story first ran in June of last year

53
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Empty artist

54
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
So they showed it to us

55
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm like wow look for me as coming from a design background like this is sick

56
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Is as good as it gets

57
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,640
And I'm and they're basically okay here's the building what would you do with it

58
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Sobieski I go home

59
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
And

60
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Start thinking of

61
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Concept

62
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Of a name

63
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
I buy the domain

64
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
I build a website

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
I designed some

66
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Floor plans really simple

67
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
Do like a quick like business model I stayed up all night

68
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
You did this in one night

69
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Yeah basically because

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,216
We have been challenged was like what you going to do and we have no credibility right so my thought was

71
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,104
If I do all this stuff and come back tomorrow it'll seem like we were planning it for a weeks in advance right

72
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
From NPR how I built this

73
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
Show about entrepreneurs

74
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
And the stories behind the movements they go

75
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
I'm guy Raz how to friend

76
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
Real estate

77
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,752
7 years build a 17 billion dollar off of sharing company

78
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Help me work

79
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
What's a back in 1985

80
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,088
Someone picked you on an idea to build a chain of stores that

81
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
Just sold copy

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Or saying 2008

83
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
A friend asked you for some seed money to

84
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
To create a service that allows you to rent out a room in your home

85
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
2/8 total stranger

86
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
Orcas in 2010

87
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,056
Someone told you hey you know I want to open up a salon that only blow dries hair no cuts no color

88
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Just blowouts

89
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Thinking you're thinking

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
I would totally jump

91
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
But the reality is in the early days almost

92
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
No one side Starbucks

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
Airbnb or dry bar

94
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
We're going to work

95
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Because who would need that one service right

96
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Some people asked Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey

97
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
When they started to pitch a landlord

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
On the concept of leasing out unused

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Parts of their buildings

100
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
For shared workspaces

101
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
But not just any work

102
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
A membership would include good

103
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Coffee

104
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Foosball tables

105
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Wave lighting

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Decor

107
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Exposed brick

108
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Comfy chairs

109
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
And looks

110
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Aunt

111
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Most importantly

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
A built-in community

113
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
And today that idea they had

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Is called we work

115
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
It has buildings across

116
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303
The US and in more than a dozen countries around the world

117
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
But before that happen

118
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Long before the vision of a

119
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Communal workspace

120
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Even on the Gail mckelvey's radar

121
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
He was actually living in communal life

122
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
Miguel was raised in an all-women

123
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Hippie Collective

124
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
And Eugene Oregon

125
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
There were five women who are all really good

126
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Friends you know best friend

127
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Referral

128
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Bind it all

129
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Pretty much decided to have children without the father's in

130
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Picture I'm just

131
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,463
Because it was a time when they wanted to break free from normal sort of

132
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Arrangements and configurations

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607
And they all depended on each other for everything sort of like

134
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
If we were a family

135
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
The five women and their children some meatballs

136
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
For girls

137
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
And then 10 years later

138
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
My little brother

139
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
Shut up the bass leave those five women

140
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Work ethic

141
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
What are the pants

142
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Insulate like it any of them could

143
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Be in charge

144
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Exactly and we all had

145
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
You know all the holidays together from things

146
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Giving to you start a Christmas like that was our family like

147
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Everyone was

148
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Pretty disconnected from

149
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
You know there are other

150
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
My

151
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
That was you that's why I grew up with and I consider them like

152
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
My mom's my aunts you know whatever you want to call it in my brothers

153
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
Did it feel different when you were a kid or was it

154
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Is it just like that

155
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Eugene Oregon

156
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
What kind of

157
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
There's like a V here

158
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
I mean there was a hippie Vibe amongst the smaller Community there and there was no kids

159
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
Kids with funny names you know like I remember a kid named wind you know and another there was Morning Star and evening star in

160
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
I'm so that made you feel not

161
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
2 weird

162
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,511
I think not until I was older and I realized that there was

163
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
People who kind of had money

164
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
That it became an issue like things that I

165
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Didn't have an effect

166
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
But we always had

167
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,239
Crappy cars that were always breaking down in like billowing big

168
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
How to smoke

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
How to use more like the sort of lie

170
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Being poorer than the lake

171
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Being

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Weird from a family

173
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
You know sort of

174
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
But at the same time

175
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
I wouldn't say I wanted to get out

176
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
But I did from a very young age have

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
A dream of something bigger

178
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
So

179
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
For some reason from the time I was a kid

180
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
When it would be like saying really

181
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Boring summer day

182
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
I would be like you know your what do you want to do

183
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,679
What do you want to do I don't know what I want to go to New York

184
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,007
And for some reason I started saying that when I was a kid and I think it like

185
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
Became more and more of a thing the more I set it in the more it

186
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Became real and it wasn't from lyca

187
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
I hate this place I've got to get out

188
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Recent enough for something bigger

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Wow

190
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
2

191
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
So you grew up in this environment

192
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
And you are one boy among

193
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Lots of women

194
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
Yeah he's always all women pretty much basically

195
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Four Sisters Inn

196
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
+ 5 moms

197
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Yeah

198
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
And I mean looking back on it was weird

199
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
In the sense that like

200
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Like I didn't have

201
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Like I look at it now in terms of like say

202
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
My own Simon

203
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
The role that I played in his life and I realize things that I didn't have

204
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
At all

205
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
You know my mom

206
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,503
Did develops a allow for sports overtime but when I was younger she had no knowledge

207
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
And you love sports

208
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Yeah I mean from a young age

209
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
I did but I didn't have much

210
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
What's guys Encino

211
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
An end which play

212
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Why play basketball

213
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
But never I didn't play it seriously until I was really a nice

214
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
So you know I was like a kid just

215
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Hanging out with

216
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
With a ball but not like I didn't have any

217
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Scales and tails

218
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
And keep an eye exclamation

219
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
You are saying hi to me in the studio you are

220
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
6 foot

221
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
6 ft

222
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,151
Yeah

223
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
I can still dunk I'm proud of that I tried a couple of days ago.

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
What's a good time

225
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Costco David this site

226
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay so Miguel

227
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,183
He wasn't just any basketball player he was actually really good

228
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
He ended up making it

229
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
Team at the University of Oregon

230
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
So he was good

231
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
He wasn't

232
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Diego

233
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
So he focused on his studies

234
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
And got a degree in

235
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
In architecture

236
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
After college Miguel spent a few years trying to build a startup

237
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Pan

238
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
It was a company that helped connect

239
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
In the back of his mind

240
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
You still have this

241
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Dream to live in New York

242
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
Maybe even work as an architect

243
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Shogun 2004

244
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
He started applying for jobs

245
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
So first of all knowing there's something for everyone to learn

246
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
In my experience

247
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
Is that a New York no one's going to reply to you if your

248
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Address on your resume

249
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,679
Is not a New York who cares like who wants to deal with it you know

250
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,055
So I learned that a friend who my friend's brother was living there and he was like

251
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
Like you can use my address and I change my address to his

252
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Russian cream and immediately I got

253
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Want to suggest that one

254
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Switch

255
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
But I got to

256
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Beijing three interviews

257
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
So I'm I flew out

258
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
And

259
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
I think it was a

260
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
A Wednesday

261
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
And

262
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Timeout with one firm they were all

263
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Super like

264
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Shikari

265
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
It's acting like they're all black and like

266
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
Cool glasses in

267
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Superslick office and all that noise like

268
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Dino ID

269
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Fit in there like

270
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Stop for me

271
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
I mean the other one I went to

272
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
Was in dumbo in Brooklyn and it was just

273
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Just two guys in the

274
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Tiny little office

275
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
And they were in jeans and t-shirt

276
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
And you know they had like a really

277
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Relaxed vibe

278
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,063
And you know I talked to him and basically this guy Jordan parnass who

279
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Was the owner of the farm he was like

280
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Okay great

281
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
We like you we need you were really busy can you start tomorrow

282
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And I'm like

283
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Cuz I said I lived in New York right

284
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
So literally I'm nothing with me I'm like well

285
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Can I have a week

286
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
You know cuz I was trying to make up a lie on the spot it like why can't I stop

287
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Tomorrowland

288
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
We negotiated musically let me start Monday instead of

289
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
Thursday so at least I went back to Portland I literally packed up my entire apartment

290
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
I called my mom and

291
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Like Mom

292
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
Take all my stuff you know she packed it up and put it in her back of her car

293
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,951
And I moved to New York with a duffel bag on Sunday night I remember I landed and

294
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
And

295
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Never look back

296
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
And you are young but you weren't like

297
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Us30 size old

298
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Another word for like

299
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Somebody started

300
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Trai

301
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
And the job was $10 an hour

302
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
So I mean I was in was like I'd Money in the Bank

303
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
They needed a

304
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Certified for

305
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Professional architect

306
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,975
Well I wasn't a certified professional architect right I was a junior level draftsman

307
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Like I was the lowest on the totem pole that's what they were

308
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
I want to do one of the person they could pay little

309
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
Who do odds and ends jobs

310
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Taking that risk it all

311
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
No because I think one it was

312
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
I get to move to New York

313
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Which was the big

314
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Your goal in that was

315
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Do you know getting my

316
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Foot in the door but

317
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
2

318
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
What did I have to lose

319
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
You know I mean I didn't

320
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
It's like I didn't have anything to my name

321
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
I didn't have any money I would

322
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
There's nowhere I could there's no way I was going down

323
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
The worst case scenario move back to my mom's house in Eugene for a while

324
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Stuff out and what was it

325
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,095
So what happened there which was really cool is that

326
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
The Jordan parnassa grown up

327
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
With the attorney in March

328
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
So Dove is American Apparel

329
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Founder

330
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Exactly

331
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
So originally when I

332
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
First went there the project that they had was an American Apparel

333
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
And it was in lower Manhattan there was one that already done and then they're working on

334
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
You need to design a torta like

335
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
Yeah design it and managed the construction end and build-out

336
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,071
Yeah it was but also American Apparel this was their first reach out right so they were a wholesale company and they were just

337
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Flooring could they do reach

338
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,471
And so it was great timing because one

339
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
Getting there at that time when American Apparel was just starting out was great but

340
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,943
To my background being in business actually was applicable to this new idea

341
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Retail row map

342
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,087
And so what ended up happening was over the course of you starting out in more project manager

343
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Control is like okay now we have to America

344
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
American Apparel

345
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Now we have three now we have four now we have five

346
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
It turned from that which was actually managing

347
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
A project

348
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,887
2 now we've got in the office we have 10

349
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,751
Now we're doing 20 now we have 40 concurrent project how how fast

350
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
Explosive there growth what is firm in 2004 and like

351
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Within just a few years

352
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
She's like 30 40 50

353
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
200 after 4 years or so

354
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
So mean

355
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
You got to this firm at just the right time

356
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Like land of this really

357
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Candyland

358
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Clearly that

359
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Exchange your life

360
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
Yeah I definitely had the attitude that

361
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
This feeling that

362
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
Every potential thing that's going to come up is something I'm going to use it

363
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
And so

364
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
American Apparel

365
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Project Veritas

366
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
We're under like really tight time

367
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Timeframes and Doug was like

368
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Really intense

369
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
And you know there was times I remember a day

370
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Black Friday is on

371
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Obviously the Friday after that

372
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
Thanksgiving I remember him calling me and saying like

373
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
We have to have the store open there's a problem in Denver

374
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
We're not open I'm going to kill you

375
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
Something to that effect and he was like this is the most important

376
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
This is the most important moment of your life right now

377
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
You have to get on a plane

378
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
Right now to Denver and make sure the store opens

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
But it was like once you've been through that it's sort of like well

380
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
What's going to come up that will be worse what's more intense and having the

381
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
Person scream at you at the top of their lungs in until

382
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Respond to it in like a positive way and say I'm going to take this

383
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
6 grand to know that I can

384
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
And learn from it and do something

385
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
So when you are

386
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
The Firm

387
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Did you

388
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,887
Start my own firm

389
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Start my own business

390
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
I can't keep doing this for a long time

391
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
So there was definitely an expiration for me in terms of

392
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
I think really

393
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
The learning curve when the learning curve expires

394
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
That's when I start looking for other

395
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
I think so

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
I think once we've done a whole bunch of American Apparel Project tonight

397
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
I've seen it before

398
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
I started thinking what what else am I going to do

399
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
And this is

400
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Kind of starts the wework story is that

401
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
Why was working for the firm at a co-worker

402
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Israeli guy named Gil

403
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
And I became friendly with him and we

404
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
You know where

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
Sexy I Was An Architect working on American Apparel projects in

406
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
We became friendly and I remember you know he invited me over to his

407
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Apartment one weekend and

408
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
I went over there and

409
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
As we're walking into the building

410
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
I think in walks this other

411
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Dude

412
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
And we get introduced in

413
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Just Adam

414
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
It's a hot summer day in the US

415
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
We work

416
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Adam Newman and he's got his

417
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Shirt off I think which

418
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Just to walk into a New York

419
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
You know Condo building rental building elevator with no shirt is one kind of statement

420
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
And then to

421
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
I remember ads were like

422
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
You know going up in the elevator

423
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
He's starting conversations with people who are on the elevator and then he's like holding the door as the person get off and then continuing the car

424
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,087
And I don't know Israelis at all so first of all I'm coming from Oregon I've never met an Israeli

425
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
Before so I don't even know this sort of abrasiveness

426
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
But I've come to love

427
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
But there's that and then there's Adam Hoosier

428
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Just has like a really

429
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
You know

430
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Exuberant sort of personality

431
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Which is the guy who lived in the building

432
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
So he was girl's roommate

433
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,519
So what I didn't know that at the time though because I mean

434
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
I didn't understand like it wasn't like I've been pre introduced a new this

435
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
Situation or what I was coming into but sort of on that elevator ride it

436
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
It was all a

437
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Explain to me along the way

438
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
So you and Adam just like hit it off right then and there

439
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,415
Yeah that sounds weird cuz it doesn't really make sense to me aside from the fact that we're both tall

440
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
We don't have that much in common

441
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
I mean we're totally

442
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
People for whatever reason we just connected we just

443
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
There was something between us that just sort of made sense

444
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
I'm so he had a couple of startups

445
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
One of them both of them I think we're baby clothing

446
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Japanese and

447
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
He had sort of an idea for

448
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
Innovating a baby clothing by putting on knee pads

449
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
In baby's pants

450
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Straight to protect

451
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
I'm with their called Crawlers

452
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Did he have a baby at the

453
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
No no baby

454
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
I don't understand where the whole baby thing come from we have to

455
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Ask him to remember but

456
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Tell he was interested in succeeding in business

457
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
And he thought that was a good idea and until he was pursuing it

458
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
And that's actually the way we became closer friends was

459
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,495
He was looking for a new office for his baby clothing company

460
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
And he was looking at spaces in Manhattan and I was like look

461
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
You're going to get double spaced

462
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
For half the price

463
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
In dumbo what you know in my building where I am

464
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
In Brooklyn so

465
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
I may convince them to him to move there

466
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
So then he was just down the hall from you where I was working at that

467
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
I'm at The Firm on the America

468
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
NFL projects

469
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Did you find

470
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Kind of charisma

471
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
An atom that you

472
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
You felt you didn't

473
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
Yeah I think so I mean it's more like

474
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
Yeah it's a Christmas a good word for it it's also more of

475
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
A brashness which I think is

476
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
Is cool but which I don't

477
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Like I can't

478
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
You don't like to be the center of

479
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Well I like to be next to the center of a

480
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,199
That's the thing is that like I like the idea but I just don't want to be

481
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
But I really enjoy the energy

482
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
That sort of comes from that like I like that like seeing it

483
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
So what happened to he one day come up to and say

484
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
I have an idea and I want to do with you is a

485
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Seamless or is it a little more complicated

486
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
So it's hard to say exactly

487
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,239
That moment like it's hard to remember but but yeah something to the effect of we're talkin about this building that were in

488
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
And we're looking at

489
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
The

490
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
Relationship between all of these tenants cool comfy

491
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,479
And then the level of service that they're getting from the landlord

492
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
And he had seen sort of the business model before I've liked office

493
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
Which I wasn't familiar with but he was like

494
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
I think if we make

495
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,023
You know these office suites we can we can make money we can make more money than the landlord

496
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Currently charging

497
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Hippie spice idea was to

498
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Scream like a bunch of shared

499
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Offices in cubicles invented

500
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
When can I

501
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
Exactly so I mean not nothing too complicated other than just like

502
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
Hey right now they lease you an empty space

503
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
With

504
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
You know 2000 square feet

505
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Piedmont minimum

506
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
And you basically has a small business you have it in your own hands to figure that out

507
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
You know you have to

508
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
Build it out you got to buy all your own Furniture you got to

509
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,743
Sublease space if you can't fill it all up like you're facing all those challenges

510
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,375
And you're paying a good price with the time was you know 20 bucks a square foot or whatever would she knows a good deal

511
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
But it was just a very low level of

512
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Service since I think

513
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
He

514
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Brought to me that idea

515
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
I was like

516
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
I'm sounds great

517
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
The challenge was that neither of us really had a

518
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
Variance in real estate or anything

519
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
And so

520
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
He would go to the owners of

521
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
This building

522
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
DJ

523
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Entei

524
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Hey

525
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
We see there

526
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
Floors that are available here will you lease Michael Jackson

527
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,327
Well so they were like redeveloping the building over time they were kind of going floor-by-floor and trying to like

528
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
You know move people around 2 because they wanted to make my rent so they're kind of like

529
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Improving cuz it was really crap

530
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Bad shape

531
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
So they were trying to say they had enough

532
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Thought to say hey let's read about this

533
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Charge my money

534
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:34,015
And so I'm he started going to everything Lisa Soho floor and at the time I don't remember a floor plate there but it might have been you know 10.

535
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
1000 square feet

536
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
1450

537
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Square feet

538
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
America's Line

539
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Who are you

540
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
You're like the baby clothing guy who

541
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
We can't even pay your rent on time

542
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah

543
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:48,095
Why would we rent to you it makes no sense that you don't know anything about it like we're the experts we owned 100 buildings

544
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,447
I may just kept saying no but credit to Adam in this

545
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
As part of his

546
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
You know

547
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Innate ability to like

548
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
Continue to press even when people say no

549
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,151
He just kept going back and back and no nose every week for probably

550
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,759
I like the two of you sat down together to let Incorporated

551
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
You're saying he was trying to do this

552
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Yeah we had no business plan we are not

553
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
It was a very simple idea of like

554
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Hey could we break up

555
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Space inside

556
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
No real

557
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Plan it was just an

558
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Simple prints

559
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
The owner of the building

560
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
So he's saying no no no no

561
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,751
For weeks on end and then one day apparently and I wasn't there at the time but he says

562
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
We are not going to give you a floor in

563
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
But I have this other building across the

564
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
I've been clearing out

565
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
You'll come take a look

566
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Hey let's go look at this building

567
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
And it's

568
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Beautiful

569
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
It's like perfect

570
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Do you know Brooklyn

571
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Warehouse building

572
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Exposed brick

573
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
Timber no beams and columns big Windows views of the water

574
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
You literally like

575
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
You know ideal

576
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Building 4

577
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
The cool like

578
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
No startup Brooklyn vibe

579
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,703
And I'm and they're basically okay here's the building what would you do with it

580
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
And

581
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
I'm like

582
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
What are we going to do

583
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Adam's like I don't know I'm like okay I'll figure it out

584
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Sobieski I go home

585
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
And

586
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Start thinking of

587
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
A concept

588
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Of a name

589
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Come up with green desk

590
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Which is

591
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Owosso Speedway

592
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Oriented towards

593
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
People who are environmentally responsible

594
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
I buy the domain

595
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
You know I build a website

596
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
I designed some

597
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,912
Floor plans really simple you like a quick like business model

598
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Big Sky we remember I went

599
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Kinkos in pack business cards made passing Little

600
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
National fires

601
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
Please put I stayed up all night

602
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
You did this in one night

603
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Yeah basically because

604
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,296
We have been challenged with like what are you going to do when we have no credibility right so my thought was

605
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
If I do all this stuff and come back to

606
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,440
Tomorrow it'll seem like we we we were planning it for a weeks in advance

607
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
That's right

608
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Only show up the next day with this

609
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
This whole thing and they're like

610
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Kind of Blown Away like

611
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Oh like

612
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376

613
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,472
Have company you actually have something real here and that was really you know

614
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Of course Adam

615
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Sold

616
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080

No money

619
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
We have nothing

620
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
A moment to Adam and Miguel went

621
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600

664

Hey welcome back to how I built this from

665
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
NPR

666
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Gyros

667
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
So it's 2008

668
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,608
And miquelon Adam convince a Brooklyn landlord to give them one floor in a building

669
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
To start a company

670
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
And the idea is to create this really

671
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Cool looking space wear

672
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
People can rent out opposite

673
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
In the company of this point is called Green.

674
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Even before they finished

675
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Preparing the space

676
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
They started to advertise

677
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
I remember the day when we first did it we

678
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,344
We put masking tape down on the floor to sort of show the layout of the works

679
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,696
And on we posted ads on Craigslist and people started calling

680
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,048
You know my cell phone and I would meet them into him to the building with just masking tape on

681
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
When people started signing up from just the master

682
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
That just showed how different it was one cuz it was cool

683
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,312
We had a list of all the things we're going to offer you never going to give you coffee we're going to cool events

684
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
This kind of stuff

685
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,200
And people needed that you would get

686
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Permanent workspace

687
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
That would be yours or

688
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,856
Or what yeah so the the thing that was happening back then was there was

689
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
Their existing

690
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Charter corporate office

691
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
And then there was coworker

692
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
What's the time

693
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Co-working is primarily Tech

694
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Focused it's a lot of like

695
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
You know engineers in a big open room

696
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Headphones on your computer

697
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
And there was

698
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
Some of those wasn't like prevalent but you know there's some in Sanford

699
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Just go if you in New York

700
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
And they were primarily like oriented towards a group of people who kind of all knew each other and then they're going to come together

701
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
There and then they all want to work together in

702
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
In the same room in the nearby Smothers

703
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,136
Adam and I didn't come from that all we were in this Brooklyn environment we weren't from Tech

704
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,232
And we were much more interested in this like diversity and all these

705
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,560
Cool different kinds of companies and what that energy is when they come to

706
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
That said

707
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
All those businesses are doing like

708
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
Real sales around the phone they're having meetings are talking to

709
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,544
So this idea of like a big open room just didn't work for us

710
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
It didn't make sense so I think when we first started it was more like

711
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
We're going to do small offices you could have like a small

712
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
Yeah 5 foot by 7 foot one person office

713
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
A two-person four-person

714
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,136
Person a person I think at the time maybe at 12 was the largest we did

715
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
And that was you know all glass parts

716
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
Distance are very open and Airy

717
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
And it was really like

718
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
You know hey

719
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Join

720
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,912
A group of people working together but you're still in your own private

721
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
I think at the time we were probably starting at like

722
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,568
$300 for like the lowest end and you know whenever

723
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,640
Up to 50000 for a 4-person office ballpark

724
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,040
Was it expensive when you look at the overall net cost but also not cheap it wasn't like hey this is rock bottom prices

725
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
This is like

726
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
2008

727
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
White before the financial crash

728
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Yeah

729
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
You know that I think

730
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
Positive and negative in the sense that

731
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,400
One the world was changing very quickly and there was people who are thinking about things differently you know

732
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
Perhaps like working at Lehman Brothers or whatever is not

733
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
You know the

734
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
The best thing for your life where is

735
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
You could have been before

736
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
You either have some numbers like that or like how I used to be

737
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
For this company and now I want to do it on my own

738
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
So how many people did you sign up for that

739
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
First base

740
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
So I mean I think

741
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Explore in that building was

742
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
A little under maybe I was 70.

743
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
People are so

744
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
So we had five floors

745
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,048
So I think that building was about 350 members

746
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
You know it filled up very fast and then we

747
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
Expanded back to 68j which was

748
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
Does the cool thing cuz we went back to the building they wouldn't let us have in the first place

749
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
And started building out more

750
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Tempaper basic

751
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
You became the Arkansas

752
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
Yasso Gill was also our partner at the time so there were three of us and we work together again you know

753
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
Worked on who else

754
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
Help with that

755
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
And then I bet he was still working at American Apparel or with

756
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
The Firm that did that and then out of the store

757
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
The baby clothing company

758
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Stylust beats to the operator

759
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
So I did

760
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
All the stuff to get the business going

761
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
And I really was

762
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
You know there

763
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Whatever

764
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,496
18 hours a day putting the whole thing together and

765
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
I really running it

766
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
You know

767
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
As a very small business

768
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
So did you guys start to make money at this light

769
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Very quickly

770
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
Yeah so the challenge there was

771
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
It was a good business definitely right off the bat

772
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
And we were profitable

773
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
But the problem is is that its capital intense

774
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,768
So we did the first building under R 50/50

775
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Agreement

776
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
And we started thinking big we're like this

777
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Amazing everyone loves it

778
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Going to grow

779
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
And we started looking at Manhattan looking at

780
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
Cisco thinking of other locations

781
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
But they had a portfolio that they already own

782
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
I'm the owner of the building

783
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
So is in their interest to use all the real estate in their own parts

784
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
So they're showing us

785
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Brooklyn

786
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
We're thinking about building a big brand and thinking this is like a worldwide phenomenon like we're going to change the world or doing something really cool

787
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
And they're thinking let's fill up a large

788
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Custom buildings that have big

789
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,280
Then so as soon as we started talking about like

790
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
Other bigger things

791
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
It just showed this is not a partnership this

792
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
Going to work long-term so you laugh

793
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
Zoe Saldana

794
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
So he sold to them

795
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
They got a great business

796
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
Is there still operating

797
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,104
And we got some money to start over again so they own green

798
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,712
Leon green. Stay still operated and it's a nice little business what did you guys walk away

799
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
I wish I remember the details but I'm moving must have gotten like

800
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,368
Somewhere between half a million a million dollars each

801
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,720
I mean it was a good amount of money and I think it also presented

802
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
A challenge

803
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
In that

804
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
We had to ask ourselves like

805
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Do we

806
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Take this money and put it in the bank

807
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,960
Or do we view no sort of go forward and invested in the neck

808
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Next thing I think

809
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Bradham and I was

810
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Clear like we're on the Sun

811
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Something big here in

812
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Let's roll with it and keep going

813
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Anything for Gilly was a little bit different like you saw this money in

814
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,552
I was like hey I can move back to Israel and I've got a bunch of money in the bank and pay my life

815
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
I needed that so

816
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
No that was good for him in a good

817
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
Result for Adam and I was enough to say okay let's switch

818
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,560
Focus completely to this business

819
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
India to create a new name a new brand all the stuff

820
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,960
Yeah so I think one of things that we learned that green dots that was super important was

821
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
When the wind was really working what were

822
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
What school was the connection between people and

823
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
The things that you would hear

824
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
People say to each other in support of each other even though they're in

825
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Completely different

826
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Just eat a late at night there's

827
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,672
Across the hall people having these really cool conversations about life about business and then there's also

828
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Accountability

829
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Because one of the things about

830
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Being a small business especially on

831
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,328
On your own or if your owner of a small company it's like

832
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
No one's watching you to see if you

833
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
You show up in the more I try

834
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
But one of the coolest things that happens is like

835
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,080
How people become accountable to each other even though they're not working for the same company so if you don't show up for a couple days

836
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,384
Someone actually asked you like hey where you been

837
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
So that's one of the cool things that happened

838
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
It's a sort of like

839
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
Play we're all working together even though we're separate

840
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
You know

841
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Okay so obviously this point

842
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
You could not be greenedesk

843
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Marceau

844
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
How did you start to come up with a new name

845
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
So

846
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:01,120
Problem that we had in trying to reinvent the business is like what do you call that you know what is the name for

847
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
A community oriented business

848
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
You know without it sounding too like

849
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Hippy dippy

850
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,848
Like how do you come up with something to suggest the idea that we're all together and that we want to like

851
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,944
Be open and connected to each other but doesn't have these words in it that

852
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Sort of sound

853
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
2

854
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
Like over the top in terms of you know

855
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Hey let's all hold hands

856
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
We work

857
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
Yeah and I think it took a while to get there

858
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
What actually happened I think

859
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,096
Literally in the middle of the night Adams friend Andrew just

860
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,888
Literally came out with it and he said

861
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,216
It's wework it's we live it's we sleep that we eat at sweet

862
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Like just flowed with this whole thing

863
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
And was a dialogue between

864
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
Months old that just

865
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
Happened in a moment for him

866
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
In the building haidian soon as we heard it

867
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
So where was your first stop where is

868
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Did you go to find a

869
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Your first place

870
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
So we looked

871
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
In Manhattan a lot

872
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
You did have a non-compete

873
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
With our green desperate

874
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,768
They're so we have limited number of areas week

875
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
We could go so we're looking in San Francisco and also a minute

876
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
And

877
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,472
It was tough and we had a lot of conversations with people who were like again who are you

878
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
You have no background in real estate

879
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,360
And also people looking for a big credit tenants I mean specially in that environment of

880
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Of the

881
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
Financial crisis a lot of landlords have been burned even by credit tenant to you know broke their lease and

882
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Went bankrupt or whatever

883
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,672
So very few people wanted to work with us and we looked at a tuna spaces in

884
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Everyone just said

885
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
Why you know who are you

886
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
And so

887
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Really what happened to me

888
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
It was a friend of a friend of a friend

889
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Knew somebody in

890
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
And somehow

891
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
I'm connected

892
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
For this building I'm in SoHo

893
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
And

894
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
It was really a relationship sale

895
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
You know Adam again like

896
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
Redis persistence

897
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,248
And he was willing to go over and over and over to the owner and just

898
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Convince him that

899
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
We were the right tenant for the

900
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Does building

901
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
And and he know he he's good at making connections with people once that door is open like if he sees a crack in the

902
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,584
We can get in there then he's never going to stop until did you put the money

903
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Did you guys have the money

904
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
Yes we had the money from the green.

905
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
Celso which was enough for the

906
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
Security deposit and you know it

907
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
So it's not like

908
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
This landlord has a

909
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
Carnival drops right here not like

910
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Oh there's all kinds of companies

911
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
Clamoring to move in

912
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
Swing like a good place from a real estate perspective

913
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Because we will take your whole building

914
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
And there's not that many other

915
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
What is the building look like

916
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Ready to just

917
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Rent out

918
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
The people or did you have to cut it and

919
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Like

920
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
Not at all ready

921
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
Full. It was actually

922
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,656
In terrible condition so

923
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Did it was it going to be

924
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
Required to renovate that build

925
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
Probably in the order of a few million dollars

926
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Cuz because

927
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
You had a vision of what you wanted to be right like

928
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Imagining life

929
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
You know

930
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Hardwood floors

931
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Distressed wood

932
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Wood floors and

933
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Beautiful

934
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Appliances and

935
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,976
I mean yeah so we were more conservative back then in terms of our investment you know

936
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
We did a lot of the work herself and mutilate the actual labor

937
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
Yeah there was a limit to how much they would build versus us until we had some responsibility one of our responsibilities was it wiring

938
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
All the cabling

939
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
And so that we were out there getting bids for it wiring and remember we got

940
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,408
One for $100,000 and one for like 87,000

941
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
Hundred I remember getting those estimates to mean like

942
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
$100,000 is a pretty round number for

943
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Wiring like

944
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Cheniere like a more detailed calculation of how much that cost

945
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,952
So my little brother and I he's

946
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
Background in he was pretty mad and he's like kind of research scientist in his brain

947
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,376
And he had moved out to help us it was me Kyle and Adam at the time

948
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
And I'm like hey why don't we look into how this actually works in the way his brain works has been to break it down into like them

949
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Micro Parts Peekskill

950
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,128
Every cable run how long is it

951
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
How many terminations you know how do you do termination

952
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
Then I mean I remember he asked me to

953
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Going to cost us

954
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:07,392
$8,000 in materials and then you know whatever like 50 hours of Labor whatever the number was it was some

955
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
Crazy small number relative to this hundred.

956
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
And so are they

957
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Well

958
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
It's not rocket science so we can do that are so

959
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
So we just did it ourselves

960
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
You wired

961
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
The building yourselves

962
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
Yeah you would like laying the wire dog

963
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,288
And all of it so we had to get like a hammer drill and like

964
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,360
I drill into the brick to hold like brackets to hold the wire we had to

965
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
I mean I was so much fun it was like it was crazy but it was also like we're really fully engage and we had to teach ourselves how to

966
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,624
The connect patch panels and program switches and you know so we put in that whole infrastructure

967
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
I remember one of the things we had to do was actually

968
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
This thing called soda blasting which is

969
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
If you want that cool like

970
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,888
Exposed brick has been painted you have to blast the the

971
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,216
This thing called soda blasting where you use baking soda to do that

972
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
And we have to buy

973
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,640
Baking soda by like the 50 lb bag and you need bags and bags and bag of the sermon we would like rent Zipcars

974
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
Play some New Jersey load up

975
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
The car would like to

976
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,880
Baking soda and we put so much in there that it would be like riding on the wheels on the tires so we would like driving back from New Jersey to the tunneling UPS

977
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
As the tires like

978
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Running on the back of the

979
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
The wheel

980
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
But that was what we were doing was like every step

981
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Was like we're going to

982
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
And we rented the equipment

983
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,168
The soda blasting equipment just to like do it herself at a compressor

984
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
On the streets of Manhattan just sitting out there like

985
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Just like

986
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
The compressor is running out there in like

987
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
There's all this baking soda billowing out of the windows upstairs it was awesome

988
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
2 minute timer

989
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
So you sign the lease to when you

990
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Open the first floor how long was it

991
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
A few months or 3 months probably a maybe a little less look pretty quick

992
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
Take me into that first floor that you

993
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
You opened up

994
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
Yeah so when you walk in you basically have you know an old wood floor which we refinished and had a lot of that cool character hundred

995
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Your old work

996
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Before you have it

997
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Exposed brick

998
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
It's going to be soda blasted

999
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Disorder bring back to that

1000
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,288
Rustic sort of vibe we had iron columns that were

1001
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,384
We're cool in High character and then what we sort of inserted into that was sort of a Sharp

1002
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
Modern in a glass and aluminum system

1003
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
Do you have this Play Between the old and the new

1004
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,648
And another thing was like from the very beginning I didn't want to have an office evod that all again the seams

1005
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,464
Not like a big deal now but back then we did

1006
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
Batman 2010

1007
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,096
How quickly things change I mean back then we did all

1008
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Incandescent lighting

1009
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:31,776
To do that in a workspace at the time it just didn't exist you had like a cool Brooklyn restaurant in Old auto garage

1010
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
You had you know other people say doing booty

1011
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
Cheap hotels with that buy but in workspace no one did that at all

1012
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
So it's totally unique there was nothing like it

1013
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
How many

1014
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
People joined up by the day you open

1015
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
I think when we first open the first

1016
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
Floor we are probably in the 70 to 80

1017
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Percent range

1018
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,256
And then within the first couple of months the first two floors were were pretty much full

1019
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
So once this building

1020
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
Like most people started to join up in this thing

1021
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Start a tablet

1022
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Takeoff

1023
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Was Eydie immediately to go out

1024
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
And get investors and

1025
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Like scale is make this

1026
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Huge

1027
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Okay so

1028
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Part of the story which we didn't talk about it

1029
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,152
Before we even built the first location

1030
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Are we actually

1031
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
Had an encounter with a potential investor who

1032
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,600
In a room for one of these potential real estate

1033
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,440
Also we are pitching a building we really wanted to get the school building down at Canal Street

1034
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
And the owner of it was like

1035
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,328
You know I'm not sure if I'll give you the building but I got this friend who might be interested

1036
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
He's going to come over so this guy shows up to the meeting

1037
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Sit down doesn't release

1038
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
These are like

1039
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
Orthodox Jewish guys

1040
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,360
During the black suit and stuff so it to me still has an Oregonian a little bit

1041
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,712
I don't really know the world too well but Adam felt really comfortable with it by then

1042
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
But he ends up calling I think the

1043
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,088
That later that day or the next day after the meeting and saying hey

1044
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
I don't think we're going to get that building but I want a partner

1045
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,024
With you guys and we're like well we don't really need a partner we got money we're going to

1046
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Building your own thing here

1047
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
Is it yeah but I what will it take

1048
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
You know whatever it takes I want to

1049
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
And so yeah we were like

1050
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,032
Why not let's throw out a number

1051
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
And

1052
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
We'll make it outrageous

1053
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
Is no chance I'll say yes but if he does then he were fighting like we did pretty well

1054
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:20,576
And we had no building we had no signed lease even and we propose the 45 million dollar valuation

1055
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
And

1056
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
That's pretty high for

1057
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Sephora business.

1058
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
Is unproven in

1059
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
And until you said yes

1060
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
And I said okay I want to be a third partner

1061
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Antelope

1062
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
I'm coming to that

1063
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
Which I think at the time was a little bit

1064
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:43,616
Scary but at the same time it's like wow that's a real empowerment to say okay now we're going to have all this cash gave you all this cash

1065
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Shoe dress

1066
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
So you didn't give us

1067
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
But he committed to it

1068
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
He gave us some of the

1069
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
A little bit to start and then a little bit more of a

1070
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
That's actually

1071
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
A really great story in the sense that

1072
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,024
He empowered us to think really big because we started out with this

1073
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
About this

1074
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
Valuation that sort of validated

1075
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
Our picture of the future which was really big

1076
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
So it was great and we're still good friends with him and everything is

1077
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Is awesome but

1078
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
That was the first step in the first money that we took isn't

1079
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
And then of course overtime you got more more investment

1080
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
You

1081
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
Expanded you build more and more these faces

1082
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Yeah and I think what we did

1083
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Was

1084
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
We built fast

1085
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
We built inexpensively

1086
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
And we turned around deals really quick

1087
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
And we were successful

1088
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,024
You know we built up credibility because each location that we did

1089
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,840
Worked and we did what we said we're going to do

1090
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
You know we weren't like saved

1091
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
A tech startup where it's like oh there's some

1092
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
You know hockey stick

1093
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Growth and all of a sudden we're going to have

1094
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
Millions of users or whatever

1095
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
But we were really clear that we're going to

1096
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
You know continue to grow

1097
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,528
And the vibe in the building's was unique and it was super cool and when people came in they could tell it was something different

1098
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Just on walking in the door would be like

1099
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Like wow this is something I haven't

1100
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,696
And that validation of both

1101
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
You know the business is successful it really works

1102
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,816
Fundamentals of the business are really good

1103
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
And then we're like

1104
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,984
You know we're cool guys and we have a good story and we're here at the right time and you know those things all added up

1105
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Yeah you know I mean

1106
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
I wonder

1107
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
And you must look at

1108
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Simmons company

1109
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Uber ride

1110
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Big Tex

1111
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
Andy is coming we think of his

1112
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Giants Ridge

1113
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,064
And you always have people to show people who started companies that

1114
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Don't exist

1115
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Like like humpback

1116
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
And that was a fastest company in history

1117
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
A billion dollars in Revenue

1118
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
It doesn't exist

1119
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,816
Read anything about it

1120
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
Your company now

1121
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
This is valuable

1122
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
June 17th

1123
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Counting dollars

1124
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
And it seems like you could be there forever but

1125
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
I mean do you ever think that

1126
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Do you know all this

1127
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
Collapse one day and

1128
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
And not be there

1129
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
You know it's a

1130
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Great question

1131
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
One of the things that we're holding onto

1132
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Bratayley

1133
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
Is the feeling that we're still figuring it out

1134
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,415
That nothing we've done so far is the right answer

1135
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
You still feeling

1136
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
100%

1137
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
Set up at the values irrelevant right to the business problem

1138
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,375
Like who cares how much money your worth when you're facing

1139
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
A business problem that is

1140
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Is always evolving and that

1141
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Your primary interest

1142
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Does in solving it in a better way it's or primary

1143
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
Reason for existing is trying to help other people sick

1144
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,663
So our problem is like

1145
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
If they change WeChat

1146
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
And it's sort of symbiotic

1147
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
And that's why I think we don't really have a

1148
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,855
The Finish Line it's not like a we're going to figure out some model

1149
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,951
And then we roll it out across the globe it doesn't work that way for us at also

1150
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
That challenge will never stop

1151
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,327
Will have the learning curve forever which is what makes it awesome and Adam and I

1152
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
When we talk about this

1153
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
Is 100 year old child

1154
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
It's not like he were building companies we can sell it and move on

1155
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
We're doing this cuz we think this is the most

1156
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Interesting

1157
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
Biggest challenge we can work on it until it's just

1158
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
Keep on it forever

1159
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
When you did your last round of Finance

1160
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
The company was valued at 6

1161
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
16

1162
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
Billion dollars

1163
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Tell me that you started

1164
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
In 2010

1165
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Which

1166
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Is

1167
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,095
I see I mean do you ever did you ever give her stop and think

1168
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Patches

1169
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Knots

1170
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
That's a good question I don't

1171
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
It's interesting to think about the times at which

1172
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
These things hate you

1173
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
And

1174
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,663
I would say I'll remember calling my friends when

1175
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
We were first reaching

1176
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Billion dollar buyer

1177
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
I can remember dinner with one of my best friends

1178
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
When we were at 130

1179
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
And he was like

1180
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
Oh my God 130 like

1181
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,439
Are you going to selling retired and I was

1182
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Like what

1183
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Like why would I do that like I'm just

1184
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
This is so much fun you know no chance

1185
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
We got you a billion I remember

1186
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,471
Feeling pretty bashful about even saying the words like I remember almost feeling like

1187
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,359
Like wow I don't want to send this in a text message cuz going to sound so Preposterous like I want to call and only say it verbally

1188
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,407
But then you know once

1189
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,759
You cross that threshold it sort of like the other ones going from there and

1190
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
First of all I wouldn't complain about the fact that you

1191
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
Used to live in Manhattan and I live in nice

1192
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
And I'm living

1193
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,695
You know I moved to an apartment with an awesome View and not so

1194
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Childhood dream to Lexi the New York

1195
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
City skylines

1196
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
Those threshold where I live a great life

1197
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
That's awesome

1198
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
But beyond that I don't have like some big MB

1199
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
It's not really interesting to me it's more

1200
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,543
Again like to be on a path where I feel like I get

1201
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Continue to engage in

1202
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Something that's what

1203
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
It's really you think about like

1204
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
These

1205
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
Huge boom

1206
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:36,991
Gold

1207
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Or oil

1208
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Ortega

1209
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,599
And the company's really

1210
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
We're sustainable the company that made money

1211
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
The most money off of these ends

1212
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
Tree Service

1213
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
Levi's jeans

1214
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
Surface the gold rush

1215
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
And

1216
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,863
Is company to service the oil

1217
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Riggs or

1218
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
You know the

1219
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
Become visible LaPlace

1220
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
You guys are

1221
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Kind of doing the same thing I mean there's a

1222
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Just had boom

1223
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
And a boom of

1224
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Amazon Chopra noodle spirit

1225
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
And you

1226
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
Kind of said what what services

1227
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Let's provide the service

1228
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
Yeah that's a great way of looking at it I don't think I've heard it

1229
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,903
It stated that way but I think it's really true and it's not just

1230
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
Those things which any Tech boom is important

1231
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:23,327
But it's also a shift in what people are looking for in their life and what their expectations are from work

1232
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Because

1233
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
There's a

1234
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
Major shift happening in terms of

1235
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,239
Young people thinking about going to work everyday

1236
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
And what do they want back

1237
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,687
People don't want to punch the clock anymore and then have their life start when they leave the office they want their life

1238
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
To be integrate

1239
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
They want to feel like there

1240
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,551
There's value in what they do everyday

1241
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
And that's part of the environment that we create you know you can get that so you working at Google Facebook whatever super cool office you know maybe

1242
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Do you feel this vibe

1243
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:56,351
But when you're a small company or so you're working for a bank or one of these places that isn't inherently as

1244
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
School you may not get that

1245
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
Azizi and what we're offering is something we're

1246
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,007
You're an independent worker or you're a small company of

1247
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Two people

1248
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Warrior like

1249
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
A division from a pharmaceutical company or a bank

1250
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,199
We're giving you that super cool environment where like it doesn't feel like

1251
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,759
You're going to work everyday it feels like you're going to

1252
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
You know a cool spot to like meet people and connect and collaborate right and that's I think the trend that we're working alongside

1253
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
Lexus

1254
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,023
Specifically attack or less so than any other business permits more like a mindset

1255
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
Yeah it is very interesting seeing you

1256
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Talk about this

1257
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
With confidence in a

1258
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Barry

1259
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Shut up

1260
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Queer

1261
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Way and you

1262
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
And I'm also seeing you as this

1263
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Kid in the

1264
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Is communism

1265
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
In Oregon

1266
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
And I'm trying to square that Circle

1267
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
It's it's just

1268
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
It seems so implausible

1269
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
That

1270
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
You know

1271
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Here you are, real estate deals

1272
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
The price for square foot and

1273
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
All this

1274
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,743
And I'm not that is a bad thing

1275
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
Rare it's just

1276
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Right I mean do you ever

1277
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
I think that's

1278
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
Just impossible

1279
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
No primarily because

1280
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
I've been doing all the hard work for the last

1281
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
I mean literally

1282
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
From 1990

1283
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,431
Sex or whenever it was

1284
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
95 when I started architecture

1285
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,527
Pasquale and I committed to the work

1286
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Like

1287
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
I work non-stop since

1288
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
I don't mean like literally

1289
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,439
I mean a lot of it was ours

1290
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
But I mean it more like commitment

1291
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
Like I've been committed to the work

1292
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,863
An interested in engaged with the work since that Non-Stop

1293
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,959
Anything that's part of the thing is that I found something that I love

1294
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
To do and I

1295
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
Felt with it

1296
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
Feels like to love what you do

1297
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
And I've never been willing to

1298
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
To give that up

1299
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
And I've been on that track

1300
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Ever since

1301
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:53,599

Hey thanks so much for sticking around

1323
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
It's time now for how you built

1324
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,871
And today we're going to update a story we ran a little over a year ago and when we first heard about this product

1325
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,199
Our team actually got into a little bit of an argument because

1326
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,015
The problem that is meant to solve

1327
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,671
What was some people didn't even know this problem existed like if you have a comforter or a duvet

1328
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,511
Then you know the extreme frustration of washing the cover

1329
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:10,911
And then trying to stuff the duvet back into the duvet cover it says if you're taking it a bit

1330
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:17,311
Big pillow and trying to fit it into its pillowcase but it's bigger than you are and you can

1331
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,175
Jordan from San Diego

1332
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:27,295
Properly and neatly and it's not all crumpled inside and if you ever had to do this

1333
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,695
You know exactly what Chris was talking about has an enormous pain and it's something that she had to do when she was a kid

1334
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:38,815
Anyway that's Crystal for self she's always looking for ways to save time

1335
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Until one day

1336
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
Two years ago he died

1337
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:48,799
I want to design something that makes it easier to put the duvet back into the cover it needed to be absolutely simp

1338
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,383
That is Standalone you don't have to hook up any wires or

1339
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
Any hooks

1340
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,735
And doesn't require assembly or any of that

1341
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,063
Crystal actually has a background in aerospace engineering

1342
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,415
But when it came to designing something to help you make a bed

1343
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
She didn't even know where to start cuz I had no idea how to invent something so I started toying with things I I read a book

1344
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,143
On basically inventing things

1345
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:19,263
And bought some stuff from Home Depot really basic stuff they're like

1346
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,591
Ropes and clothespins and a kitchen sponge

1347
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,919
Which he literally stapled together into a kind of

1348
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Clamping device

1349
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,759
That was my ultimate first Raw

1350
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,575
Prototype 2 just passed my theory of

1351
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,415
Having this cushion underneath the mattress to work as an anchor

1352
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
And then having Clips just hanging onto

1353
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,279
The corners of the duvet and then

1354
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:46,911
And what Crystal eventually came up with is a flexible clamp actually two of them

1355
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:53,311
That you can use at the top two corners of the bed that clamps are kind of like liking it to the hands of

1356
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,151
Somebody else there your helping hand the clamps are sheep

1357
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,943
I'm like a spatula with his

1358
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Little plastic

1359
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,063
Gate in the middle that can hold the duvet cover in place

1360
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,623
As you pushed the duvet into it

1361
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:13,023
And you can do this task alone in a few seconds with with very minimal pain

1362
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:19,423
In time a few months after she's settled on her final prototype Crystal without a manufacturer in Turkey to

1363
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
Make it what she calls

1364
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,543
The duvets D UVA ID

1365
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
There's nothing like it that exists we have no competition since we last spoke with Crystal

1366
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
In a few thousand dollars selling the debate online

1367
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
And she's in the final stages of negotiating to get it into a national chain and a few weeks ago

1368
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
She got the duvet

1369
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:47,839
He keeps the letter from the patent office in a drawer with her kids birth certificates because that she puts it

1370
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
It's also something she gave birth to

1371
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,263
