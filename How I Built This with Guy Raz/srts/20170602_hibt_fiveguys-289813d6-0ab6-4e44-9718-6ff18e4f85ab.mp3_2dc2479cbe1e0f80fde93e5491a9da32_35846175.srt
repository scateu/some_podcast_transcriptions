And a long journey to get to where he is today

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,336
He was born in a small mining town in northern Michigan

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688

An adventurer he wasn't very family-oriented and he was a stunt pilot

35
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536

00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Kid where he says he was

37
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,288
The nuns used to say when are you going to end up selling hamburger something so

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
I did get through school and eventually

University of Michigan I got scared there I said my God how am I going to make it this world with all the smart people around

00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Endeavor

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
So after college Jerry moved back to his hometown and he married his high school girlfriend

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
I got a job selling life insurance and they had three sons but the marriage didn't last

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Ended up leaving and taking the kids to Florida and for Jerry

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
That was a low Point kind of floated around for awhile lived in different cities it wasn't sure what

46
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
Used to do with his life

47
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,928
But he was sure of one thing

48
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
You wanted your kids to live with you

49
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
How you do that why I didn't know

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Around the mid-1970s

51
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Jerry was offered at consulting job in the DC area so he took it and he moved to Alexandria

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Virginia

53
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616

Cheney

55
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
And after situation stabilized

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
His kids did

57
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Actually come to live with them

58
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
And it was also around that

59
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
I want Jerry decided

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Become a financial planner

61
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
DC area size I'm going to go back to the

63
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304

And that's what I did

70
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
To the boys move in with you

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920

Anna

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
Stuck in the back of my mind

112
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
Does people used to come from all over town to get Hamburg

113
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
And then when I moved to Washington

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
But only one place have a long line

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Whenever freshers

00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175

Cheapest simple might work

124
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
And that's where the idea came from

125
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
So what did you do did you

126
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
I mean did you go to your wife and say let's try Burger Joy

127
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Yes what you say

128
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Pocket same thing the banks

129
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Chat at the time

130
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
Are you guys on your mind

131
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
But we are

132
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
We did a little different

133
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
We said let's not put a lot of money in

134
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
Unless

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
Find the place where the rent is real law

136
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Out of the way

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Where nobody can see it

138
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Would you want to do it that way

139
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
And we said well if we can put it where

140
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
It's hard to find

141
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
But if we can get people coming there

142
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Then we know we got some

143
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
And this was in in 1986

144
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Yes

145
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191

147
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
In Arlington Virginia

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
And it was like a little

149
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Place in rent was cheap and what was the how much money did you have to put up to $35,000

150
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
What did that cover

151
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Everything

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
The the rent

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Equipment equipment

154
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
We found junk equipment rebuilt it ourselves

155
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
I was

156
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Stand up only

157
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
And

158
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Chad

159
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Matt were still in high school

160
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679

162
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Curry College

163
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
And if you want to go to college

164
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And now

165
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
They pretty much said

166
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
God would rather do something else

167
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
Wake up go back for a second you set your kids down

168
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
And if you had your kids college fund and you said to them

Hey look I got this college money I will send you to college

170
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Or

171
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,535
You cannot go to college we can use it to open up a burger joint

172
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Were you coming to eat

173
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
You can imagine today like a parent

174
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Saying that to their kids and then other parents saying

175
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
Your mortgage in your kids future on this burger joint yes

176
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Did you have any of that

00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,199
Feeling in your mind like maybe this is not a great was telling us it was right thing to do

178
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,319
Probably look back on it was probably assumed it was Cowboys kind of crazy

179
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
It was crazy it didn't seem crazy.

180
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
For some reason we all seem to be on board with

181
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999

00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215

Incorporate

191
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
You need to have a name

192
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
She fills out the paper

193
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
This was so well thought out that we didn't happen

194
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
So

195
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Boise

196
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
We had that

197
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Three Sons

198
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Plus one more sandwich

199
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Janie

200
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
My stepson wasn't born yet

201
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
So is four Sons with me so we should go out

202
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Call Five Guys for now and then we'll change it

203
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
So we get the papers fill out

204
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,615
Okay sign on your first day of the opening day 1986 did you

205
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
Detroit grand opening

206

Helena first open up at 11

207
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
There's no business at all until quarter 12

208
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
And then one person finally walked in and

209
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,327
12:30 we were we were almost packed and we made money for my very first day

210
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
We were breaking even and we're paying our rent

211
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,775
I need an employee's right cuz everybody was a couple employees but

212
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Mostly with the kids and we were

213
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,919
Paying them some I think the timer Pan Am 759 or something like that

214
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
How did you even know how to make

215
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,831
A burger I mean where you a good home chef with anybody in your family a good chef

216
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,719
Listen to come from my hometown can't make a burger you can't live so I'm in that we know how to make burgers

217
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
And I'm from where I'm from is

218
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Posen was right near Bissonnet raised potatoes

219
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,423
I grew up in a fire that we raised a lot of potato I know I know how to cook a potato

220
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
And I know you know how to cook a hamburger

221
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
That was born yet

222
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
Gorilla burger at a fried potatoes and that's all you really needed to know

223
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
What is the ingredients

224
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
How did you know

225
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
How to Source this

226
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
We went to Thrashers

227
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
In Ocean City

228
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
And looked on the potato bags

229
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
And we found out they came from Rigby Idaho

230
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
A guy named Rick miles

231
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Small potato dealer out there so we got ahold of him

232
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
I wish I could you show us potato

233
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
We did not know what the time that he was small

234
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Now he's become a multi-millionaire

235
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
We buy are potatoes from him

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
What was so special about his potatoes

237
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
They were sold by Thrashers in Ocean City

238
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
So you said

239
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
If there's a line outside the

240
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Potato Joy

241
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Potatoes must

242
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
I did good

243
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Be good

244
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
What was Five Guys offering

245
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Was it burgers

246
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,911
All the toppings and all that stuff we did with her kids

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Jamie and I would not

248
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
Tell the kids how much we were paying for the Prada

249
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
WeChat

250
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Whatever pickles you want to put on there

251
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Hamburgers

252
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
You guys pick

253
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Pickles

254
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
So they were trying different brands and different pickles

255
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Validate end up with the most expensive pickle

256
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
And we wouldn't say anything

257
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
Think about it would say okay that's a big what you want by those pickles

258
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
First

259
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,863
Okay then we will buy the most expensive cooking oil you want to cook in

260
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
That's where they cook them

261
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
City

262
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
They wanted to buy this bread from a little baker

263
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Arlington that made really good bread

264
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Brenner's Bakery

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Best bakery in Arlington

266
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
But for

267
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
My restaurant

268
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Expensive

269
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
We're paying about 7 times

270
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Trump hamburger buns

271
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
McDonald's

272
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
And what was the burger going for in 1986

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
I think we're sound sounds like three times four times at McDonald's

274
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
What sound for a crazy would make it that way

275
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
We didn't let

276
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
The kids know

277
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
How much we're paying for any of the food

278
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
So they would just go out there in

279
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Whatever it was

280
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
That they like it that's the way it was

281
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
And what was the thinking behind that

282
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Strategy

283
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
The thinking was that they're going to pick the best product

284
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
They got to pick with the customer likes what they like

285
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Give an example how ridiculous

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
Kids like to certain kind of mayonnaise cuz it was thick

287
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
And it would hold things together and that we were buying our mayonnaise at the time

288
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Guy up in New York City that was really hard to get along with and so when we hired our first purchasing age

289
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
He said there's no way that Manny's is this important no way to describe it so hard to deal

290
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,527
So we had all the family come in and do a blind mayonnaise taste

291
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,391
And to this day I can't eat mayonnaise by itself so we have like nine different

292
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
Dishes with mayonnaise and tactical spoon and everybody with

293
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
Taste of mayonnaise blindfolded and he shall improve together you can't tell the difference in this mayonnaise or any

294
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
And after the Ashley took a bath salts off my wife myself and all the boys pick the same initials

295
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Beacon New York

296
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
So why

297
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
King and I what we would do it at the end of the month we look at them

298
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Sales

299
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
And then we look at how much we paid for the food and we said we got to raise our prices

300
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
The kids didn't know why we raised

301
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
The prices but we would always say

302
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Food cost

303
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Stay around 30%

304
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Whatever we got to do

305
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
We got a raise prices

306
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Raise prices

307
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
And we have if we have to worry about price

308
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
We don't want to be in this bed

309
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Okay so you've got this

310
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
First Burger Joint right

311
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
And how did people find out about

312
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
How do people even know about

313
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
The only way would be

314
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Somebody else telling them they said there's a

315
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
Great burger places little like

316
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Why captcha

317
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
You got to try it

318
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
That's the only way they would have found out about

319
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,095
There was a place in DC when I first moved here at office downtown

320
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Lunch break

321
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
What was downstairs

322
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
It was an ally

323
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
And it was nothing on the door if I remember right just a steel door coming off the alley

324
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Butt.

325
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
All the offices around there

326
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
We go to this place

327
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
And I was on marked and it was an ally

328
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,599
I was always impressed with the fact that that guy could do that much business on there and I knew him I know how much money was made

329
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
He sold it

330
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
And within three months it was gone

331
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
The people were going there for the food

332
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
And it was working

333
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
And I sure want her to think I can do that then

334
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
I just will just open up in a corner and people like yourself, if they don't like us they want and then we won't be in the business

335
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:14,431

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
Chokecherry the sun's open.

368
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,551
Tiny burger joint in Arlington Virginia

369
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
And it first

370
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
People knew about it through word-of-mouth

371
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Record

372
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Eventually

373
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
Newspaper started to write about the burgers

374
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
And then the lines started to get longer

375
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,399
So Jerry and his family started to think about opening a second location

376
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
But

377
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
They needed the money to finance it

378
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
I remember going in the bank

379
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
They said they're going to do what the hamburger place

380
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
That was just a laugh. Us

381
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
But that

382
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Said we got friends

383
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,415
That their parents got a little bit of money and they know Five Guys is doing good

384
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Maybe we'll ask them for

385
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
For a few thousand

386
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
So we got

387
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,839
Eventually we got about a hundred fifty two hundred people

388
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
That would be blowing anyone time to give us some money

389
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
But not as invest

390
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Just for loans

391
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
We did it a different way we did it as investors would say

392
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Give us $5,000

393
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Will give you

394
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Certain percentage of the

395
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Gross not never that

396
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Prophet

397
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Cuz it was always too many ways

398
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Cheap people that way

399
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Do I said

400
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
We'll give you a certain percentage of the gross

401
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Will give you the money every single month

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
And

403
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,767
Anytime you want your money back you can have it there by shield-wall that's

404
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
Stupid because you have a blimp

405
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
I was going to come and ask for the money back

406
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
But my method to my madness was also that

407
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,751
I said to them anytime I want to pay you back I can

408
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Cuz I knew someday

409
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
If this thing was successful

410
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
Are you going to get better financing

411
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,687
I can go back to these people I'm paying back anytime I want

412
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
So you never gave them

413
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Said they weren't Equity owner

414
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Not in the real sense

415
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
We just made an outside

416
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
If the store does

417
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
20000 week you get

418
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Certain percentage at every

419
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
And we gave the money

420
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Exactly on time every month

421
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
We could always go back and ask for more money so how much money did you

422
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
Did you raise for to do store number 2

423
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
Waffle House store number to we probably only had to raise Maybe

424
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
150000

425
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,943
But we had we had a lot of people that just want to throw money at I say like the burgers

426
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,527
They like the fact that we are making money and what they were getting paid every month

427
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
I had a boat

428
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
75 people I didn't even know on that list

429
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
And I used to say to everyone

430
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Don't put your money in somebody else's business

431
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
It seems like a lot of people song Something Five Guys

432
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Were you

433
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
Fully committed to this or did you or you still doing financial planning program for an answer

434
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
At what point

435
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Do you say

436
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
To your kids your wife you know I'm going to give up

437
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
My job

438
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
And I'm going to focus on Five Guys full time

439
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Well that was almost the day I got hit in the head with a broom

440
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,159
I must have been having a bad day at the office or something then I went home and I said my wife I quit

441
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
She said

442
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
You got to be crazy nice enough I'm done I'm not going to work anymore

443
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
I'm just going to

444
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Concentrate on the burger business

445
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
She was

446
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Pretty upset

447
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
Because she thought this is too risky

448
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
And that you thought

449
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
I think we can make this

450
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Well I just I thought it was fun

451
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
Yeah I was told my kids I said

452
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
You don't have to be in this

453
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
If you want to be

454
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
Make sure it's fun pick something you like to do in the business

455
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,463
Okay so now it was like the entire family focusing full-time on Five Guys

456
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,279
What would like roles did everybody play

457
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Well

458
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,471
Jamie is like a a general and she is very organized runs office and everything but

459
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
My kids were able to go to investors and so I I kind of if it wasn't for

460
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,455
For them and my wife there be no Five Guys I didn't Bill Five Guys

461
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Isis

462
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903
Set around thinking that this thing is growing so fast I can't believe that you know they came up

463
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
But most of the new ideas

464
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
They pretend they listen to me soup I have lived in in the Washington DC area for a long time off and on

465
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
I remember you know driving to Virginia

466
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,055
In like you know 1999-2000 to get Five Guys burger in Virginia

467
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,639
I want it was still just what four or five locations

468
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
2002

469
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
Up until 2002 you grew up to five

470
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,111
And were you doing pretty well were you all making a decent living at that point

471
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
You guys must've been rich

472
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,024
No but the thing is we had figured out the nuts and bolts of the business by now

473
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Most franchisors

474
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Start off

475
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Franchise

476
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,496
We didn't start off the franchise we had no idea we're going to do that we start off the building family business

477
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
And we put 17 years into it

478
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
We figured out

479
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
How to do it right

480
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah so when it came time to franchise

481
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
We had a

482
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Perfect system

483
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,552
How did you done at that point say

484
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
You hate books franchise

485
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Build this thing out

486
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
My sons came to me about

487
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
19

488
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
Late night late 1990 and started

489
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Trying to convince me that franchise

490
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
And I was dead set against

491
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Really.

492
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
Because I didn't think there was any way I could convince other people

493
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
To do what we were doing

494
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
How did they change your mind

495
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Well

496
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
There was a guy

497
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Name Mark Moseley

498
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
It was selling franchise

499
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
For another company

500
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
She been watching Five Guys for a while

501
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
And

502
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
My kids

503
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Got me

504
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
To meet with him I didn't want to do it

505
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
They bought me a book called

506
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Franchising

507
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Dummies

508
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Written by

509
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Dave Thomas

510
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Old guy from Wendy's

511
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Yes okay

512
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
I'm sorry I read it and then and I

513
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
The legal stuff

514
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
I was amazing all the rules you have to follow on everything

515
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
So when they talked me into it

516
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
Because of her when you start franchising

517
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,184
First of all, the franchise either you're not going to worry about food cause I pretty

518
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Sounds pretty stupid

519
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,816
You Got Talent franchise either you're not going to advertise I saw a priest

520
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Stupid

521
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,656
You going to tell him that you're only going to sell hamburgers and french fries

522
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
We're all going to be open later we got to sell alcohol we got to watch Food cars Suite

523
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Shop around for rrproducts

524
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
I said I won't do that

525
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
99

526
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
We buy from people and we're going to stick with him

527
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
That was all hard to sell the franchise

528
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
But we we got through that

529
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
And I remember Mark coming in

530
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
Cuz he was going to be our salesman

531
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
He said he's going to sound like I can't remember how many stores are first year they're going to sell but I said

532
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,080
50 just cut down to 25 you don't have to sell 50

533
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,456
And I think within a year-and-a-half two years we sold 3500

534
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,856
We saw the whole United States

535
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
Burgers were still a lot more expensive than absolutely

536
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
Man takes longer to get a burger so

537
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,960
I need the business model is different so were you worried, did you ever think

538
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
Ghetto maybe this works in Northern Virginia but I'm not sure this is going to work

539
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Somewhere else

540
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Absolutely scared the heck out of us

541
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
You were talking about the long way

542
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
I used to have a sign at one of our stores

543
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
That said if you're in a hurry

544
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
There are a lot of really good burger places

545
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Near here

546
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Daddy can't put that sign up

547
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048

00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Alaska

00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Goderich

551
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776

552
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080

553
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,920
Richmond that's like down the road 90 miles it's nothing

554
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
But I couldn't even sleep last

555
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Nobody's going to know who we are Richmond Stover successful

556
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
And then I said well

557
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Now we're going to go to

558
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,488
North Kim

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
And I said no way we're going to Florida cuz people

00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328

00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Product in Florida cuz they're older people

562
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Florida

00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
I got a hundred stores in

564
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
The idea of going from

565
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Five stores in 2002

566
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
2

567
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Thousands of stars

568
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Within

569
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,248
Aur 2002 storage we seoul

570
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Franchise

571
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Those are still being built out

572
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
In the United States

573
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
We got about 1400

574
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Palmdale Tower

575
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
With all the territory the United

576
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Face is gone

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Was that just

578
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Mind-boggling

579
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Mine bazzi

580
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
Anna and I was I was so proud of my kids that didn't go to their head

581
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
They're still my kids

582
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,848
DreamWorks or something you said they work hard on everyday

583
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
What does it mean

584
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
What's it like to work with you or

585
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Five sons and in your wife I mean

586
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,088
They're all involved the coming what date did you do a different thing for the company

587
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
Well I have one son that

588
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Just love

589
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
Doing stuff in the store

590
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
Make sure they're painted right

591
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Decorated rice

592
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
He's really into that

593
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
So that's his job at 1:40.

594
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,008
About the food

595
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,640
So he goes around the world but not chosen how to cook things right stuff

596
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,248
I got another assignment that that he's really into the financial part of it

597
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
Grabbed it and I'm glad

598
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Because I don't understand a lot of

599
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Specialist International

600
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
Everybody's kind of found their own little debt show

601
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Business real

602
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,656
Some of my teaching some light working in the field

603
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
One of them just loves

604
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:54,080
Taking care of making sure there's no food borne illnesses in The Fanatic about and she loves doing it

605
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,944
Amazon.com find what they want to find an app that can't be

606
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
You still buy them that will hire somebody

607
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
Is your family still

608
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
The primary owner of the company

609
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Yes wait we on about 75% income

610
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Me and my family

611
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,512
We took in a fairly big investor but when I first start franchising

612
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
They don't interfere in our business at all they gave us

613
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Big chunk of money

614
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
Larry entrepreneurs do when they saw something

615
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Five Guys

616
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
What percentage of the actual

617
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616

Thesaurus and then over here we own

622
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
About 450 out of the 1400

623
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
How many countries

624
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Total is Five Guys

625
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
In-N-Out

626
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Where am I Great Britain

627
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Which

628
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,544
I guess it's still want country advocate for now UK stores are weird

629
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Who won France

630
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
We just opened up and

631
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Sean's did Jose

632
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
Storm madrid begat

633
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Several stores

634
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
The Middle East

635
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
So I

636
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
I think a lot of people when they get a little bit successful

637
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
They look back and try to figure out how they did it

638
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
I can't figure it out

639
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,632
Do you think a lot of it was luck

640
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,984
Who sings I give a lot of credit to my ballot great believer in

641
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Intuition or a higher power

642
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
God whatever you want to call it

643
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Great believer in not

644
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
Listening to my hunches

645
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
And

646
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,648
I could have got my own that's for sure

647
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
My kids are my wife cuz

648
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
Seems like to me without them nothing

649
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Dumb

650
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
We were lucky really lucky

651
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Real real lucky

652
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Do you

653
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Really your vision was not to

654
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056
Open up a burger joint your vision was to get

655
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Your kids to live with you

656
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
When you and your wife divorce

657
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
Which that was your I guess that was your real success

658
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Getting your kids

659
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,904
Are the best things ever have in my life is my kids there's no doubt about that

660
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
And the best thing that's happened to their mother

661
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
To my ex-wife

662
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
Is the fact

663
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
The rambling

664
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Do all kinds of wonder

665
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Yeah

666
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
And you still have a

667
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Pretty good relationship with her

668
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
My current wife

669
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
Hatuey William

670
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,360
We get along if she's benefited from your

671
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
The success of your sons

672
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
How did being

673
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Financially stable

674
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
End

675
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,344
Set out of that change your life were you able to do things that you

676
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
You couldn't do before

677
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Well

678
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
Most people that I know

679
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
I've known

680
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
Since I've been a kid

681
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
When I started Five Guys

682
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,912
Silent three or four my buddies that I went to HighSchool with

683
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Buy stock in my company

684
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
I thought it would be a great thing for

685
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Canadian hat

686
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Little bit a little bit

687
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
And one of my had a loan on the money

688
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
And they're all millionaires

689
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
But we're still

690
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
Same old people I mean I just had

691
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Bunch of money

692
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,672
Friends down from my Michigan a couple weeks ago on my boat

693
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Florida

694
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
We drink beer together

695
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
34 years ago

696
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
You can lead a pretty Anonymous life like knowing you're not walking on the street and no one's like there's Jerry the founder Five Guys

697
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
Know that my wife always says

698
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
She gets upset up

699
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
Sitting on the front yard

700
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Mercante beans

701
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,480
I always wear Levi's

702
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
But that

703
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
I don't

704
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,856
I don't know how other people look at me but

705
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,928
I don't I don't think anybody put on airs I hope not

706
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
Yes it's amazing what you said earlier that

707
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,888
That when he was a kid that the nuns said you were going to sell hamburgers

708
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
What about

709
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Your mom

710
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
What would you thought about

711
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
What you did with Five Guys hamburger

712
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
My mom like hamburger

713
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,944
Shoe cobbler with. That was a good idea that my mom used to say

714
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
If you can make good hamburger

715
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
Or serve good drink

716
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,088
Or get a good haircut your voice

717
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Have some to do you

718
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Have an income

719
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Jerry Murrell

720
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
Founder of Five Guys Burgers and Fries

721
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,144
Did you add up all of the restaurants in franchises around the world

722
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,240
He says they are approaching 2 billion dollars in Revenue

723
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Oh wait four years

00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,176
Has resisted selling milkshakes years ago after considerable debate

725
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
Some stores decided to start selling them with mix in flavors like peanut butter banana

726
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
Strawberry salted caramel and of course

727
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Bacon

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

740
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Asteroid today comes from Aiden emmolo she lives in Jackson Wyoming with her husband Jesse

741
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
They're two dogs the Husky is yazz named after the baseball player and the German Shepherd

742
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,064
Is Tuckerman and all four of them spend a lot of time outside in Jackson Wyoming so

743
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,184
Fly fishing trail running hiking with dogs love it the humans love it

744
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,584
Except for a small problem my dog Tuckerman I noticed the cloudiness

745
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Anodized when he was pretty young like only two years old and then we noticed Yeah Yeahs was getting pretty

746
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,384
Visible sunburn after we spent long days on the water Jackson Wyoming

747
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Wheely bright

748
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
And that's what happens a lot of dogs are sensitive to overexposure their eyes swell up

749
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Cloud over

750
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,184
And some dogs can even lose their Vision so to find a solution

751
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,256
Eden's husband Jesse started digging through their old

752
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Ski equipment

753
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
So he just started

754
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Chopping up

755
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
You got goals and came up with these

756
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,032
Retrofitted goggles for the dogs which one

757
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
Weiser they got from the Dollar Store take

758
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
To the old ski goggles I'll put together with a jumble of straps and hair ties I think I probably laugh

759
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
Felt loud when we first put them on it like this is

760
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,672
This is ridiculous but I guess you know what better a silly looking dogs in a blind dog

761
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
Even jessicat for finding the goggles until people started to ask them where can I get those for my dog

762
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,424
But they weren't sure there was an actual market for dog goggles

763
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
So

764
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,752
They decided to ask an expert their vet

765
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,848
So he put the Prototype down and looked across the table at us and said well

766
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
You're probably going to need some capital and I looked over and said yeah yeah I think we will and he's like well

767
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
I think that's our next conversation

768
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
Togaf their bad actually gave them some money enough money for Aiden and Jessie to find a manufacturer

769
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
In China and then launched their very first line the lenses range from neon pink to

770
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
Neon green a lot of people love the The Crazy Ones as it's because they make your dog look like some store

771
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:57,408
Superhero robot they make him look pretty badass

772
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:03,808
2 years ago they sold more than 10,000 goggles and are planning to release for new models by the end of the year

773
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
And she her husband quit their day jobs

774
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
College reunions and you know everyone's going around and I haven't seen you the right to do what do you do what are you doing

775
