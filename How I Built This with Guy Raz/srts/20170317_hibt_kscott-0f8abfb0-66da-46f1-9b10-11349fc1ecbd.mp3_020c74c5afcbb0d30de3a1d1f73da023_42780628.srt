30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Was

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
You know magical and I could become

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
Anything I wanted to be you know I would play in her clothes and her jewelry in

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
I would sketch ideas of clothes and Handbags and shoes I would

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,032
Brake antique pieces of jewelry apart and try to put them back together again I would style my mom

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
IMac I don't can't say it was great looking but it was creative like I could say that I loved it

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Lakendra really thought of fashion

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Is a hobby she never imagined it is this

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Things you would eventually

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Do with her life

40
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
By the time she turns 16

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Her parents marriage

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Just falling apart

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Kendra and her mom moved

44
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Houston

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Andover College

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
She decided on Texas A&M

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
But shortly after the start

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Her freshman year

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Her stepdad was diagnosed

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Cancer

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
So Kendra

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Dropped out

53
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Just was like you know what

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Right now this is the most important thing that I need to

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
To do and so dropped out of school

56
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
Move to Austin

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
And was spending you know an unbelievable amount of time

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
At MD Anderson in Houston

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
And

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
That's weird my first business actually started was

61
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,560
I went home and started designing headwear

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
For women undergoing chemotherapy

63
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
So you know there were times when

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
It would be in the hospital you know what he's in for treatment therapy

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
B7 hours in a procedure

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Two sitting in a waiting room

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Is really really

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
Hard to do for 7 hours so we would go out we would meet people would be in the cafeteria we meet women and Families

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
And I could just see one you know it's so devastating for

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Anyone who's going

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Through cancer

72
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
To treatment

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
For a woman you know.

74
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
To lose your hair as well it's a

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
The part of your identity and

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Either weren't great options

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
For these women

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
And I just started hearing the struggle

79
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:25,056
And I loved hats and I love fashion and I thought you know I could take some hats and if I could

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
And put in some cotton linings

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
Comfortable headbands things that would make them more comfortable to wear because a wolf

82
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
You know hat

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Is not comfortable when

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
When you've lost your hair

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Right

86
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
So this could be great you started to 2

87
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah so initially I wasn't making the app

88
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Size buying hats

89
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
And then I custard thinking about it I'm like you know

90
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Don't know if I could try to buy hats and I couldn't find them anywhere

91
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
I'm like no one is selling hats

92
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Where are all the hats

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
And so my first business was creating a hat store

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
With the intention that I could also have a

95
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Space in a place

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
4

97
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
People undergoing chemotherapy

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
To come that was

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Private

100
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
They could have a private area

101
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
To try hats on

102
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
I had to speak Spanish see that it was going to be like 1930 again

103
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
Everyone was going to wear hats and there was going to be this big

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
Movement of people wearing hats again

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
What is you

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
At that point meaning

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
Your stepfather was

108
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
He was battling cancer

109
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,423
AM 710 at the same time you launch

110
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
This company's Fitness

111
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,103
Yeah so you know it was a really crazy saying I remember talking to my father and my mother

112
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
And my stepfather and saying you guys I want to

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
I want to do this

114
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
And you know my unbelievably and I look back now like that my parents were like

115
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Okay do that I mean I think my mom was

116
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
Going through a lot so maybe she wasn't in the right state of mind but she's like

117
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,839
Do it honey and my dad was the same way and he said look you're not you spending the money I'd save for college

118
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
You know it wasn't much remember it being like $20,000

119
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,799
I bought my first inventory and sign the lease and all that kind of stuff what would you call the store

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
The hat box

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
We can't stop you for sec

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
You were like

123
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
1919

124
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
That's amazing so how did you even have

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Why this

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
You know

127
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
I think

128
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,879
Are you kind of go in things without necessarily

129
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Understanding like all the risk

130
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Let's do this

131
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
And you know it was amazing and I had to sell every hat so like

132
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
I clearly to make money I mean if you needed a top hat I had it

133
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
A joker hat

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
I had it

135
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
You know whatever a fedora a church hat

136
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Derby hat

137
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
I was your person

138
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
You open up and then what happen

139
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
People start to come in from day one

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
I'm not really

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Slow-twitch of color slow build

142
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,671
There wasn't the demand for hats that I really had dreamt

143
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
That there would be

144
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
We tried a lot of really Creative out-of-the-box Marketing tactics

145
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
But at the end of the day

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
We would sell some hats but it was it was tough

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
I mean I remember a lot of days

148
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Call my dad just

149
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Crying and being like

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Like that I sold one hat

151
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
You know and I've been there

152
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Like 12 hours

153
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
And I sold a hat

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
I was so determined

155
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
To make the Hat business work

156
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Which

157
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
I did it I mean five years after eating Top Ramen

158
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,719
Like struggling and working 7 days a week and open to close and I couldn't really afford to have anybody

159
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
I had to shut it down and I mean I failed

160
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Youjizz

161
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
We're losing money all the time hemorrhaging money

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Yes

163
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
You know I remember when I close the hat box

164
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
You know saying I would never go into retail again

165
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
It was just too hard

166
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
You know hear my store closed

167
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
My stepfather now passed away

168
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
From cancer

169
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
You know it was just a very dark

170
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
Working sad time and I fail

171
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
I completely failed it

172
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
It's something that he was one so proud of

173
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
So I really felt like I had let down him and so many ways

174
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
But

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
I think at that time I was like okay

176
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Go get a job

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
And so

178
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Yeah wet and I was able to

179
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,567
To get a job at a local travel company that had a magazine associate

180
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
And I was able to do some really creative things

181
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Building this magazine for them and

182
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Respond by

183
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
I wanted to do my own thing again

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Yeah

185
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
And what about your own life

186
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Anyway you

187
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
We married at that

188
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
Got married in 2000 so about the time that was all going

189
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Bad I did have that one you know bright light of

190
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Getting married and

191
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
And then in 2001

192
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Having our first son

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
So

194
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
That was really a

195
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Catalyst for me because

196
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
The job that I was doing what you know at the magazine

197
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Required me to travel

198
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
A lot

199
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
So I really knew

200
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
At that point that I needed

201
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
To figure out something else

202
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
And

203
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
I realize that you know what I loved was

204
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
I love fashion I love to sign

205
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
And with the hatbox I saw what a difference

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
What I love could do to help other people with you know the hats for women undergoing chemotherapy and I thought that if I create a company

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
I could also do something really

208
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Good

209
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
But that would be success for me

210
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
And that literally was the foundation of Kendra Scott

211
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
How did you land on

212
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
On jewelry design

213
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
You know I could make it with my own two hands

214
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
I can't spell to save my life

215
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
So you know I loved

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
All that facets of

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Fashion and design

218
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
But jewelry was always like the icing

219
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
It was that extra Sparkle

220
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
It always Fit 2

221
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
So when your pregnant

222
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Believe me jewelry is very important because you're wearing potato sacks so if you can put on a great statement necklace y'all

223
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
All sudden feel glamorous

224
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
So I think being pregnant

225
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
I was looking for beautiful

226
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Gemstone jewelry

227
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
That I could afford

228
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
And it wasn't out there

229
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
It was either inexpensive

230
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Plastic glass

231
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
The fall apart after one time wearing it

232
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
Or semi-precious jewelry that way

233
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
With so far

234
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Out of my reach was unattainable for me

235
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
And I just felt like there was this

236
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
White space

237
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
And the jewelry industry

238
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
That

239
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
For women like me who wanted beautiful

240
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Quality product

241
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
But needed it in the more tangible

242
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,799
Point and that's really going to kind of what I set out to

243
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Do when I created my first line

244
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,199
How did you even know how to

245
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,063
So I took some very simple jewelry making classes here in off

246
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Send

247
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,207
There's a local feed shop that had some classes that I took on wire wrapping and

248
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,071
And then I would look at things and I literally would break them apart to try to figure out

249
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
How they were made

250
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,935
And I set up shop in the extra bedroom of our house

251
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,823
I had some fold-out tables that my mom gave me a beadboard pliers and some wire

252
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:55,967
And I'm and that's what the first collection was made out of you just literally started making jewelry

253
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
I literally started just making jewelry

254
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
When I was finished I remember looking at it going you know what this isn't half

255
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Bad

256
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
You know I think people would like this

257
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
What it look like

258
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
It was Color Film was I love colors

259
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
So

260
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
I was trying to mix

261
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Color in a unique way

262
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
ISO putting

263
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
Stones together that might not typically be

264
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Put together and create really pretty colorways

265
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
And it was

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Hand-beading hand-knotted

267
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
Wire wrap Silhouettes with some chain and they were like

268
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Bracelets

269
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
Pendants and what were they necklaces beaded bracelets we did

270
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Necklaces

271
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,951
But I was known for my earrings on my chandelier earrings and really pretty drippy Stone

272
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
You know earrings and

273
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Long

274
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,631
Shoulder dusters and so yeah I I I put those little pieces that I made and I I literally

275
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Took $500

276
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm to get all the supplies I need it to

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
To create this

278
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Collection

279
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Which was a big deal for us

280
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
You know our

281
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Mortgage I I remembered at the time being around

282
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
$1,500

283
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
So

284
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
$500 is a lot

285
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
And we are going out we have a newborn baby and you know it was

286
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Like

287
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,487
Here's Kendra one of her crazy ideas you know the hatbox had failed my husband's probably like what is she doing

288
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
I promise I'm going to bring home $1,000

289
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
So how

290
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Did you think you were going to do that

291
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
I went out and I put this jewelry

292
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
In a tea box

293
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
A wooden tea box

294
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
I'm actually we've gotten for as a wedding gift

295
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
Took my little son Cade in a BabyBjorn and we went store to store in Austin

296
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Asking people if they be in

297
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
Exactly was any part of you nervous about doing

298
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
Oh my gosh yes I remember sitting in my car

299
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
Outside of the first store for probably 20 minutes

300
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Just

301
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
Figuring out like what I was going to say and if they were going to kick me out like if you know they called

302
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,287
Security or something but I thought I did have the baby so I felt like I was in better better shape but

303
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
I was so passionate about it and I think when I walk

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
True that passion shine

305
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Andrew

306
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Soap so what was your pet

307
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
So I had a very basic line sheet

308
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
And an order form that I printed off of word

309
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
And went in and I said hey I'm Kendra

310
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
Scott and I've got a jewelry collection and I always joke that

311
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
You know I don't know if they love the jewelry or they just felt really sorry for me or the baby yarn bright

312
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Baby I take a look

313
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,823
You got to pull out all the stuff I like whatever it takes

314
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,967
And I know that they bought it and so are they wrote orders and I ain't no literally the last store I went

315
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
To that day

316
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319
I had to sell my entire sample set

317
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
So that I would have enough money

318
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
To buy the materials I needed to

319
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Is the orders I want that day

320
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
And I came home with a check

321
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
$1,200

322
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
Ana member walking in and you know tell my husband I'm like

323
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
We got a business

324
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
So that

325
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
After that day of

326
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Play hockey at door-to-door

327
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Store to store

328
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
You had two basic

329
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Just go back into

330
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Get to work you to start making lists

331
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
Stop completely and I remember like I put a bulletin board up on the wall

332
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
And I have like my four orders

333
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Pens like

334
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
It was so big time like what was in production

335
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
And you know I ended up getting one of my friends to come over and taught her how to wire wrap and she like help

336
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
Make a new sample set and then also

337
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Produce these orders

338
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
And delivered him and I remember

339
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
The day after I delivered one of the store she called she's like I'm out

340
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
100 need more and I was like

And it was just kind of like oh my gosh and it was exciting it was really exciting because

343
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
People loved it

344

And it was fun because he here I'm an awesome just telling these stores and

345
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
Then another store in Lake Dallas what hear about it and I

Harold's stores but

They were a company that had a great catalog business and stores a good retail chain

368
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
But they were my first big order

369
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
And they came to Market

370
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
I remember the rapping like oh don't sample for them like they never really buy anything and they stamp all the time I'm like a wolf

371
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
I don't have anything to lose

372
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
I'm so I made samples up

373
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
Per their request and like wrapped up in tissue with

374
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,983
Like ribbon I don't know I might even put perfume in the Box I was like butterfly release do you know

375
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
And like if I'm going to do it I'm going to

376
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:13,919
Try to do it and sure enough I got a call and it was a $75,000 order

377
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
How many pieces was that

378
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
It was I think I want to say it was

379
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
Play 2200 or I mean it was like in the thousand

380
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Sky

381
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
How did how did you even manage to start making

382
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
You fake it till you make

383
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Cuz they had no idea I was in my

384
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,839
Extra bedroom and that was when I was like oh my God I have doubts

385
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Production

386
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Clearly can't make all these

387
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Please and they wanted it delivered in

388
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
In like 8 weeks

389
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
And I said yes to everything cuz

390
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
I was like okay I will do that

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
And a member of the buyer you know when she gave me the order

392
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Started crying on the phone to her and I just said

393
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
You just made somebody

394
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
These businesslike happen

395
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
And it we're still friends and she says like she still remembers that moment because I was so emotional

396
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
But we did it so we actually called a friend to

397
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
I had worked as a

398
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
CEO of a very large retail chain

399
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,399
He had some production a resources overseas

400
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
They have the stone capability there to which we

401
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
It's great so it was all natural stones I remember it

402
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
Key as a friend

403
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
I called and said can you help my friend out and literally thanks to him that first order was produced on time

404
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
And we shipped it out

405
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,927
Ticketed and carted on my dining room table and UPS up picked it up on my front doorstep

406
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
You know it's

407
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Biggest lesson

408
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
I can ever give any entrepreneur

409
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Don't be afraid to ask for help

410
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,143
It is not a sign of weakness it is the greatest sign of

411
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,727
Strength

412
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
When we come back in the moment

413
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
How the 2008 recession almost killed Kendra's business

414
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
I saved it

415
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,247

The Bold way to study

431
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,407
People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees

432
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
But annuity

433
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,783
These can be a smart way to hedge Market risk and earn guaranteed return

434
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:04,671

What all states

441
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Hey welcome back to how I built this

442
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
This from NPR

443
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Gyros

444
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
So it's the early 2000s

445
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
And Kendra Scott

446
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
Just landed her first big order

447
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
But if she wanted to make it national

448
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
She'd have to give her jewelry

449
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Into the famous

450
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Fashion showroom

451
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
New York

452
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
And I started calling them and sending them samples and you know

453
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Nobody would call me back

454
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,351
I would send cupcakes I don't know it's a southern thing here we need a lot of cupcakes

455
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,191
Anything I could get to try to get a response out of the showroom is it in the

456
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Just weren't interested

457
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
No and not be told I get 20 calls a day like

458
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
What's going to make you special

459
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,479
Do you have any jewelry designers are out there or wannabe jewelry designers

460
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,319
I can't tell you like how many times I got told no and and

461
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,951
Basically kind of laughed at and told oh you're from Austin Texas what are you selling Southwest jewelry

462
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm like no hello I'm selling baseball

463
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
They want to put you in a box right and

464
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,519
It was really good flading but you just have to like have it like I'm not going to let this fail

465
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
And I remember one showroom out of like the

466
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
20 or 15 and I was

467
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
According

468
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
Finally called me back and he's like will you just like stop

469
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
Calling me like

470
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
You like I will talk to you

471
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
But you have 20 minutes and you need to come to New York

472
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
And I'm like okay

473
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
I meant I'm coming

474
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
And like this Saruman in York like sell jewelry from

475
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Different designers

476
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
So this is a wholesale showroom

477
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
So they'll carry multi-lines

478
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Some carry

479
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,567
Multiple lines of jewelry some would carry handbags jewelry other accessories

480
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
But wear whatever and this is where buyers so the buyers

481
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Department stores buyers of Boutique

482
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
This isn't

483
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Direct-to-consumer this is not a store this is a actual

484
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
Showroom for Jose

485
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Right

486
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
And so this was a really great one

487
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
And again not too big so I will

488
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
If I get lost in

489
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,143
He was a tough New York guy and he wasn't kidding about the 20 minutes and I went in and

490
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Show to my collection and tried to

491
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
Explain to him what my goal invasion was

492
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Weather Brandon

493
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:32,127
He said you know if I'll look it over I'll talk to the rest of the folks at work with me and we'll get back to you kind of thing

494
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,711
And you know 22 minutes later I walk down

495
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Kind of deflated thinking

496
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
You know

497
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
I don't think he's going to

498
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
Like I don't think that one is great as I wanted it to

499
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
And it was about

500
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,207
3 days later and I was driving on

501
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
Loop 1 in Austin Texas and

502
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
You know my cell phone ringing

503
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
Lisa Kendra

504
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
We want to carry your line and I had to pull over

505
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
High on the highway

506
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Did not say

507
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:03,615
But yeah it was something that we know we got a New York showroom and that we really we sold into Nordstrom the next Market

508
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
What what is it what is it mean

509
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
Was the design

510
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Like markedly different from any

511
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Out there

512
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Or was it just a disk I happen to like

513
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Your stuff

514
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
I think that

515
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,488
That you know like he wouldn't have carried it if the design wasn't good

516
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,864
You know he sees a lot of things so I thinking of the design was good I think he was excited about the price point

517
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
I think he saw that there was value and there was

518
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
That would be exciting for customers to be able to have that and it was something that

519
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
That she didn't have to show

520
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
And again like we were filling a void

521
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
And that was the reason that we got his attention

522
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
How did you even know for example like

523
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Adam

524
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Ice things

525
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
How did how to do all that

526
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
I did it guy every time I kind of learned as I went along then we went overseas we

527
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
We're able to buy better you know

528
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
2 volume we're going to rock to Stone manufacturers verse

529
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,960
Going through importers and exporters and in all these other moments

530
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
So it worked out that we were able to actually

531
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Play really price

532
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Is smartly and for me

533
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
The more directi

534
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Could go

535
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
I could pass that value on door

536
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Customer and she could get the most

537
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Beautiful

538
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Stone quality

539
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
Handcrafted jewelry but under $100 for a pair of earrings

540
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
And it really was about

541
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Like getting out there and trying to source

542
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
You know

543
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Manufacturers in the stomach

544
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,328
To do it okay so go back to the the New York showroom

545
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
And then that the Nordstrom's order what did you

546
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Look how were you able

547
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
To fulfill that

548
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
Yeah so we were able to

549
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Start working with a sourcing

550
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
Company who started helping us

551
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,408
Diversify our manufacturing and give us more resources

552
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,272
And so when we were you know got the first Nordstrom order at this point I was still

553
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,136
I'm in the extra bedroom so we actually did ship Nordstrom out of the dining room again

554
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
And then we shortly moved to our first

555
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
A corporate

556
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Headquarters

557
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Which was an ad

558
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
It was in Attica where was that

559
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
It was an Austin it was little Victorian house that had

560
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,520
Subway office Beloit Subway shop office below it and

561
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
It was an attic space I'm ever going in his like will we have the attic available in like how much is it he told me I'm like okay I think we can

562
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Swing the Attic

563
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
Alvin and then we moved into an addict so

564
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
It was a big upgrade

565
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
From my extra bedroom light

566
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Let me tell you

567
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
You and

568
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
If we had about ex employees

569
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
Wow yeah we were

570
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
We're on fire guy

571
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
So I had a lot of production

572
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Assistance at that point

573
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,752
Literally helping make all the samples create all the samples and house

574
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
I had a graphics

575
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
Designer I really believed early I like I wanted to control the brand and I think you know working in the magazine for a while

576
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Just saw the power of

577
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Of having an authentic

578
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Tech brand that

579
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
You know we really

580
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Controlled

581
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
She was

582
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Was basically designing

583
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
Jewelry and you were over saying

584
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
The design of each

585
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,536
No I was designing they were they were producing

586
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
In the early days I was designing every single

587
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
Now I still lead the design

588
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
For the entire collection

589
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
We have six employees

590
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
By this point where you already

591
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Were you making a lot of money

592
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Yourself

593
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
What are you still

594
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
No not at all

595
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
I got it all there I mean there were lots of times

596
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Since when I didn't

597
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
I didn't pay my

598
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,952
Yeah I had to pay everybody else I'm at remember telling my landlord on several

599
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Vacations

600
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Address

601
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
First of the month

602
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
So Nordstrom's

603
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
Check is running a little late

604
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Could I have like two more days

605
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,312
And he just smile at me and be like no problem he was not for newer he was

606
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
So wonderful and so thankfully I had a cool landlord in

607
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
If we were floating

608
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
Constantly I had it I think I had about a $10,000 float

609
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
That I was always in my mind

610
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
I have like when things are coming in and when I could pay thing

611
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
I was going to pay rent

612
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
Pay payroll and

613
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
You know pushing people off to figure out who I should

614
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah and I bootstrapped adeyemi at this point I didn't I didn't bring any invest

615
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Capital N so I had a line

616
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Netcredit

617
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
With the bank

618
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
Against my inventory and my

619
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Purchase orders

620
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
How big was Goliath

621
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Well

622
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
The very first line of credit I got I think

623
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Quiz about 25000

624
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Then and then I got it moved up to 50

625
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
And I had a $50,000 line of credit

626
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
For a while

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
And then I remember

628
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
It went to 75 now

629
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
The big miles

630
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,352
Like then I didn't know how you go out and raise money or bring an equity or

631
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
I don't know how you do that I was just worried about

632
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
Filling the orders that I had to fulfill

633
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Yeah

634
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
What did you quit

635
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Decide to

636
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
To open a brick-and-mortar shop

637
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
So do you remember I said I would never

638
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Going to retail again with a hat box

639
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
Those are like famous last words

640
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Spot

641
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,344
I didn't for a long time I was honestly really scared

642
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Really really

643
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
And I thought this is much better I can

644
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Can design

645
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Make Me Over manufacturing and I'm selling

646
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,608
To these Hotel Partners they have the product and they have to sell it right like it was safe

647
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
We were growing but we weren't growing dramatically

648
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
It was like

649
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
We were at about a million million 5 year

650
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,616
You know at this point now I was a single mom

651
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
So you know I

652
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,248
I was able to pay our rent and do the things I need to do first marriage

653
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
It ended

654
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
Yep HobbyKids

655
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Two little boys

656
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Until you are doing this

657
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Smallest drone

658
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
And running a bit

659
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Yes

660
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Yeah Becca my little one he was

661
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
1

662
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
And the other one was

663
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
3

664
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
So they were little little little

665
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
So they wouldn't you know they come to the attic with

666
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
And I had a pack and play and

667
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
Toys in

668
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
To me those are

669
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,224
Magical day is quite honestly it was very special time for me and the boys it was hard

670
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
But it was like there there is that determination like

671
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
I couldn't

672
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Fail that

673
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Had to make this

674
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
What's work did you have help from your mom

675
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
Albert child-rearing

676
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,024
She's unbelievable she is just

677
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
Yes and my sister actually moved in with me for part of that time

678
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
Travel and try to sell your line

679
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
Yeah and I brought Kate my oldest I would bring his 75,000 freak

680
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Flyer miles and he was three and a half

681
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Irene

682
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
You should act for kid

683
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
I think back now I don't even know who this person is and how I did it cuz I don't think I could do it now but

684
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,392
Again asking for help I mean I had some friends in New York

685
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Who would help with

686
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
My son when I was there doing the shows

687
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
I mean I surrounded myself with these amazing wonderful p

688
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
People who

689
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Had big heart

690
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Who believed in me

691
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
And you know I'm so thankful

692
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Because I couldn't have done this without

693
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
The people around me to support me during this time

694
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
So you decide to

695
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
To open a brick-and-mortar store

696
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Austin

697
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,464
So here we are we're going along I'm just telling my little orders to all these Hotel counts in this amazing

698
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Wonderful thing happen

699
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Dance called the

700
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Recession

701
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Which

702
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
Turns out to be the greatest gift

703
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Kendra Scott

704
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Company ever received

705
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
Which sounds really crazy but it really was the greatest gift because

706
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
I was sitting at

707
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Safe

708
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
I was so scared to go outside of my comfort zone

709
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
You know seeing what happened with

710
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
My first business

711
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
But then the recession hit

712
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,576
And everyday I'd walk in and stores I've been working with

713
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
What 4 years were shuttering

714
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,720
One after another buyers that I had been working with and built these great relationships with

715
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
We're getting laid off from their job

716
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
I mean the whole world

717
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Changed

718
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
And

719
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,424
My line of credit gets called by the bank

720
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Because I'm a high-risk

721
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Pink fashion and Jewelry

722
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
And all these things were happening and I was like

723
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
In a literally on my kitchen floor

724
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
Stopping like I'm going to lose all of this

725
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
You no answer

726
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
I got these boys

727
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
I have to race

728
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
That was like a very scary time and it made me

729
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Have to

730
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Make a decision like in that mower

731
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
I was either going to give up

732
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
And just say I can't do this

733
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
And it's over party's over

734
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
Or I was going to have to throw all my chips on the table

735
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
And we are going to have to do something like

736
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Radical

737
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
And that's what we decide

738
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Headed to do

739
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,176
What you do radical meaning retail

740
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
So your answer was

741
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
We we got to go out there

742
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
And open up shop

743
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,136
Well what my answer was is that for all these years I've been worrying about what buyers

744
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
The buyers

745
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
I wasn't thinking too much about the customer

746
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
And I realized I had to refocus

747
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,864
That all of my attention had to go on the customer

748
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,960
I had to know what she wanted more of I had to engage with her

749
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Personally

750
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,336
And so our complete Focus went from business-to-business to business-to-consumer

751
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
And that man an amazing wealth experience

752
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,760
And it meant being Innovative and creative with creating a customization opportunity for

753
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Our customers

754
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
And

755
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Store

756
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
Really was meant to be our labret

757
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
So we moved our

758
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Our office

759
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
2

760
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Above store in

761
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
In South Congress in Austin Texas

762
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,400
To all of us would have to walk through the retail store every day

763
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
Before we can get to our offices

764
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
That we were four

765
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
I really have to

766
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
To see what was going on and look at the product in a fresh

767
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Perspective

768
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
How did you finance

769
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
I mean the recession-hit

770
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
You are

771
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
You know kind of

772
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Profitable but you're not really

773
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Crazy

774
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
So how are you able to

775
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Put the money into getting a retail space

776
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Then going that route

777
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,536
So a great thing happened I was with it when I was with this bigger Bank

778
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
We're not going to name any names but when they work about

779
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Caller line we had a local

780
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Texas Bank

781
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
2

782
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,056
Loved me loved our brand and took our line of credit on gave us an extension

783
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
In addition to the line of credit

784
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
They took on which one

785
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Was phenomenal

786
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
And really helped us

787
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Fortunately because of the recession

788
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:22,112
All these stores were shuttering so I was going to South Congress which is now the hottest hippest place in Austin

789
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
In 2008

790
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
2009

791
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
It was

792
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,816
Almost a ghost town and so negotiating a great lease and getting space

793
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
Was actually

794
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Pretty easy right

795
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,960
But I thought you know if we're going to do it I want to do it totally different than ever

796
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
I don't want to just open a jewelry store

797
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,128
I don't know if you've been into a jewelry store but it's kind of scary

798
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Play sometimes there's a

799
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Like cases

800
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
You have to ask

801
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,808
People do strange things it's scary

802
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Sometimes

803
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Burly guards at the

804
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
The Gate of the door it's

805
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
It's not exactly a warm and fuzzy feeling when you walk in and so

806
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
We want to take all the scary out of

807
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
Out of it and so the cases were open

808
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Jewelry with

809
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Fraley displays

810
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Canino tables

811
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,752
Then you could touch and feel it and we had signs that said have fun try on

812
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
You know we had the color bar where

813
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
You can sit at the bar and customize your own pee

814
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Piece of jewelry in pic

815
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
Stones that would go in the setting and then our girls right in front of you

816
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,808
Woodstock the stones while you're drinking a glass of champagne

817
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
It was fun

818
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
It was fun and it was fresh and it was

819
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
The jewelry with a

820
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Hannibal

821
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
And I think in the recession it was

822
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Refreshing for p

823
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Cuz it was something that

824
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Afford to do and it made them feel

825
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
We had lines

826
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Around the block

827
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
I couldn't believe it

828
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
How did you

829
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
How are you

830
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
The scale app

831
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
At one store

832
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Did you

833
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Have to eventually

834
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Get outside investment

835
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
So

836
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Not with the second

837
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Pet store

838
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,296
Or the third store so we didn't bring in

839
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
Investment Capital until 2

840
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
2012

841
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Very small amount

842
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
I mean I was running a business everyday that way

843
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Was bigger than it was the night before

844
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
I didn't know what

845
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Doing and I knew I needed to bring in

846
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,936
I'm more qualified team so Union 2010 we still only had seven people

847
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
You know we are

848
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,312
Walgreen right we were young we were hard-working we definitely

849
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,640
We're in a passionate and excited but I needed to get some gray hair

850
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
In the building

851
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
So to speak

852
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
And

853
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
In order to do that we know we needed also have money to do

854
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Intuit we brought in

855
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
Cool who is

856
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
Fantastic and with me to this day

857
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,024
And you know I stop paying myself actually when I hired him

858
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
Because I knew we had to have him

859
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
I knew I needed that you know expertise and I remember going to our controller who's now my VP of HR

860
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
And and saying Christine like we got to hire this guy and she's like country we can

861
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Can't afford him

862
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
And it's like we can't not afford him

863
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
I said stop paying me

864
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
We're hiring him

865
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
And I'm and they did and then finally you know our Smyth EOL on who is Whitney still he laughed when they he real

866
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
Realize that I wasn't getting paid

867
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
Cuz I was like she wasn't that long but she's like

868
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
I think we needed thank you

869
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,960
Maybe get paid I'm like okay that'd be great

870
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
What's up with you as an investment you were able to

871
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Scale-up

872
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
The point where you not have

873
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Volume 50 stores

874
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
54 right now and will have a

875
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
74

876
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,088
And you still sell in big retail

877
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Blake Nordstrom

878
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136

Yeah Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Bloomingdales

880

You know I think

881
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
If you would have asked me next

882
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Two bedroom if I would have ever thought the

883
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
This business would be as big as a

884
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
Stay I would have

885
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
No way could I have dreamt

886
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
But now

887
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
I see it

888
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Early days

889
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008

In the early days it was also there's a

903
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Exciting

904
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
2 because

Anxious because I just wanted to get up and I wanted the sun to rise so I

00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Don't do it

908
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,856
And I still in that way I mean I wake up at 3

909

Three 4 in the morning and I have ideas and I have asked

00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
You feel like

Love it love it like your children love it

919
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
It's amazing to me that

920
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
You

921
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Didn't finish college

922
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Are you barely did a year

923
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
I wouldn't even say I really

924
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Eat you never

925
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
You never studied business

926
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
You didn't study facts

927
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Dopest

928
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Credible

929
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Business

930
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
You failed a lot

931
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
You had a lot of

932
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,632
Bring out all my positive attributes

933
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
How much

934
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
How much of this do you think was

935
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Your

936
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Helen

937
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
How much of it was

938
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
How much it was

939
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,432
I don't know block me I don't I don't really believe in lots

940
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
This is been very hard you know there were a lot of days I didn't

941
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Think that I would

942
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
This business

943
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
I think

944
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Part of it is

945
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Is drive right

946
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
And I saw where we needed to go

947
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Giving up with not enough

948
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
I was going to figure

949
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Hear this out

950
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,328
And I think I've learned so much from the hatbox

951
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
That was my Edge

952
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
Education me I learned

953
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
Business from A to Z from open to close

954
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Literally close

955
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
You can't teach that in a book

956
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
You can't learn that in a class

957
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
What do you think would here like watching

00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176

Design

980
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
Original $500 investment

981
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Paid off pretty big

982
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Last December

983
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,408
Berkshire Partners made a large investment in

984
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Company

985
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
It's closed but according to a report in Reuters

986
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,112
Berkshires investment raised the value of the company

987
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Billion dollars

988
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
Please don't turn it off just yet in a moment

989
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
We're going to hear from you about the things you guys are built

990
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,616
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors Cleveland Clinic

991
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,200
Cleveland Clinic is ranked number one in the nation in Heart Care

992
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528

994
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,648
Is it clevelandclinic.org

995
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Heart Care

996
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Hey thanks

997
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Sticking around because it

998
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
It's time now for how you built that and we got this story from Joshua esnard who grew up

999
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
In Ithaca New York we were immigrants from St Lucia in the Caribbean and my dad being an old school car

1000
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Caribbean guy

1001
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
Everyone knows about the old school parents they cut their children's hair they did but his dad

1002
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
Kids version of a haircut

1003
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:24,160
Was not exactly Joshua's idea of a haircut and I wanted to edge up my hair and have a cooler hair

1004
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,768
Hairstyle so I realized that I need to find a way to give myself

1005
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
The styles that all the cool kids at

1006
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,632
Joshua didn't have the money to pay a barber

1007
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,728
And we tried giving himself a cut with his dad's Clippers

1008
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
Well I ended up with bald spots and

1009
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
Let's just say that I spent

1010
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
A lot of time in middle school with hats on my head

1011
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
Joshua is 13 at the time

1012
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
And the kind of kid who loved

1013
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
To draw and Design

1014
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,416
Diana I realized that if I can cut some pieces of plastic and cardboard

1015
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,256
And mess them together for certain designs and stencils

1016
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,328
I may be able to use that as a guide

1017
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,144
To help me cut my hair

1018
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
Basically he head stencil

1019
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
He present

1020
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Against his head

1021
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,080
And then head shave around it and the first haircut was

1022
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Perfect

1023
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Like the crisp

1024
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,688
Curves on my sideburns

1025
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:23,808
We're just amazing to the point that people were like man you went to the barber

1026
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
Who's your Barber

1027
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
Me I'm the barber he would say

1028
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
And Joshua kept using his stencil through middle school and then high school and in his mid-20s

1029
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,864
Has he decided to patent his invention

1030
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Within a few months

1031
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
The cut buddy

1032
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,752
Was born so I actually took the product

1033
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,592
And I shot a video of me cutting my own hair

1034
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
With the cut buddy

1035
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
He put it on YouTube and got some sales but also maybe this is because Joshua doesn't have the

1036
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Best hair for this sort of thing

1037
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
Some people started to

1038
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,440
Troll him oh my goodness he has a receding hairline his product

1039
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,464
Sucks but

1040
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
What they didn't realize was that

1041
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,096
The main issue was obviously me as the model

1042
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
So Joshua

1043
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Cast out

1044
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
4 guys with the

1045
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
The perfect hair 2

1046
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
Demo his product on YouTube

1047
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
And those videos they actually started to work

1048
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
He started selling like

1049
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
You doesn't cut Buddies

1050
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Day

1051
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
And then

1052
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,200
What a popular DIY site posted

1053
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
In one of the videos

1054
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
It went viral

1055
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,576
I'll never forget it I'm putting on my clothes

1056
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
And my phone just starts going

1057
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:36,512
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

1058
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,352
Notification read the orders started coming through the website

1059
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
And it turns out the cut buddy works on all different types of hair

1060
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Appeals to a lot

1061
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
A different kind

1062
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
It would be the college student

1063
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,336
Who's cutting their own hair under a dorm

1064
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,919
It would be the single mother or father who has to cut

1065
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,711
To children's hair

1066
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
In this trying to save some money

1067
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,807
It would be the barber that's in training

1068
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
That's who's lyrics

1069
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,975
One video went viral Joshua quit his day job and he started selling the cut buddy

1070
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999

1074
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,703
