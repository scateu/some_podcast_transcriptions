00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Presenting this mess

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When it comes to investing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
We all have Quest

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
And investor.gov has answers

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,264
If you're free resource for

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
Tools tips and information about investing

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Before you invest

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Investor.gov

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
Every store we open between our opening in 62 our first built

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
165 R Plaza De Lago store on 68 and 71

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
Every time was betting the company every time every time and every time

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
And we knew if we failed the company might go down

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
From NPR is how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Idealist and the stories behind the movements they built

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Gyros and the story of how Gordon Segal

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
Mike Carroll built the house where is Empire Crate & Barrel from one little scrappy storefront in

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Chicago

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,752
It helps that single shop help change the way we furnish our homes and apartments

20
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
It was probably a good chance at

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
You have a piece of bike

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,016
Ikea furniture somewhere in your house or apartment

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
It probably looks pretty good right you know nothing fancy but

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
Functional well-designed kind of European looking

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
It's

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
Put back in 1861

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,400
If you wanted vaguely European looking furniture or plates or

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Whatever in America

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
You had to be rich

30
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
1961

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,128
Gordon Segal and his wife Carol were definitely not

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
We got married in the

33
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
The summer of 61

34
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,576
Now for a wedding gifts we really didn't get any of those kinds of things we loved me

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Weed shop the department stores and see beautiful.

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,256
Designs of the new Danish looking whatever and none of our relatives

37
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
Had the money or tastes too

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Tobias Wolff kind of wedding gift

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
So you just figured we just can't afford that so

40
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Yeah so let's move on

41
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
That's

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
That's right

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
So we got married in

44
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
Like I say in June of 61 and we went on our honeymoon to

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
The Caribbean

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
And then the Caribbean we noticed

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
There were some really nice stores

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
There was one Scandinavian store in the Virgin Islands

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,976
My wife picked up some of the items in the set how can you have Danish 18/8 stainless

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
295 a place setting

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
It's so much more expensive than American

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Danish Merchant there set

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
We have salesman from Europe come here and we buy direct from fact

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
And the very essence of their time and stuck in our minds as we bought a whole bunch of things

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
We got picked

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Car going

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
I was in a real estate business

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Teaching school we were both sort of bored

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
And then about in February of 62 on that I was washing dishes and I was

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,440
These dishes we had bought acid in Tokyo

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
They had to be other young people like ourselves with good taste and no money we should open a store

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
And what did Carol

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Well

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
She looked at me

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Sort of like I was crazy I said no no I mean it

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
We should hopeless

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
And you were young you guys were like what

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
When we were 23

69
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
And you just start

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
You know what we're about these beautiful things he's plates

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Turn end

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,040
Cookware at the store in the Caribbean and if they can do it white white why not sell it in the US

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Exactly

74
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
That's right

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,952
What is it like what gave you the confidence that you could pull off running a business

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Because you know

77
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
We'd grown up

78
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Her family had actually been in the retail business

79
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Apparel

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
We're both very good at selling

81
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
My family been the restaurant biz

82
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
And all of those businesses

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
It's all about service

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
It's all about self

85
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
And innocence my freedom I grew up with an immigrant

86
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Father-in-law

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
And the whole family on busy days had to work in the restaurant

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
So there was this background that we both have

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
And was we loved

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Beautiful things

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
Obviously the motivation of going into business with

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,815
Find beautiful things for other young people

93
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
But if we could buy things from Europe

94
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Directly

95
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,751
And just mark them up normally is if you bought them domestically not take a big margin

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
We could offer

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
Dramatically better pricing at Moore unique products

98
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
You know that people have never seen before

99
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
So how did you even start

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
We thought about it

101
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,647
And visit a trade Commissioners and we finally had all sorts of factor

102
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Free reference

103
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Search train

104
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
You want to Trade Commission had you

105
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
Glad you find Danish government would have a trade commissioner in every major

106
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
Intercity the Swedish government with we went to like their offices in Chicago and you anywhere like

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Hey we want to open up the

108
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
Danish shopping can we play can we talk to you that's right

109
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
That's exact

110
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Wow they had books about

111
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Do you know factories in Europe

112
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
But that made

113
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Specific items

114
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Light glassware

115
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
And they refer to still some people we might want to visit

116
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
And gave us names of fact

117
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Then we start

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
You know where we going to find a retail space

119
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
When we were driving around looking for anything

120
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
And finally it's so help my father man

121
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Until us there was an area

122
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
WellStar

123
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Street Northwest

124
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,567
Whatever is an old dumbwaiter Factory that was actually moving

125
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
And I'm I rented a space for 3 years for $350 a month

126
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,207
I mean after you visited these tradewraps and you decide okay we're going to open a shop

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
How did you come up with the cash to do it did you have any

128
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
Did you guys have any money

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Well we had

130
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
Saved made a little money as wedding gifts

131
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
So weird about $10,000

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
And we figured what we really need 25

133
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,687
And I spent six months running around to everyone I knew had any wealth

134
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Offering them half the business

135
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
House for $10,000

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,903
There was no such thing as venture-capital in those days there's no such things as start-up so those days

137
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Yeah I literally couldn't find anyone who to invest 10000

138
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
You could have bought half

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,863
Crate barrel four ten thousand bucks in like 1963 that's right

140
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,215
The end of the day the only person who gave us the money was my father

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
I can't let the $7,000

142
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Probably all the money he have in cash

143
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Slough

144
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Do you have 17000

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Which of course I'm assuming you need to like

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Order stuff

147
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
To sell rice

148
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,391
So we needed $10,000 for inventory and we only had $7,000

149
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
For rough

150
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
To build a store

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
And consequently

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
We had to come up with a clever way in

153
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Taking this dirty old elevator fat

154
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
History and turning it into a

155
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Scandinavian feeling

156
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Place

157
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,823
In the walls wall torn up and damaged then we couldn't afford someone a sheetrock

158
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Soap

159
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
We went out and found a lumber yard we found creating Lumber which we knocked up vertically on the walls and cover the walls

160
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
We literally did it I said

161
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Identify the stuff that you eat

162
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
You wanted to sell me

163
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Did you just

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Go to the catalogs

165
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
That's right

166
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Peach Factoria glasspack

167
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Free weather app

168
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Maybe an inch and a half

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
2 inch catalog

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Red ceramic

171
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Whatever

172
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
And we were just ordering from these catalogs

173
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
And having them ship the stuff

174
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Maybe weird

175
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Ford dinnerware patterns

176
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
We had

177
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
A very narrow selection of merchandise we only had ten thousand

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
And what like you were just like

179
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Huge crates

180
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
Stop delivered like shipt yuan Chicago and

181
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
And you won't even open yet

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Still not open

183
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
It opened

184
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
7th Ave

185
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
The December

186
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Of a 19-6

187
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
52 but

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:05,375
It took a we didn't get into the space till like November 15th we only had about three weeks

189
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
So you were like

190
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
Hammering boards to the wall hanging

191
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Sisters

192
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Ordering a sign

193
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
Were you working all night we worked

194
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
From early in the morning till late every night

195
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Andam

196
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
We were just

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Enthusiastic

198
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
The value of being very young

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
Is you have a lot of energy and passion and no wisdom

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
And so being that young was a great advantage and we were heading

201
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
No Children lyrics

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
23 we had all the energy in the world

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Because we had no money

204
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Pictures

205
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
We've basically

206
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Lake turned over the packing crates

207
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
The merchandiser

208
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
We came up with a way of stacking we found a

209
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,895
Some importer with some more uniform crates with some big barrels full of China

210
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
And about two weeks

211
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
4

212
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
We would open

213
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
We still don't have a name

214
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
And a friend of ours walked in

215
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Looked around the

216
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,951
I remember I was in the basement doing some paperwork and my wife came

217
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Down and said

218
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
Our friends suggest we call this place barrel and crate but

219
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Gordon

220
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Maybe maybe we should call Crate & Barrel I think that's better

221
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
And the

222
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Approximately two weeks

223
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Before we open the store we named

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Name The Crate & Barrel

225
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
So

226
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Opening day what happened

227
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
PECO

228
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Who was the opening weekend and

229
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
This area called Old Town had developed

230
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
This over a decade the sort of wheat

231
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
The first week in December they called it the Christmas walk

232
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
And we open that Friday of the Christmas walk

233
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,023
And we forgot to buy a cash-rich

234
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
And so we actually use the cigar box

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,703
And it was until the following Monday or Tuesday that

236
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,543
Exit my father found an old old NCR cash register

237
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
The ones you used to have to crank up to open the

238
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
We have calculated that

239
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
We need to do about $100,000 to

240
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
To take out $100 a week to live on and their first Christmas we did $8,000 to your thinking

241
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,839
Well on our way to a $100,000 a year solutely goes 8 * 12 is 96

242
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah

243
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,983
But then January of 63 came along and we did $4,000 we got a little

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Beard length

245
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,847
February of 63 I remember is probably one of the snowiest months

246
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Chicago's history

247
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,527
And we have one day where we did $8 in the whole month was only $2,000 home and so are you freaking out

248
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,903
We were very scared that we would lose my father's money in their savings but you know what

249
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
When you're young you know you could start over

250
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,607
Slowly that spring came around Old Town became more popular they put gas lights up on the street

251
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,215
And people say what did you see that counterculture store down a well Street

252
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
They're selling nice things out of crates and barrels

253
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
And it was nice

254
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
And we ended up

255
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Because you didn't know how to

256
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Price merchandising

257
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
About half the product we sold we sold

258
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
You were selling the product at cost

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Yeah

260
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
So not only where we importing it directly

261
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,743
The fact that we didn't know what we're doing and we're mispricing number tonight is also made it even more exciting

262
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
How did that happen

263
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
We had some major vendors who hadn't gotten us a proper invoice

264
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
So we're just guessing the price

265
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
We were guessing the price

266
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
In our customers loved

It's how I built this

306
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
From NPR

307
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Gyros

Filter retailer

Crate & Barrel

311
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
So it's

312
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
The business card took off pretty quickly

313
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Even though you had some tough months it kind of took off

314
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Well the first you would get a hundred thousand

315
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Do we did end up at the end of the year doing a hunter

316
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
How's the second year 200

317
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
225

318
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
The third-year 300000

319
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
What was it like that in those early days it was that was making you guys successfully

320
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Did you did you have that

321
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Can I create a market

322
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
For for the staff are or the people just come in and say this is cool is bias

323
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
Well what happened was we were very fortunate

324
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
1

325
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
America was then getting wealthier in the early 67

326
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
Toot It was a lady named Julia Child's that came along and made cooking fish

327
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Fashionable

328
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
3 jet travel

329
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Especially Yours

330
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
MN many more people would doing it these events

331
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Started all of a sudden

332
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,783
Making people aware of French cooking yeah there's a big difference in the way

333
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
You know they looked at dining in

334
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Food was very important chefs

335
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Important

336
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
American those days

337
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Cooking wasn't sure it wasn't something people

338
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
Love to do and dining and serving in the dinner table

339
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
You know but

340
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
I remember in Chicago in the early sixties we had maybe three good restaurants

341
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,335
Boston I remember Craig Claiborne was once a ass when he was up in Boston where do you

342
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
But he was a food critic

343
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
Where did where did where do you go when you want a good meal uses

344
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,295
I go to the airport and I get on the first flight to New York

345
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,439
So it's hard to believe that the map is Boston in Chicago. Great restaurant

346
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,535
Because people now there's a major food culture and dining culture

347
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
15th exist when we were

348
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
And did you

349
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
I read that at a certain point you and Carol

350
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Decided that

351
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Instead of like

352
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
Just ordering from catalogs that you should actually go to Europe and

353
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Visit factories

354
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
That's right

355
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
The first year in 1963 our first

356
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
School year in business we didn't have time to go to

357
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
1964 went to Europe

358
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
4/3 weeks

359
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
By then we had two or three staff members

360
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
We left the company

361
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
I need them

362
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,511
And we went and we traveled all over Europe

363
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Who started in Belgium

364
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
Found a great class Factory we went to

365
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,959
The German trade fairs in Cologne and Frankfurt and found all sorts of Interest

366
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Products

367
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
It was incredible nothing like that again

368
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
We spent a lot of time

369
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
Walking the streets and sing special stores

370
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,039
Looking at stores and seeing what were they doing in Europe why were we so excited

371
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
What was it was the visual.

372
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
Play it was the way to use color it was the way they did the storefront was the way they did their lighting

373
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
And we became students of retail

374
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
And Carol by the way

375
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Company never will

376
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Conceited without her

377
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Effort she was not only talented

378
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Helping select products

379
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
She was very talented Edition

380
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,663
And we're both very good at selling so when you were in Europe were there any

381
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Like what

382
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Mid 20s

383
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
Did you ever have a situation where these Factory owners go to YouTube

384
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Who are you you know

385
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
Bright like that there were many people had doubts but

386
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Rihanna we have letters of credit we had

387
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,143
Ability to buy we found us an agent Sweden who is the new a lot of people who helped us

388
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Introduce

389
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Factories

390
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,519
And I don't believe in

391
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
Are we met tour banasco up in Copenhagen who

392
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,711
Introduce the store marimekko and introduced to us a lot of Danish factories

393
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
He sold us beautiful

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
Product also wouldn't things

395
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
Textiles

396
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Leather goods

397
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,999
This guy influenced Our Lives seeing his wife we remain friends for the next 50 years

398
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
So how did you guys start to like a really grow the business

399
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Because you didn't have it outside

400
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
We never had outside investor

401
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Matilda

402
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Many years later

403
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
So how are you guys able to expand without

404
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Any outside money

405
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
Well we basically knows they should go to a bank in your borrow money

406
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
I remember our first home was $10,000

407
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
The second loan was 25000

408
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
When we open the store and 65

409
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
68

410
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
You still at only one store we're doing $500,000

411
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,143
Which like today is like a little store doing $2000000

412
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
So when you guys decided to

413
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
2 to open that second

414
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Install

415
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
1968 is that right

416
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Right so then you got

417
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
A bank loan and then where you were

418
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
And I guess you were betting the company right because

419
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Yuan with that leverage of the SEC

420
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Score fail the whole thing would go under

421
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
Every store we open between are opening in

422
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
62 Oxford

423
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
Buildstore and 65r Plaza De Lago

424
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Gemstone 68

425
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,887
Are Oakbrook store in 71 every time was betting the company every time

426
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Every time

427
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
And every time we knew if we failed the

428
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
The company might

429
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Go down

430
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,615
And then the 1975 we got the opportunity open our first Michigan Avenue

431
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Hyundai

432
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,247
If we fail here that would certainly Twitter invest a lot of money

433
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Take a big risk

434
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
But that store opened in 1975

435
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
And

436
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
After 3 months we knew was very

437
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Successful

438
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
And from then on

439
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
The pressure was a lot less than it wasn't better company because by then

440
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
You know if we were doing enough volume and creating enough profits

441
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
So we didn't want partners

442
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
We didn't want investors

443
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
Why not well because we felt they would have different motivation

444
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
We love being mortal

445
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
We love talking to customers loved inspiring staff

446
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
And we love searching for the product

447
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
Our goal wasn't to build a chain store

448
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
Our goal was to

449
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Find the best merchandise

450
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
The best price

451
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
It would excite our customers

452
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Imp

453
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
Exciter staff about what we were doing

454
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
I was reading about

455
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,351
About the expansion of company and I guess it took like

456
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,703
25 years for you guys to go from one store 217 stores

457
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
Right which was in 1985 who wrote then

458
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
But then by like 1995 you had expanded to 60 store so what what happened why did you guys were

459
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Why did you decide to

460
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
To grow so much faster

461
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,831
Well we reached a different era where it was important to have scale

462
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
To do the things we had to do with buying merchandise

463
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,511
So you had a guarantee to a factory used by a certain amount of

464
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
A product

465
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
To make sure we were the only people in the Senate

466
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
States that would be carrying it

467
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
And you began to sense that you needed scale to

468
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
That's what we started doing

469
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
1990 rebuilt of flags

470
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Ship store in Chicago

471
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,175
Which really helped launch our expansion because then

472
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,015
Every landlord every shopping mall one of the Crate & Barrel build

473
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
And we were a big attraction cuz we drew in a lot of customers

474
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,695
And what happened starting in that big expansion was landlord started

475
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
Paying for a lot of the build out of the store

476
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Building of the building and whatever

477
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
So we didn't have to take

478
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
This much of our Financial Risk ourselves

479
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Does the landlord's built

480
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
The store has a lot of these.

481
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
So sounds like things were going pretty well for you

482
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Without

483
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Having any outside investors

484
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
So what what made you decide to

485
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Eventually

486
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Bringing outside money

487
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,343
What was your thinking when you made that decision

488
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Hyatt

489
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
Thought by the time I was 65

490
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
I was thinking about 60 I

491
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
I thought I'd probably want to retire

492
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
And some

493
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Intelligent guy said you know

494
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
You're going to you no sell your business to it 5 years

495
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
Before you retire so you can help them

496
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
The transition and whatever

497
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
And

498
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Now you own the responsibility to both my

499
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
My family into my staff

500
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
You make sure the company was well finans than

501
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
Could take risks and could go through trauma

502
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
And survive

503
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
And I also realized that at that time to company was

504
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Relatively very strong of retail

505
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,280
The relatively weak indirect marketing which at those days was cattle

506
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
Cadillac yeah

507
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
We've actually spent a year-and-a-half

508
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
Looking around the world for a partner

509
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,752
And we finally found out of the Auto Group

510
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
In Hamburg Germany

511
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
And they were

512
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Second largest

513
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
Mail-order company in Europe

514
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Today either

515
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
After Amazon there's a big

516
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Just internet come

517
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
In the world

518
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
And the 98 we sold them about two-thirds of the

519
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Company

520
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
And I'm

521
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
10 years later the contract was

522
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Poems for 10 years

523
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,840
We sold them the the rest of the third ISO 98 you agree

524
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Stay on for

525
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Affixed maritime

526
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Continue run the company

527
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Exact

528
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Their basic

529
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Chick-fil-A Worcester choir

530
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
Businesses like ours and let the management continue running

531
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
In our success was we trip

532
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
The size of a company

533
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
When troubled

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
The profits of a company

535
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,320
And we were able to grow but more important

536
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,672
Stay after we with him a year to the said you got to really look into this internet

537
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Then what was it 99 mm

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
Who said what's the internet and then they started telling us

539
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
And early and then we started developing our

540
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Internet business which today

541
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Represents about 38

542
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
Percent of all the sales at Crate & Barrel

543
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
And the customers buy it

544
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Normal amount of furniture

545
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
Which is hard for me to believe

546
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
So when you

547
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
You stepped down was that

548
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Built

549
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Well of course it's hard

550
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Beano

551
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
I didn't realize that have that much energy left

552
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
70 but I've enormous energy but the last

553
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
To three years I've been

554
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,936
Doing things in our family office of finding new Young.

555
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Nurse week

556
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,848
When I advise young people today I said look at the job and say you going to love it

557
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
And it's going to be something you can devote your life to

558
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
And work 10-12 hours a day and works

559
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
6 7 days a week

560
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
I mean

561
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
Then you'll be a success

562
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
But don't go to do something cuz of

563
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Apus salary or

564
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Title

565
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
And I think that's the thing we picked up from the European

566
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Friends of ours who

567
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,072
You know have a different pace of life in a different Focus

568
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
You know that's how it should be

569
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
I want to make a lot of money how do I do it it's

570
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
What do I love to do and if I do it really good

571
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Then we will make

572
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Money

573
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
How much of

574
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Your success to yuan

575
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
U2

576
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Just

577
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Jarrett Allen

578
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
And you're

579
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Smarts

580
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Your hard work and how much do you accrue

581
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Well

582
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
The lucky part was our timing

583
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
It was just

584
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Set the appropriate time to

585
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Going to Europe to find new contemporary

586
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Designing

587
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Tabletop

588
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
The furniture nest

589
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
I think it was

590
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
The talent of

591
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
Attracting people and making them feel like

592
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
We were all in it together

593
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
That I didn't realize I had nor did I

594
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Pitbull eyes I was good at

595
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
For many many years but I was

596
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
And I think that had a lot to do

597
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
I was lucky to be married to Carole Segal who had the

598
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
This enormous Talent

599
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
You know we started out too

600
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,904
Create something that was going to be different and beautiful and wonderful

601
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
This is still in the culture that company yuan

602
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Great depth

603
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
They're still doing very well

604
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,960
Ever have imagined like when you open up this thing in Chicago in a disused elevator Factory with

605
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Boards that you hammered into the walls

606
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
This company will be doing sales of

607
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
What are Cracker Barrel's hours today

608
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
About 1.2 billion

609
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
That we went from one employer to another 7000

610
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
Could you ever have imagined that

611
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Never never ever

612
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,160
We never plan we had no ambition to do that

613
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
We just had ambition to love what we are doing

614
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
I still have

615
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Someone I graduate college and lose my first

616
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Department

617
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
My mom bought me

618
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Set of

619
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Flat white

620
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
Crate & Barrel

621
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Dinner plates

622
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
They were they were made in Japan at the time

623
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Time I still have

624
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
Sub serve dinner on them

625
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,432
Well that's our problem you replace cars every 2-3 years you have dinnerware for

626
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
20 years

627
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
You know

628
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,320
People tell me they have product they bought in the 60s and 70s

629
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
And I Winspear

630
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
Gordon Segal officially step down as CEO crate Barrel in 2008

631
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
But two years ago the company if she brought him back to help out during kind of a rough patch Gordon

632
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Safer year things be a more stable now he's doing mainly philanthropic work in and around Chicago

633
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
Oh and in a few months Gordon and Carol will celebrate 56 years of marriage

634
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
And please don't turn it off

635
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Yet in a moment

636
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
We're going to hear from you about the things

637
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
You guys are building

638
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors

639
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Cleveland Clinic

00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,752
Cleveland Clinic is ranked number one in the nation

641
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520

Clevelandclinic.org

646
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Heart Care

647
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Hey thanks for sticking around because now it's time for how you built that and here's the story we got from allicattt

648
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,072
Avedisian who kind of stumbled on his idea few years ago when he was just out of college

649
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
He was working an

650
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Surfing

651
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
In a fishing Village

652
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
In El Salvador

653
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,544
And one of my friends that was living in the community actually showed me the roofing

654
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Haunted homes

655
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
It was colorful and bright

656
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:02,272
And so it made us just look at it again. I think that's a billboard and it was the roof was made from part of a bill

657
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Billboard that

658
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
You'd see on the side of any road

659
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
And I was thinking

660
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
How could that

661
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Working

662
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Billboards

663
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
Paper right that that roof is going to

664
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
Fall apart in a day

665
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
But then he started to do a little research

666
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
And I was like what

667
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,448
And no I didn't know the Billboards were made of PVCs what's a heavy-duty vinyl

668
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Material cell

669
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
Directly UV protected

670
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Waterproof

671
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,176
Southern Roofing and durable enough to last me to keep the water out then they could definitely

672
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
Turn into some sort of product

673
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,784
Alex figured all of that bright heavy vinyl

674
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,880
Can be made into really strong duffle bags and backpacks and things like that

675
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:44,256
So after you left El Salvador and move to Southern California heat started

676
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Make a few calls

677
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
I didn't know anything about billboard companies

678
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,448
But I just started calling and once I told him hey you know I think I can save you guys some money

679
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
Can I have a few of them

680
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,592
Basic yeah sure that the ad companies were happy because they didn't have to pay to

681
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,408
Dump the vinyl in a landfill and Alec was happy

682
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Because it didn't cost a lot to get the stuff

683
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
Pretty much the cost of shipping

684
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,088
And we had his very first sheet of vinyl to cut up

685
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
He designed something he actually knows something about

686
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
I carry bag for

687
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Is surfboard

688
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,072
I figured a surf bag is like a pancake there's only two sides to it so I'll be the easiest thing to make

689
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Let's start with that

690
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
But it took him a while to figure out how

691
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Actually get it made

692
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
So my first bag I took to a car upholstery manufacturer

693
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
Try to know anybody that did sewing

694
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
And that first bag actually looked

695
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
Good enough for Alex have one leg more

696
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:38,272
So fast forward a couple months and Alex start selling these surf bags in sport shops

697
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Around La

698
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112

00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,048
From one billboard we can get upwards of 150 backpacks and probably around a thousand phone covers

701
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
At least

702
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Every one of the products is unique

703
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,192
Different shapes different splash of color because

704
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,752
Each item is cut from a different part of the

705
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Cheyenne Highway advertisement

706
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568

The company just started to turn a profit

717
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168

718
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,032
