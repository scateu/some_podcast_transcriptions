12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
Special and

13
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272

Even though I interview them almost

18
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,768
A year ago I'm still kind of obsessed with the story because

19
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
It's about a guy who built

20
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Huge business

21
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376

Enjoy it

25
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
I was learning much more running a business on the streets versus studying in school

26
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
I remember sitting down with my father who's a liver transplant surgeon but I remember having to sit down to him and just say Dad

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Got some good news for you is good news cuz to me it was good news and I thought if I could

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
You getting excited he might agree with me and I told him I was leaving school he said you're dropping out of school to become a judge

From NPR

00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776

Stories behind the movements they built

00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm Gyros and old pickup truck and a simple

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Idea inspired Brian scudamore to build the largest junk hauling service in the world

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
By this point if you've been listening to the show

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
You know all about the ins

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
Firing people who had an idea

38
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
And then ran with it

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Whether it was Sara Blakely

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992

Zappos

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
They had a vision in the pursuit

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
But almost all of them

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
They had to go through a complicated process to get from idea to implementation

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Which is why today story

47
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Is such a contrast because

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
Well junk hauling not sound sexy

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
Brian scudamore's idea was comparatively elegant and simple

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
He didn't need a whole lot of money to start

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
He didn't need any outside investors

52
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
And he didn't need to hire any

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
At least at first

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
And to be clear Brian did not

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Dream of a life hauling away other people

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Trash

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
But he did dream of starting a business

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
Even as a kid

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
In Vancouver Canada

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Etsy seventh grade

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
I remember in Vancouver

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
Starting a car wash one summer

63
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,960
I saw my neighbor across the street Eric and started this car wash

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
And he was charging

65
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
3 box of car

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
And I thought wow what a great way to make money I saw him washing cars and making money so I went and took a piece of plywood made my own song

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
And I decided to charge 2 Box how you undercut your

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Libra Casa 3

69
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
I undercut my neighbor by a full dollar

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
And I thought

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
This is cool

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,536
And there I was learning about a price war and it was awesome because

73
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,632
Literally cars would show up on my side of the street I'd wash their cars

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
You get more cars we start competing on price

75
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
So the funny part is I got down to $0.65 you were a ruthless cruel

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Heartless businessman in 7th grade

77
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,016
You know it's funny we've both made money we both had fun and we would do this

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Several times throughout the summer

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
And weed weed up the marketing so I

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Get some friends you know a couple of girls that were in my class and

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
I get them to go hold signs at the busier Street a block away to flag people over and

82
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
You start to learn about

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Pricing and profit

84
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
And I was making so much money that I just I couldn't even believe it

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Would you like a

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Genius student like where you super

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Go to school

88
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,712
Whatever the polar opposite of Genius student would be would be who I was

89
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
What would happen if things like reading night

90
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
I just that was one area I got stuck

91
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
I am so add that I

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
I couldn't focus on the words

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
My mind would go to other things and I

94
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
I would have a hard time with that

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
So I learned to read but I didn't learn to understand

96
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
And that became a challenge through school and

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Andrea Lee

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Serta help me back

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
From from learning through book

100
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
So

101
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
I

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Failed

103
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Many years throughout High School

104
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
I ultimately was one course short from finishing High School

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
So 12th grade

106
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Didn't finish

107
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Didn't graduate

108
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
But then I

109
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
It's all my friends every single one of them get accepted into colleges

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
And I said I don't want to be left out

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
So I went to one of the universities

112
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
And said I don't have

113
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
My high school graduation

114
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
I'm smart enough I can do this

115
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
I wrote them letters and I

116
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Spent time

117
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Any admissions office and finally they said

118
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Okay

119
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
We're going to let you in

120
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
So you were

121
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
So you were about 18 I guess

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
At the time we were you working like

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Your parents helping you out how did you even have money to go to school

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
My parents

125
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
When I approach them and ask

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
For some money for

127
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
For school they said you kidding me you didn't even finish High School why are we going to find your college education

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
Turns out they were probably smart but what it taught me is I had to get out there

129
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
Fund my own education

130
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
And what I did was I was in a McDonald's drive-thru

131
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,775
In Vancouver I saw this beat up old pickup truck plywood sides junk filled up in the truck

132
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
And had to sign on the box that said Mark salling

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
I was having trouble finding a job I didn't know what I was going to do to pay for college

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And when I saw that truck

135
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
I immediately connected with that something I can do

136
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
I looked at the truck and I thought

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
I started those car washes as a

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
The kid

139
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,047
You can see how easy that was to get out there and advertising

140
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Wash people's cars

141
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
And so to me this was

142
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Buy truck and haul junk

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Why should you be like rush out and go

144
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Woodford Rye

145
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Yeah grab the classified

146
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Section of the paper

147
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
It started looking for trucks

148
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
And I found one that I

149
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
Google 5000 love with it but I certainly could afford

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
It's price tag of $700

151
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
Add $1,000 of my own money

152
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,463
And I spent $700 on a beat up truck of my own and it was this little

153
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Blue Ford F100

154
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
And I got my

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,911
Girlfriend's father at the time to help me build plywood sides on there and

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
If I went I spray-painted 738 junk which was the phone number I was able to get from the phone company

157
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,151
Has my phone number and my company was called the rubbish boys

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
You know light bulb moment we are

159
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
Care about them but the reality is there.

160
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Many lipomas usually

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Long processing

162
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Iterations and trying things and failing in life

163
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
This was a lightbulb moment that just

164
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Happened to pass by you at that moment at the McDonald's

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
You would not have seen that truck and you may not have

166
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
I thought of that idea absolutely true but I would have found something else

167
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
It's in my DNA

168
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
How I think

169
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
And so sure

170
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Found a junk truck

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,199
Hey I'm not passionate about junk I never will be but I love customers

172
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Experience and I love building

173
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
Businesses I love building things

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
So I didn't see the junk truck I could have seen

175
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Completely different I could have seen a carpet cleaning business and said hey

176
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
That's what I'm going out

177
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
So you two you go out you get the

178
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
And how did you even know what to do with

179
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Even know what to charge

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Or or or anything

181
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
DIYs I just started looking around in the classifieds

182
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
I started looking and going okay

183
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
There's other people

184
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Doing what they called rubbish removal

185
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,527
And they say they charge by the truckload of the portion of a load

186
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
I called them up and find out how much they charge.

187
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
You call someone out and you say I've got a couch they're going to tell you

188
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
Anthony hundred box hundred fifty bucks dumping fees whatever it would be

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
And I would pay attention and

190
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Make notes

191
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
And then I decided I started my my charge rate at

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
$80

193
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Truckload

194
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Which is pretty

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
Yeah it was pretty cheap but it was it was probably too cheap

196
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Because

197
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,663
In the beginning I wasn't really making money I underpriced myself thinking

198
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,783
When you go out as a business specially as an 18 year old kid starting to company

199
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
How to be the cheapest

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
How are you getting the word out I mean

201
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
How did people know that you were even

202
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Available to do this

203
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
So I painted my phone over on the side of my truck

204
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,655
738 junk it was just emblazoned on their was bigger than anything else you could possibly see

205
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
And I would park my truck

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
It at a high-traffic intersection

207
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
It so people would see this and then call

208
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
And I really quickly

209
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
I figured out that people tell I saw your your 78 junk truck parked at

210
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Arbutus and 12th how much you guys charge

211
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,135
And so I I learned very quickly that that was my mobile billboard

212
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
And what would you do you go to a house and

213
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Youku

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Yourself no help

215
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
We are all the

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
The stuff that they wanted removed

217
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Iwata

218
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Just go into their attic to basement wherever the junk was in the garage and

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
You haul it away

220
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,823
But I realize there's a lot of things like refrigerators and deep freezers that were too heavy

221
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
For just myself Seattle

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
I need employees

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
And I recruited my best friend David snyderman

224
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,599
He became too connected to the junk I mean we're still best friends today but it was pretty funny because

225
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
He would just look through the junk and go

226
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Look at that

227
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
Check this out you know the history behind the city would keep things and I'm like

228
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
She's not going to work out we need to work here

229
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
So how did you figure out

230
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
What do you do with John

231
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Like because

232
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Cuz you have to

233
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Paof

234
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
BMC Metallica

235
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Site like a landfill site where did you

236
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Where'd you find

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
The best places

238
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
I called up the city the municipalities and they said

239
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
Where do I take a load of junk if I've got something

240
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,343
They gave me the addresses of all the different places and

241
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:06,975
I tried them all out somewhere we're closer than others somewhere cheaper but farther away

242
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Experimented a bit but

243
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
Pretty easy stuff I made it really was a business of

244
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Pick up someone's John

245
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
See the smile on their face

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
Take their stuff off to the dump or to be recycled

247
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
And repeat

248
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
So simple how how how long does it take before

249
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Are you actually

250
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
You know you paid up

251
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
So within two weeks I've made enough money that a

252
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Paid for the business

253
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
Adjusted my prices quickly I worked hard

254
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
And I made $1,700

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Net profit

256
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,791
That summer 1989 roughly 1989

257
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
All I remember was that $1,700 was enough to pay for my school

258
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
And some leftover

259
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
And I would do this every summer

260
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Until I finally

261
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
Have the Bold decision to drop out

262
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
I was learning much more

263
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,551
Running a business on the streets versus studying in school and I remember sitting down with my father who's a liver transplant surgeon

264
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
This guy's done more school than anybody I know and very successful very smart man

265
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
But I remember having to sit down to him and just say Dad

266
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Got some good news for you and I presented it as is good news cuz to me it was good news and I thought if I could get him excited he might agree

267
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
Agree with me and I told him I was leaving school

268
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,871
Since you're dropping out of school to become a junk man I mean he was just

269
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Destroyed

270
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
My oldest son is leaving school to become a junkman and then I said

271
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
On the glamour Spectrum I mean it couldn't be

272
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Closer to the bottom

273
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,327
And I just said no Dad I'm learning so much more he said you know bright you got a year left in your University education

274
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Just go finish it

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
I said Dad

276
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
My business opportunity might not be there

277
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Forever

278
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,127
I said I guarantee the University of British Columbia will be there for years and years to come if I ever choose to go back

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
So we agreed to disagree and

280
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
I dropped out

281
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
At this point this became your your full-time

282
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Get right look at this point

283
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
You and visit you in a partner overseas

284
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Just you alone

285
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
So when I dropped out

286
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
I ended up having a

287
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
A guy went to school with me

288
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
John

289
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
And John Redal and I

290
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
We went from one truck

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
The three trucks

292
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Right after I

293
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Quit school

294
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,311
And whole thinking there was these mobile Billboards work

295
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
If I can add

296
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Two or three mobile Billboards around town we're going to get that

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
Busier and things are going to grow when we're going to have this

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Empire

299
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
You weren't even paying for advertising cuz you just had

300
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
We weren't paying for advertising and

301
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
My girlfriend at the time said

302
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,791
Why don't you call up the local press call the newspaper and tell them

303
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Your story

304
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
So what story

305
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
And she said well that you guys have created your own job it's a tight summer

306
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Labor market nobody can find work

307
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
You guys

308
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Created your own job and I said okay

309
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
I picked up the phone

310
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,431
And I called up the Vancouver Province our biggest newspaper at the time

311
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
It must have been a slow news day because

312
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,135
I said I got a great story for you and they said what is it and I told them and they sent a reporter and they sent that a photographer

313
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
And the next day boom We are on the front page

314
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Of the paper

315
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
We got a front page ad for free

316
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
With your phone number on it

317
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
Yeah and I remember the photographer saying

318
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
You guys are going to be busy tomorrow

319
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
And sure enough he was right we had bus drivers driving down the streets

320
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
Waving their newspapers with our picture on it

321
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Out of the window going out to you

322
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
And that was pretty fun

323
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,527
By the way did you ever have to get a bank loan or or

324
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Outside money

325
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
E225

326
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
I didn't I was lucky I

327
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
Built a business out of cash flow

328
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
And it was in your cost for lowrider

329
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Was you and your partner and you were just hauling the stuff out

330
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,679
Yeah and I ultimately bought my partner out after about a year

331
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,031
And what I did is I just invested everything back into the business to grow it

332
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
But I never expanded beyond my means

333
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Not in the early stages

334
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
What's the kind of stuff that died

335
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
U-Haul out of people's homes

336
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
We would haul away old furniture

337
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Appliances

338
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
We're very much a

339
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Keep up with the Joneses type world and I think

340
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,815
Unfortunately people renovate too much and always want new furniture and the latest and greatest

341
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Some TVs and sell

342
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
We haul away their old stuff we try and recycle as much as

343
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
As we possibly can but

344
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Furniture appliances yard debris when someone cleans up the yard

345
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
And it was a simple model but it was

346
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
It was fun because you would find weird things

347
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
I remember there was a woman who

348
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,319
Had Soup cans should a whole wall of Campbell Soup cans I made it look like a real life

349
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Art piece

350
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,951
Write and edit remember you know looking at this and going

351
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
What are you doing in jail she just said well

352
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,143
If she was saving up for the next big war and then just wanted to have all this food stocked away and

353
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Finally her kids to said like

354
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
And even if there was a war you couldn't eat that stuff it snow

355
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
50 years old so

356
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,383
We ended up cleaning out a whole wall OU Andy Warhol ish

357
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Wallace

358
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Campbell Soup cans

359
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
What were some of the challenges that you

360
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Effaced

361
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Were there any eat like

362
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Regulations that you had to get around or

363
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Competitors that tried to

364
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
You know shut you down or anything like that

365
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
The biggest

366
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,375
Challenge I faced in the early days five years and we are about a half a million in Revenue

367
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
And I realized I wasn't having fun any longer

368
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
I was avoiding spending time with my employees

369
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Nigist

370
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,383
Have the wrong people and I realize that One Bad Apple spoils the whole bunch and

371
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
I had nine of my 11 staff were bad apples

372
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
I just decided to clean house and I

373
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
I got rid of everybody and I did it in one sitting

374
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,719
I took responsibility as their leader and said he had let you guys down and I'm sorry but

375
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
This isn't going to work out

376
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
What was the

377
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Problem with him

378
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
They weren't clean-cut they weren't professional they didn't see what I saw and it was as simple as

379
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
I don't care about the cost

380
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
They were hauling away the junk

381
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Taking it to the dump

382
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
They didn't have the sense of lips

383
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
Allow the customer to have that sense of relief

384
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Their junk is gone that they

385
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
It got there space back

386
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
Let's chat them up a little bit and make them happy

387
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
And

388
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
They weren't aligned with

389
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
My vision

390
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
How are you able to

391
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
Like how he able to run the business the next day all the sudden

392
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Fired your entire team

393
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
And presumably you had Jabs

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
To do the next day in

395
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
That was hard I went from five trucks down to

396
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
The ability to only run one at a time

397
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,199
And so I have my truck I had my cell phone I was the call center I did the booking the dispatch

398
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
The junk hauling I did everything

399
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
But what it taught me was

400
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
PE build a company that's all about people find the right people and treat people right so I got out from that day

401
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
To never make

402
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,071
The same mistake of course I've made hiring mistakes but

403
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
Relatively few

404
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
I really focused on finding people that I wanted to work with

405
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
When we come back out Brian scudamore pleaded with the state of Idaho to get the number one

435
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

436
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
A guy Roz

437
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
It's the mid-1990s

438
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Brian has

439
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Fired all of his employees

440
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
And after a rough

441
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Few months

442
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
He begins to rebuild the team

443
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
But at this point

444
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
His company is

445
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Still a small business

446
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Running injuries

447
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
One city

448
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,647
When did you decide that you know it's going to be bigger than just like a

449
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Junk Hauling Company in Vancouver

450
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
So you know what that this point 1997 we are actually two million dollars in revenue and I joined something called

451
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
Yeo the young entrepreneurs organization

452
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,079
I found myself surrounded by people who had some pretty cool businesses

453
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Tech companies in

454
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,735
And growing ad agencies and just stuff that seemed a little sexier than junk removal

455
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,343
And so I think I found myself feeling sad because I was comparing myself to others

456
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
And I didn't feel good enough

457
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
So what I ended up doing was I

458
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
Went to my parents summer Cottage that this little cottage and I

459
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
I sat on their dock

460
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
I said okay this isn't who I am I'm an optimist

461
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
So I pulled out a pen and a sheet of paper

462
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
And I said okay what if I could just

463
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Dream up possible

464
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,663
What could this business look feel and act like 5 years down the road

465
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,527
And I said we'll be in the top 30 metros in North America even though we were only in one

466
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,647
We would be the FedEx of junk removal clean shiny trucks friendly uniform driver

467
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
I just started to put these

468
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
Big hairy audacious goals down on paper that we would

469
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,655
Be like the McDonald's of of junk that we would you know just what Ray Kroc did where you got all these owners on board

470
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,727
We would do the same thing with a junk removal business

471
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
And I took Paul guy who was the

472
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Operations manager of mine in Vancouver

473
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
And I said you're going back and forth

474
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Toronto

475
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Every couple of weeks to see your girlfriend

476
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Why don't you move there why don't you take a truck

477
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Why don't you start

478
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
The first franchise

479
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
How did you even notice structure

480
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
A franchise

481
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
You figure out how that would work

482
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,303
I looked at other franchises I looked at Subway I looked at businesses and thought

483
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
What kind of royalty are they charging

484
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
What what's the business model

485
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,263
I got out and talked to a bunch of experts so again being a guy that doesn't learn from school

486
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
Just picked up the phone and I called people I called

487
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
And I approached a bunch of expert

488
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,711
Person said this is what I'm thinking of doing what do you think

489
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
They gave me some feedback and advice on how to structure

490
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Fees and royalties

491
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
I brought on a franchise lawyer who still with us today

492
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
And I remember this

493
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
He helped to give me a lot of the advice in the systems

494
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
He believed in us and knew that we don't something

495
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
Much bigger than where it was at the

496
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
The time

497
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
So you get your

498
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
First franchisee in

499
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Toronto and

500
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
How old

501
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
How did it go

502
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,592
It was funny because I got a phone call from Paul guy so he

503
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
It took them I don't know week tickets

504
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
To Toronto you made a few stops

505
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
So he calls me up

506
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Within the first couple of weeks

507
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
And he said

508
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
This isn't going to work here

509
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Hello what are you talkin about Polly Sidwell

510
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
I found out that the city will haul away anything

511
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
For free

512
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
He said you can just put it out on the curb side that got special garbage collection days they'll take

513
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
Fridges stoves couches you name it it doesn't matter

514
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,728
I said Paul you've driven across the country trust me please just try it

515
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Until he did

516
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Any start to get business

517
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
And he started to hear from customers

518
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
That

519
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
You know someone was doing the renovation maybe they didn't get a city permit so they didn't want to call the city to haul away the junk or maybe the junk

520
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
What was in the garage or the basement

521
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
The city workers wouldn't come collect it from anywhere but the curbside

522
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
And Paul started to realize wow

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Okay this is going to work

524
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
You did a million dollars in Revenue

525
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
In this first full calendar year

526
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
So at that point you're thinking okay we've got to expand we've got to move Beyond Vancouver and Toronto

527
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,456
And what was the next step was next place to go next place to go was in the United States

528
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
At the beginning is called the rubbish boys when did you come up

529
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
Did you become 1-800

530
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
Paul was in my office we were working and I said

531
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,096
We're going to go for this franchise model and build something

532
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Across North America

533
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,704
I knew the word rubbish was going to be a problem

534
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
It was more of a Canadian British term

535
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,568
And the other problem we had was people would

536
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Either think of the company is being the rubbish boys and some people thought of us a 7 3/8 junk so effectively they saw us at 2

537
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
New companies

538
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
So I remember sitting down with Paul and we were

539
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
We are brainstorm meaning

540
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
I said what if we did a 1-800 number

541
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
Something like 1-800 Flowers something that was more descriptive

542
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:32,096
So we started brainstorming in the whole got milk campaign that was running at the time

543
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Inspired me to

544
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
1-800 got junk

545
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,056
And our phone number at a? In it and it would ask the question got junk

546
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Of course I do then give us a call and so

547
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:49,760
And so I try to find who owned 1-800 got junk

548
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
It wasn't available

549
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,880
The phone company said they couldn't get me the number so

550
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
How to dig around

551
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,816
I ended up making about 60 phone calls I had people friends and family in the United States calling the number

552
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
It was only working in one state

553
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
And that was the state of Idaho

554
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Kuna Idaho had this number

555
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
The Department of Transportation in Idaho own

556
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
This 1-800 got junk phone number

557
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,920
They didn't know it's spelled got Junk but they were using this phone number

558
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,784
And I thought okay I need this number so I called into their office

559
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,136
Called up there's main switchboard asked for the phone room and I got the sky Michael

560
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Michael ends up

561
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
You know talking to me anyway

562
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Does why do you want

563
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
The number and I just said it

564
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Business ideas I really want it

565
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
That's why we're not really using it that much

566
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
It took three phone calls to him before he finally said

567
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Okay here's the AT&T forums

568
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Fax them over to me

569
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
The number is yours

570
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
I signed and we had

571
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Ideal weight when he just gave you the

572
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
He gave you

573
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
The phone number for

574
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
I think he wanted to get rid of me I think he was sick and tired of me calling

575
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,416
But I mean you really needed that phone number in credibly Lucky break

576
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
It was a lucky break but you make your own luck I mean I could have given up after

577
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Call number 54

578
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
455 I just kept going and

579
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,264
I've heard so many stories of going to Colonel Sanders knocking on 183 doors and then the hundred and 84th

580
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
The guy goes yeah I love the recipe

581
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
And so

582
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Just can't give up

583
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
So how did you expand into the US

584
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
So we

585
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Expanded through franchising

586
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
We found a lawyer

587
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:33,184
Started networking for a Canadian lawyer found a great attorney in the US we created our franchise documentation

588
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
You got approved by the FTC in

589
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
I said okay

590
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Off you go

591
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,376
And then we just really started to aggressively go after the US press

592
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
The big turning point for us

593
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
But that the big media hit in the US with

594
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Fortune Magazine

595
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Why did you think it was so important to get

596
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Press coverage

597
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
I saw that

598
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,480
When we were this little local businesses the rubbish boys

599
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
And we would get stories in the newspaper

600
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
People would repeat our stories back to us

601
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Like wow

602
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
He dropped out of college and you're building this business and

603
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
What a great thing that you're doing a needle

604
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
It's an awesome story

605
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
So we just started telling the story

606
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
So okay so you get this

607
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Article and then what

608
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Like as a result

609
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
People are calling you saying hey you don't want to buy like I want to buy a franchise

610
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,408
Guess we ended up getting article Fortune Magazine and they saw one of our trucks in San Francisco

611
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
Adam lashinsky the writer called and said

612
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
Saw this truck heard about you guys

613
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Seems like

614
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
The crazy business in Nigeria

615
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
You're building a brand in junk removal

616
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Yahoo.

617
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah

618
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
And

619
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Story came out

620
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
Hit the ground on a Thursday

621
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
And we ended up getting 506

622
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Phone calls

623
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
From Thursday to Sunday

624
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
So that we

625
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
We were flooded

626
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,312
These are people who are interested in buying franchises

627
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,896
Yeah I mean 506 calls imagine listening to that

628
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
I'm trying to write them all down and calling everyone back we were overwhelmed

629
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
So

630
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
I got on the voicemail

631
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:08,928
I said due to an overwhelming response from Fortune Magazine we are unable to call people back

632
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
If you would like to learn more about our opportunity

633
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Please call into this conference call at

634
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
At this time

635
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,656
What we did is we have like a hundred people show up on a conference call

636
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
And we would do a roll call

637
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:27,360
Of you know okay what city are you from in and we going to go through one by one all these different people

638
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
So everyone's like what I got all this competition I want to get in

639
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
And it drove the process quickly

640
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
And we ended up doing 53

641
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
French ideals that year

642
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,648
Which was just unheard of in the franchise space

643
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
And

644
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Things to start at the hockey

645
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Explode

646
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
I mean you are to adjust from running AC

647
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Small business to

648
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,728
To a pretty big company like almost overnight rather than all of a sudden you had

649
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
Always new franchise Partners in a huge Channel

650
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
When the beginning it was

651
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Great excitement

652
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Things were just

653
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
Building all this great momentum and we

654
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
We raced

655
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Pretty quickly to

656
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
A hundred million dollars in Revenue

657
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
What year what year

658
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
2006

659
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
And so

660
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
It was exciting and it was as energy in this momentum

661
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,376
But what was interesting about that time is it 2006

662
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
I realized I had my

663
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
President of my company my cool

664
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Cameron Herald

665
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
I was the best man in his wedding great friend we're still friends today

666
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,736
We Grew From together from 2 million to 106 million in a very short. Of time

667
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
But what started to break

668
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Was that

669
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
You had to add

670
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,440
Fire Ready Aim types at the top of the company

671
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
Yeah and and that just doesn't work

672
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
We we started to make poor decisions together

673
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Like what you do

674
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,984
We would overspending in areas where we would we would take some risks and we wouldn't really think

675
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
Through with any rigor and discipline

676
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
How would it affect our franchise partners

677
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,920
We had a truck roll out program where we said hey everybody needs more

678
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
Get more trucks out there and we

679
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,832
We put it in the franchise agreement that our franchise Partners had to increase their fleets by certain

680
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Period of time

681
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
There's some Rebellion

682
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
I mean it and I don't blame them

683
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,976
It was too aggressive and

684
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,840
I realize that we were making mistakes and you can't have the two add types

685
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Coffin

686
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
And I needed to find

687
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
A new leader and

688
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,520
Having to tell your best-friend that this is no longer going to workout is

689
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,592
A tough tough painful thing to go through for both of us

690
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,736
But we filled and moved on and and you know Cameron would tell anyone today Bryan made the right decision

691
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
So obviously I'm assuming you found

692
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Something else to tell

693
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Run the operations

694
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
I did so

695
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,512
One of the biggest mistakes I made was the second person I brought in as

696
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
The second president

697
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
And I brought in a next Starbucks

698
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Cool

699
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
And this person had

700
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,472
Can a president of one of the US divisions of Starbucks

701
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Done amazing things for that pill

702
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
30000 employees

703
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Under this person

704
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
Report to your thinking this person

705
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Sister slam dunk

706
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
They're going to do a great job for me

707
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Oh yeah I'm just

708
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Jackpot

709
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Unbelievable

710
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
But

711
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
We almost bankrupted the company

712
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Wow

713
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
After 20 years of growth

714
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
We went from

715
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
119 million in revenue is what we

716
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,400
We'd headed that peek at that time and we drop down to the 80s

717
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
What happened

718
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,032
For the recession-hit which didn't help but I don't buy for a second that that way

719
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Was really

720
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
CSUB

721
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
Because what really happened was

722
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
My president's leadership

723
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
In my vision

724
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Weren't aligned

725
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,856
I needed an Executor who could translate my vision and say

726
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
Here's the vision let's translated into a plan here's all the steps let's make these things happen I needed somebody that believed in me

727
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
And where I could also believe in them

728
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
So I

729
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
I got that person out of the business

730
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,448
How close to the company to falling apart

731
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
We couldn't have been closer

732
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,872
I mean I I would have given us another 90 days if we can continue down that path weed overspent so drastically

733
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
On big bats that didn't pay off

734
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
And Ida hunkerdown I had to lay off 52 people

735
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
I needed to elevate another team

736
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
The middle level managers up and I said

737
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,208
You know I know you might not agree with my decision

738
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
You probably think I'm crazy but I need your help and

739
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
What's the hardest. In my

740
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Professional life

741
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,216
Well my middle level management team who is elevated continued to run the business

742
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
I scoured the country for

743
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
The Right leader

744
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,920
I interviewed 75 potential president / cos

745
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
I said I need to find someone

746
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Whose strength

747
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Talents

748
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Wood

749
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Take all the things I'm bad at

750
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
And make them happen

751
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,744
And I painted this little vision describing exactly who I was looking for

752
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
I got it up to my network

753
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
And three different people totally unrelated

754
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
Said the person you describe is Eric Church

755
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Because you've only describe one person on the planet

756
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
And

757
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,080
I reached out Eric and I got connected

758
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,176
He was very happily employed he was president of a big Travel Tours and Company

759
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
And when the magic happened

760
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
It was just okay

761
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
We can see building this thing

762
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
Together we can see how we would eat

763
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Contribute

764
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Strength to the recipe

765
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
And we entered the

766
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
The partnership in the

767
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
It's been almost 6 years

768
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
And together we just

769
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
I mean we can

770
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Bait

771
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Discuss

772
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
And work together on the culture guy

773
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,032
And the vision guy he's the implementer of the rigor

774
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
He's the team building guy and it's

775
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
I mean it's

776
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,968
At what point did you stabilize they'll appoint were you able to say okay

777
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Would totally passive

778
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
When Eric Church came in

779
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,184
The first thing he did is he had the goals that I had put in place

780
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Lower them

781
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,536
He said listen Brian it's not that I don't believe

782
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
And you and that I don't believe in the goals

783
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,888
We're going to lower the bar

784
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Because we're going to teach people

785
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
What it feels like to win again

786
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,336
We are going to make sure we win we are going to put the bar low enough

787
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
That there is no way in the world we're not going to win

788
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
And when people start

789
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
Feel and taste that winning Feeling Again

790
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Confidence will build

791
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
Team will come back and so he thought about it a very strategic

792
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Landfill

793
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
And we made money in the first year of this new

794
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
This new business

795
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,888
Really taking 1-800 got junk and restructuring honking country that week we made money

796
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,032
How many cities did you guys operate in now we are in every major Metro in

797
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
United States Canada and Australia

798
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
So you name the city where there

799
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,992
I talked to a lot of entrepreneurs

800
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Michelle Wright

801
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,112
Some of them go the franchising route and then some of them decide not to do that

802
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Why why did you

803
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
I think the answer ties

804
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,280
To the person I am and what motivates

805
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
I've never been a Money Motivated

806
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
I probably would have made more money in the long term

807
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,240
If I done a corporate model in an IPO and raise money

808
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
But what motivates me more than anything is

809
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,872
Taking someone who's got the American dream

810
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Build your own business

811
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
But they don't know how

812
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,272
Giving them a recipe given them the cheerleading in the support and

813
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,344
And a team of other franchise owners who can come together

814
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
And so the franchise model to me was

815
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Isb

816
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
You got skin in the game this

817
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
This is your business

818
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
And we could build something much bigger together

819
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Versus what we could have ever done alone

820
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
NFL schedule

821
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
Who is Europe to go back to the eighteen-year-old Bryan

822
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
Like in that McDonald's drive-thru

823
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,872
And you could you're just there and you're like dude I know what's going to happen

824
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
To you over the course of your life

825
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
Listen to me

826
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Would you say that

827
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
I would say Brian

828
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Listen to your gut

829
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,464
Make the right decisions that you know with

830
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,048
All your heart are the the decisions that need to be made

831
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,168
Don't be afraid to make them in trust that everything's going to work out and I've learned that

832
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
You have storms in life

833
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
And

834
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Just like any storm

835
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
In real life

836
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
They don't last forever

837
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Yeah

838
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
One more question for you Brian which is

839
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
What is the weirdest

840
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Thing that you ever hauled off

841
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,440
I the weirdest thing I probably hauled off was I had a

842
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
Entire truck load of escargot shells

843
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
So some company who imported escargot went bankrupt

844
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
And that we loaded the truck and it was very light

845
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Kissing of the shells were all there

846
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,008
And the sky says to Migos

847
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
You can fit more in than that and I said

848
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
Beautiful chocolate syrup you can see the trucks full

849
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
So you came up with this idea on the customer's always right so we did it

850
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
He said

851
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
Go up into the Second Story the office

852
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
Jump into the back of your truck

853
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Collapse all those

854
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Shells

855
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
And set another load

856
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
So I we did it

857
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
Kind of fun you know screaming who is your jumping out the window into the back of the truck and we did we got another load in and

858
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:28,288
We had fun he was happy Brian scudamore founder of 1-800

859
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Got junk

860
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,664
Last year the company and their franchise Partners made close to 8

861
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Quarter of a billion dollars in Revenue

862
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Calling off people's junk

863
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
Sometimes that truck is

864
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
In recent years

865
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
They've come across

866
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
A Bible that belong to

867
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
John Wayne

868
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,792
An old airport X-ray scanner

869
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
And an ATM machine

870
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,936
It still had $26,000 in cash

871
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Inside

872
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:08,224
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the thing

873
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Your building

874
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,576
But first I quit thanks to one of our sponsors Microsoft

To learn more

884
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

885
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
I never how you built that

886
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
And today I did a story we ran

887
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
About a year ago

888
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,296
I just want to start Swindon zamir was planning her wedding about

889
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,624
4 years ago near her hometown of Fair Lawn New Jersey

890
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,416
240 guests

891
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
20 tables

892
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
$7,000

893
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,072
Just for the flowers I know Seven Grand

894
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:59,424
And it was that frustrating feeling of I'm spending all this money on something that

895
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,264
You know why I want to have it I don't want to be spending this kind of money on

896
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,336
Quite frankly anything that you know it's going to be thrown out

897
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,920
Anthony was trying to figure out how to cut down on the car

898
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,528
She thought about a friend who is getting married the very next day

899
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
What I did was when I was talking to the florist I was asking them you know

900
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,720
Is it possible to you know maybe have her Reeves the flowers maybe we can do some sort of sharing

901
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,536
That was kind of that light bulb moment where I was like

902
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
The force of telling me that

903
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Is can working

904
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
I know that I'll do it and I know that she'll do it

905
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,704
Okay so ultimately they need and her friend

906
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Could not make it work it was

907
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Too complicated

908
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
But she couldn't let go of this idea

909
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
So it didn't eat when I'm lying

910
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
And she start to search through wedding chat rooms and

911
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
Read through the thread

912
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
You have

913
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,136
Everyone just talking about you notes who's in the same area can we share this can we do that and that was

914
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,488
Another big moment of opening of customers you want to do this I'm not the only one

915
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,328
Who has had this thought I'd not the only one who's wanted to share my flowers

916
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
So the gears start turning her head

917
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
A few months later

918
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
Leaves her job at another startup

919
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
To start bloomerent

920
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
Fat Brides In the same city could log on to a website and then share flower arrangements with other couples getting married

921
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
On the very same weekend

922
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,808
Babies get a discount on their flowers

923
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Bloom Redwood get a cut of the

924
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
The florist fee

925
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
In a florist would make out really well to exactly so you know for them they got to create those centerpieces one

926
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
And sell them twice

927
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:35,680
But Anthony started to put her website together and then reach out to florists in the New York metro area

928
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
She was surprised that a lot of them said

929
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
No

930
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
You know it was interesting literally everything the person that you know this is a really good idea and I love that you're reducing waste and I know them

931
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Are you doing this

932
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
But I just want to do something new

933
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,832
And in so many ways that is both the most frustrating thing in the world

934
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
But it's also

935
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Eating really motivating

936
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,048
And so did he just kept at it and her first paying client was a friend getting married in New Jersey

937
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
And then things just kind of

938
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,936
Grew from there it was pretty nice to kind of see that like domino effect of

939
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
You tell one person who uses it and another person uses it and they tell their friend who tells their friend so we are now in 14 cities

940
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
We're all over the tri-state area so

941
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
We have a lot of really exciting things happening this year

942
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:26,112
Destiny Tamir we first spoke to her about a year ago she and her business partner have been working on a new

943
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
You service called bundles

944
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
Which lets couples easily

945
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,744
Buy wedding flowers online

946
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
So instead of going back and forth

947
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Coach

948
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Florist

949
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Couples can choose from one of three

950
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
3 bundles of flowers

951
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
Based on a budget

952
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
And that course they have the

953
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
The option to share those flowers

954
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
After the wedding on Boomerang

955
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,152
And like we mentioned all this started back when Denis

956
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
Was preparing for her wedding

957
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
And now

958
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
Denise is expecting her

959
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
First baby

00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
