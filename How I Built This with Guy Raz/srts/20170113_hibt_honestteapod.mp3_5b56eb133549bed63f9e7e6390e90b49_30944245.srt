2003 delivery of glass that was

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,184
Salty and so we ended up with some product in the marketplace that had broken glass inside the bottle

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
Contact with two different Whole Food store

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,304
And Whole Foods has a rule three-strikes-and-you're-out

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
No we can't afford as a business to lose our largest customer so we voluntarily withdrew all product on the market

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Every store totally stopped our sales

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
It was just painful

14
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Ramen PR

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
It's how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movements

16
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Gyros and the story of how Seth Goldman Honest Tea from a kitchen

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,360
Suburban Maryland to the shelves of virtually every grocery

18
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Store in America

19
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
So the year is 1997

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
Deckelman is living in

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Bethesda Maryland with his wife

22
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Three young kids

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,000
He's 32 he just graduated from the Yale School of Management

24
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Investment firm

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Chef

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
He's he's got an itchy he feels like he wants to start something and

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Keep nagging at him

28
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Day after

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
The day after

30
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,896
Thinking about different ideas maybe a web-based system that

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
Would raise money for public schools by tapping

32
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Into alumni Networks

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
Came up with the idea to simplify diagnostic

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
6 / urinary tract infections

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,720
They were a bunch of other ideas that would pop into his head but really got him excited

36
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
Until 1 afternoon

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,376
When he finished a long-run and walked into a convenience store

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,520
Hot and sweaty and I went to a beverage cooler and I said there's nothing here that nothing seemed to be like

39
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
And it was all a hundred calories per 8-oz and the difference was there no Fizz color

40
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
Different names different bottles they were almost

41
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Uniform

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
Bitter taste profile the sweetness profile

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
647 teaspoons

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Sugar per 8 oz

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Or not

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Why is anyone making a drink

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
1 or 2 to 6 like the little bits

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
Just a tad sweet

49
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
So how did you go from that to

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Thinking about starting a teacup

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
So when I

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Felt that Thursday I reached out to my

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Professor from busy

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
And when I hit Ferry Nova

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
When I've been a student

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
We had a case study of the beverage industry and we had agreed there was a myth

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
There was that space

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Sweetness Cafe

59
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,600
So I reached out to Barry I said I think I'm ready to do something about this I Iran

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
No not a TF Britain and more importantly not a beverage industry expert no knowledge of that and that was where

61
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
Having zero knowledge of the beverage industry in the beginning was

62
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Play competitive

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Because we went in without any of the Assumption

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
What are the things that happened literally

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
The same amount that I went for that running in New York City

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Was that

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
An investment my dad had made it 1977 so it goes

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
18 years ago

69
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
At the time

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,040
Came to fruition and I was presented with a check for $50,000

71
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
And

72
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
That was kind of the risk Capital enough for me to say okay well

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
Like I'm going to put this

74
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
This is if we lose this we lose it but this is what I'll bet

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
But at the beginning I mean you were thinking

76
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm going into a job but

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,776
I mean you were still young enough where you could always let go back in the final

78
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
That's right so you have a $50,000 check

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Dad and then and it was very able to put a little receive money. Barry had been on the board of a company that goes public

80
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
People cuz he kept his day job

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
As a professor professor

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
What was funny was that before I went to submit my resignation account but I kind of called Barry for one last boost of confidence.

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
I'm going to go in there you know you just had a third son but I'm going to

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Step down

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
And this is long pause he says what

86
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
I bet if you went to Calvert and asked to go on sabbatical I bet you they let you do that

87
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,407
I knew I had to take the plunge you couldn't

88
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Get investors to invest for employees

89
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
Or buyer to commit without

90
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
In a meeting

91
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Do a quick eye checks after

92
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Ura

93
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Father of three kids

94
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
What's a good job

95
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Calvert invest

96
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
And you tell your wife you're going to quit to start a Tea Company

97
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
You know nothing about nothing about that terrified you

98
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
More portly nothing about that terrified her

99
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,567
Yeah I think it was I believe in

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Myself probably a little

101
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
Pedicurist right like I think I can do this even though I don't know anything about it

102
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
But

103
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
I am ready to try

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,975
So you quit and then basically you and Barry what did you start

105
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
I do like how did you start to get

106
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
What did you start to raise money was that your dad was a little bit of the chicken and egg so the first thing we did was I I did write a business

107
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
When these days people really

108
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Put together power

109
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
If they don't write business

110
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
20 Page business plan

111
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,383
Mostly show the thinking behind the business I think every every potential investor wants

112
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Play some thought here about

113
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
About where this goes

114
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
What how it become

115
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
I managed to secure an appointment with Whole Foods

116
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
That early even even

117
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
Before you had a problem that was lucky because the the marketing director at Whole Foods

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
At that time a cup fresh Fields whole

119
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Amid Atlanta

120
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
He was a graduate of the Oakland Raiders

121
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
So he helped me get an appointment with Apple

122
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Wow

123
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
It's one of us here

124
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Versailles because

125
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
Somewhere I have read about you every time I look in the midst of all this happened at Whole Foods and

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
And all that excitement

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Your son Elliot

128
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,111
Protect the ultimate test in compartmentalizing because literally the day before the Whole Foods

129
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Our first presentation

130
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
When we

131
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
That's probably the most important thing in the cupboard

132
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Everywhere we go

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Amputee

134
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
And Barry and I are in the kitchen and we've got

135
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Mugs

136
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
Bowls that we're bruma T and it was not an

137
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Official looking mad

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
The kitchen

139
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Boulevard

140
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Sync my wife walks in with our

141
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Our middle son

142
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
And she's got this Ashen look on her face and and I

143
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
I don't know she

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Subset

145
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Made the kitchen such a mess

146
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
We'll clean this up

147
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Angie's List

148
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
We just came back from the doctor and lar middle son had a coarctation of the aorta

149
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
You're going to need major surgery within the month

150
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
And so

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Now that's a pretty heavy news to get

152
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
How old was he

153
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Intense

154
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
And

155
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,727
Probably if that it happened a few weeks early I probably went to

156
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Because

157
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
Health insurance benefits or just the risk level

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
Could do that but I've already taken the plunge I knew

159
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
You can you can bet that when I was at the Whole Foods meeting I was selling with great intensity of it

160
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Needed to succeed

161
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
And then

162
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
While Elie was in the hospital

163
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
I stayed with him that whole week

164
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
But I'll go down at

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
After midnight we had someone working on formulas

166
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
Plans and he would come in and meet me in the

167
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Lobby of Children's Hospital in

168
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Taste tea together in

169
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
If we paielli's bed

170
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
And I think

171
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Life happens

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
It's it's

173
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Part of the experience

174
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
It's part of the journey and

175
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
And I'm so thankful and

176
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
They have Ellie still with us and in such a delight in such a

177
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Wonderful presence you know

178
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
For me and and Ferb

179
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
EMC King about

You like

Pitching

182
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
This product

183
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Eno at Whole Foods in the midst of all this

184
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
Bring them samples it's like the Samsung made in your kitchen

185
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Patron in English

186
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Some random bottles or something

187
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,271
We we got an empty snap

188
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,903
But what's really funny is that Barry had sent over some Services when they in the mail

189
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
And when I met with the buyer and I

190
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
We poured out sample from the thermos totally empty Snapple bottle

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,631
Honesty

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
And he had said

193
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,287
I would like this sounds interesting will give it a try I will take 15000 bottles which of course

194
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Both terrifying and thrilling

195
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
How did you make that

196
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,759
How did you make that much teeth with the other so we got this and then next thing we did is we

197
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Basically went up and down that you

198
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
East Coast looking at bottling

199
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
We went to beer plant soda plants apple juice plants

200
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
So we ended up at a plant in

201
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Buffalo New York that was making apple juice

202
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,655
I'm down on his luck that's a line time available in

203
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Place where you can read the tea leaves

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
And so we

205
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
Brought in these mesh bag is large mesh bags that are actually clean a pool.

206
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
That was what we use boiling water and every once in awhile the bag with break and then

207
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Types of wood

208
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Claudia was it was not pretty how did you know that he was I mean that like

209
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
That was that was so funny

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
You know when I talked to Barry

211
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
He is very good at making things sound simple sometimes they are sometimes

212
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
You take a teabag you knocked out of water

213
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
If you multiply X 15000

214
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
That when you

215
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
Especially beginning to many tea leaves you don't get the full infusion

216
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
The back brakes when you really got a problem so we just had to keep

217
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Iterating

218
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
It was a very

219
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Makeshift operation

220
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
What's up once you had all the bottles had I mean how did it sell like this

221
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
To do well

222
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
So what happened was in arms we went to the shop nobody knew what it was

223
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
And so all that for some of the

224
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
This is 1998 now

225
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
All we did

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Make our marketing efforts

227
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Was me and

228
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
To intern

229
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Giving out sand

230
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Whole Food stores

231
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
And

232
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
We gave out more samples and resole

233
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,575
But by the end of that summer we were the best selling tea in the 17

234
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Fresh Fields Whole Foods

235
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Atlantic wow

236
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
And so what was then happening was that the consumers were starting to

237
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
For the tea which is

238
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,095
And then it was so different and end so what was nice is

239
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
We have most switching

240
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Some brands

241
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,519
Making the cereal category if1 out of Raisin brands on sale tomorrow go by post or whatever.

242
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Do you switch back and forth but with honesty

243
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
It's not there you don't go back and buy

244
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Snapple or Arizona because it

245
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
The Taste of Soul

246
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,551
And so when we got somebody and we were clearly not for everybody

247
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
They they were very loyal

248
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
What was like what was the thing that made

249
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Honesty difference

250
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
From

251
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Like everything else

252
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
That was in the market

253
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
So true things first

254
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Much less sweet than everything

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,215
The other thing in the reason the name Honesty made sense is because what we learned is most of the bottle T the US

256
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Set the time in still today

257
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Is not brewed with

258
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
It's it's

259
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
The powder or concentrate

260
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,247
If there's a relationship to the TV like the fish fillet there's a relationship to the fish

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
But aren't we

262
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Bring in the TV show

263
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
The plant can we bring them there

264
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Lemon soap

265
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
Once you were in Whole Foods

266
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
Pretty quickly after you launch it mean it seems like

267
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
You were sad because I guess the impression of the average person

268
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
So it was just a sweet was a star

269
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
And so

270
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
But we proved the concept

271
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Yeah and so then we will go back after investor and say we proved the concept

272
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
Now it's time to expand so we got more investment money raised and then we went to the other buyers

273
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
For the west coast and we went to buy us from other stores

274
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
You know I'm mom's my Organic Market here in

275
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Mid-Atlantic was one of our earliest accounts a day

276
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,719
They it was working there they started took to bring it to their other stores

277
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
So you're a mean

278
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Give me you're making a lot

279
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Of tea

280
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
You're growing what were the challenges

281
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
Hello there so many cuz it was still

282
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,079
Professional cash is always a challenge we weren't we were growing quickly but

283
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
We were spending money to do it we will head salespeople

284
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
We were doing marketing

285
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
And then just probably getting the tea

286
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
Stores right to the stores and any we were still getting rejected by all these distributor so Distributors are

287
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,023
The Gatekeepers are your drinks go because this is unlike

288
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Company

289
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
No matter how good our product is

290
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
We can ship it through the mail

291
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Beverages are a high turnover product

292
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
And so as soon as the Shelf empties of beverages

293
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Something takes its place

294
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
And so you need a distributor to be there to to build

295
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
To keep the Shelf space

296
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
I protected in Seoul

297
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,527
What happened was we were going to all the Distributors of Snapple in Arizona

298
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
And they were saying

299
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
When they returned our calls they would just say it's not sweet enough

300
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
They were expensive wow

301
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
It tastes like grass it's not what were used to which of course it wasn't an

302
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
What they were where they were not

303
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Effective as they

304
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
They were tasting it for their own

305
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
They weren't

306
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Thinking that's

307
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
This whole population out there

308
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
That's your has a difference

309
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Appetite

310
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,615
Did you amine went when you pitch it to investors who invested in life

311
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Kinds of things did

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
I mean

313
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
Were they saying oh this is awesome I can't wait to jump in or they just said

314
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
We're just saying

315
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
Did you get 11 knows we got a ton of nose and the main reason we got so many noses this was run now and sort of 1999 to

316
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Doesn't this winter in the home.com

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Yeah and we were very old economy

318
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
And so are you know people would much rather throw millions of dollars it

319
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Something.com

320
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Then

321
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Put a few maybe 10 or $20,000 in

322
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Sent you a beverage Gump

323
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
Acuity versus come in and say you know you

324
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
You should follow advicent

325
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,455
What am I supposed to do everything in

326
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Fancy message from Boston they said you know well you know you could

327
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
You should be an energy drink cuz that's really growing

328
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Nba.com

329
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,743
You know if you made the product cheaper you can make better margins on it

330
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,351
I don't sound like you're interested in the opportunity accept everything that we do

331
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Especially

332
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,751
But we also need it to really succeed in the long-term we had to be different than all the other big companies out

333
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
And if we

334
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
How to create a sweet tea there are

335
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
Tons of companies already doing that

336
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
But when you were in those early days

337
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,015
The scientist greater

338
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Well there's no question that would have led to

339
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
The faster growth

340
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
But it would have

341
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Diluted but we were building

342
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
This was about building something that

343
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
We could always believe in that we would

344
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
That would be meaningfully different in that

345
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
It to take people in a different direction you have to

346
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,495
Disrupt where they're going

347
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Seth Coleman

348
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
In the moment when we come back that explains how honest he became an actual political issue in the 2008 presidential

349
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Dental campaign

350
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this

351
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343

They give customers.

358
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
The tools inside

359
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
They need to transform

360
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Their ideas

361
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Impersonal initiatives

362

To success

363
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Let's Go Daddy

364
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663

Gyros

414
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
2 mm

415
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Honesty and become one of the highest

416
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Selling beverages at Whole Foods

417
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
And things were going pretty well

418
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
But then

419
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
It was a hit

420
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
The time the company had its own bottling plant

421
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Are Pittsburgh

422
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
And something happened there

423
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
They could have

424
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
Completely destroyed the company in 2003

425
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
We had a delivery of glass that was

426
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Salting

427
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
And on their lot of blisters in the in the glass Little League

428
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Look at it see little bubbles

429
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
And so

430
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
We ran it

431
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
The production line

432
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
Entered with limeworks is that if it ever sees a defect in the bottle it supposed to

433
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Kick it out

434
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Reject the bottle

435
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Madeline didn't do that

436
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
And so we end up with some

437
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,551
Product in the marketplace that had broken glass inside the bottle

438
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Contact with two different Whole Food stores

439
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,415
And Whole Foods has a rule three-strikes-and-you're-out

440
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
Borsalino one got hurt or injured

441
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
We did have

442
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Pieces of broken glass

443
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
At

444
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
No we can't afford as a business

445
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Toulouse

446
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Biological

447
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
So we voluntarily withdrew all product from them

448
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Every store

449
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,127
How much did I cost you well we were doing about

450
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
3 million for $9 in sales and

451
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
I totally stopped

452
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,575
Our sale so we lost several months of $700,000

453
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Huge

454
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,767
It'll just momentum stop or who you're trying to build you got your salespeople are trying to sell product instead of me calling all

455
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,119
Nnn it was just painful

456
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
Mashable until the 8 years

457
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
When I'm spending sprees we were sharing hotel rooms and

458
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Cutting Corners everywhere we could not in ingredients but you know just trying to

459
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Kit to keep the lights on

460
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
So what were you like what were you paid us

461
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
My first year salary was at 50,000 literally I took that $50,000 check and it was even

462
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
It was tax-efficient cuz I invested in the company that I paid myself

463
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
I don't think I got over a hundred thousand

464
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
For probably not

465
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,239
Really crew

466
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
This time with their like lots of other companies are offering to it to buy you guys out

467
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
Lots of companies along the way and he was very

468
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Parsley cuz we're growing quickly

469
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
Because we were doing something others weren't doing

470
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
So really from

471
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
From the first year we every year so we'd be approached by a

472
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Food or beverage

473
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
That wanted to Tobias

474
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
An arid like one of those most companies was

475
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
That lady and ends and they has a kind of trendy right here

476
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
Exactly what you're doing and just do it bigger and end

477
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
We were always that was another thing I could lose sleep about competition you and Barry owned like

478
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
Like 90% of your company even though you had

479
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
7 best

480
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
How are you able to do that

481
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
Well this was one of the key

482
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
Strategic elements that Barry brought to the

483
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
It literally is

484
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Professor of Game Theory and so

485
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
He said you know the problem with so many startups is the

486
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
Entrepreneurs give himself all these penny stocks in the beginning

487
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
And as a result

488
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
They start with

489
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Much more stock than everybody else

490
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
And then everybody else's kind of

491
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
It comes along for the ride is it but what if

492
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
Instead you started the founders at the same place as the other investors

493
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
And only when the company grows in value

494
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Do the founders get

495
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
More equity

496
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
That's

497
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
It was it was a reverse truck

498
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
And what that did was it helped

499
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
As we grew and we raised more money we didn't get diluted

500
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
Nelson was we relied on Angel Island

501
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
So a lot of entrepreneurs in the Venture Capital Motors

502
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Basically

503
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,311
There instead of istick to own more the company during set of eyes to exit quickly

504
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,687
And we didn't take that kind of money and I'm very glad we didn't at the I think that was a key piece that let us

505
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Keep control

506
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
What what did you what did you start to realize that

507
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
You know like honest

508
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
T was becoming part of life

509
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
The cultural Zeitgeist funny moment there was a moment

510
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
2008

511
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
President Obama had becoming honest tea drinker

512
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
I guess at the campaign for 2008

513
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:29,472
And the McCain campaign ad that criticized him for being a node out of touch with the regulation what's his favorite one

514
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Drinking organic

515
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
Stock of it in his life

516
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,672
And the cattle with him a few years ago when he brought over his the body man there

517
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
What do I have to have

518
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Wow

519
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
At what point were you able to

520
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Feel like

521
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Well I would say so

522
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
When Coca-Cola became an investment

523
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
2008

524
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
That was a surreal experience

525
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Because

526
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Approached

527
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,664
They approached us with a purchase in 2007 and they've had just created this group of venturing in emerging brands

528
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,504
And their goal was to invest in and build the next billion-dollar brand

529
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
And so

530
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
You know going to the headquarters in Atlanta sitting down with

531
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
The chairman

532
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,048
And and soda party was like looking down like I'm really here we're really having this conversation

533
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,144
So that was the first of all this is actually going to work this is going to be around

534
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Coke

535
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,216
But about 30% to 40%.

536
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,848
And and they bought an option to buy a majority which eventually

537
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Holi in 2011

538
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
But like this was your accompaniment did you

539
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Feel like you were

540
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
You were giving away control well

541
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
You know the story so often

542
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:54,208
When a brand is sold the entrepreneur gets really frustrated in the end they butt heads in the last few months

543
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
The friend of my friend of mine it was a vitamin water

544
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
But he left shortly after

545
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Coca-Cola body

546
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
First few weeks they want to know your

547
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Pinyin

548
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
And the next week I want to know your phone number

549
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,640
They don't want to know you

550
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
Give Coke a lot of credit they understood this is a branded that is different than what they sell them

551
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Target bacon

552
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Connect with the organic

553
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Consumer or the Natural Foods Marketplace

554
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
And so they gave us this incredible latitude in the autonomy

555
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
And there were moments where

556
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,560
We ran up against them around regulatory language or

557
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,680
Or just marketing approaches and they respected what we did so what's so

558
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
Continue to surprise me

559
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
This brand of storm Iran

560
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
And in the biggest part with the distribution we were in 15000 stores

561
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
When Coke invested never-never hundredths

562
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
So that's

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
That's where the difference is

564
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
I hope I never see right there

565
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,904
Early investors people who put in $50,000 income

566
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Beginning

567
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
Make a return of 1.2

568
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
5 billion dollars

569
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
10 years later that's right. 26 x there

570
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,168
Hurley investment you know how many millionaires were created by honest

571
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
I don't know

572
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,032
To me what was so exciting and some of our employees were wearing

573
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
Timmy was

574
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
You know that was all Sweat Equity

575
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
That they are in so that way

576
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
What's especially

577
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Meaningful

578
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
The question I've asked everybody who's on the show

579
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
How much of what happened

580
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
With you in Burien honesty was because

581
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,208
You guys are just really good at what you do and how much

582
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
I really don't believe in luck

583
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,096
I believe that the reason we're still here is the perseverance

584
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
And I'd citic centers luck

585
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
You know that it's the timing the way the consumer has evolved

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,336
But you know I've heard something so that you were in the right place at the right time as well you know

587
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,432
10 years to get to that right place so this was not a

588
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
This present

589
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
You know something that just happened overnight

590
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,624
A friend of mine like into to water you know eventually water finds its way

591
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
2

592
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
Going downhill when it gets to where it needs to go and I think

593
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
And we finally

594
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Got to a place where we could connect with consumers

595
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
And doing the weather was still meaningful

596
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
So I'm curious as you

597
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Metallic look back on all this

598
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
At like 1

599
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
William Quantrill

600
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
You either developed

601
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Or have it

602
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
You think all I do

603
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Well

604
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,112
You have to be resilient in this is this is something that's so important to put this on the bigger picture.

605
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
Just for like RR

606
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Resilience

607
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,048
What are the best ways I develop resilience growing up was I wrestled in high school

608
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
I was the worst wrestler on the team

609
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,960
My first year I was one and 10 and I was only cuz somebody didn't show up and I got the forfeit

610
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
So I had

611
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
I'm learned how to fight off my back

612
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
You know an endive

613
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Experience rejection and end

614
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
It's so important

615
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
2

616
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Be able to bounce

617
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Not just me all the time

618
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Am I pan

619
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
And especially when you believe in it

620
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,928
Makes it that much easier

621
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,024
That's Chef Goldman founder of honesty

622
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,864
By the way the company has sold more than a billion bottles of

623
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Beverage

624
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
It's all completely owned by Coca-Cola with

625
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,288
Annual sales of more than a hundred and seventy million dollar chef

626
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,640
It no longer formerly involved and though it made him a rich man

627
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Is life hasn't

628
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,784
Actually changed all that much that still lives in the same house in Suburban Maryland

629
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
But he made that first batch

630
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Honesty

631
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256

Hey thanks for staying till the very end because we are now at the

653
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Part of the show where we get to here

654
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
A great story about something

655
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
You guys are busy

656
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
My name is Glenn Auerbach

657
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
And I'm in Minneapolis Minnesota

658
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
And I've created a nice mug

659
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
In the IDF for nice

660
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Came about

661
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,392
It was on one of those freezing winter morning

662
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
In Minnesota

663
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Glenn Wyn

664
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Outside with backyard

665
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
And pick up a jug of water that

666
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Add Frozen overnight

667
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
Nature freezes water in a jug from the outside in

668
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
And from the bottom up

669
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
So you get kind of a hockey puck type freeze at

670
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
At the bottom

671
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
But there's this really interesting cavity

672
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
That freezes last

673
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
And that's an iconic shape

674
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,760
And that shape was a glass like the kind of glass you would put on your dinner table

675
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Perfectly formed

676
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Made of clear ice

677
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Sobini

678
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,976
Resourceful people that we hire with a beer in our hand we poured a beer in a nice mug was born

679
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
I mean

680
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Say USA

681
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Any more clearly than 8

682
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
Cold beer in a glass made of

683
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Ice

684
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
The first thing Glen did naturally was to

685
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Take the ice mug into his

686
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Backyard sauna

687
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
It held up

688
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Pretty well until

689
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
You know it

690
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Melted

691
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,760
So then I started messing around with different molds and different ways that we could freeze ice

692
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
So I experimented

693
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
Glenn came up with a plastic mold that seemed to do the trick

694
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
But it was a massive challenge for me

695
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
To make clear ice

696
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
And without clear ice

697
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
You get leaked

698
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
And leaks are no fun

699
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
The leaks

700
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,400
Actually come from air bubbles in the ice

701
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Plenti card for years

702
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
To come up with a mold that would make a mug

703
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Without the bubbles

704
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
And finally

705
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
He nailed it but never leaks

706
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
I'm really proud of that

707
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,736
Glen now sells and mold all over the country you feel it

708
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Does water freeze at overnight than

709
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Pop out your own ice mug

710
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
And this past year

711
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Some executives

712
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,184
Did Coca-Cola actually called them up and said hey

713
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
We want to use ice mug

714
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
In one of our ads

715
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Yeah

716
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:26,656
Was quite a rush you know the biggest Beverage Company in the world making nice mugs put in Coca-Cola in there we just had a

717
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Great time

718
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
For the time being

719
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Nice Mike is still Glen side Hustle

720
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
You're not planning on

721
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
Quitting his day job

722
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Is a Salesman

723
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,152
Anytime soon you know if we could send a kid through college

724
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
With the proceeds for nice mug while I couldn't be happier

725
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,064
And if you're wondering how long the ice mug actually lasts in your hand before

726
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Melts

727
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
We can have nice mugs that last like 30 minutes

728
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
45 minutes

729
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
I mean I suppose

730
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,328
The one thing that's cool about nice mug is when your ice is melted you're done drinking

731
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Clara box founder of nice mug

732
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
He lives in Minneapolis Minnesota

733
