Tofurky

00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
If you're a vegetarian or vegan

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
You may already be well aware that meatless meat

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
Is kind of having a moment

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
Restaurants that built their entire business model

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm feeding a Roundup animal flesh

Secret blend of 12 herbs and spices

35
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
Too ahead of ourselves

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,896
I should mention that humans are consuming more animals

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Than ever before

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,528
The percentage of vegetarians and vegans in the US has been substantially increased

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,624
Since 2000 but there is a growing segment of the population that

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,488
Is cutting back on meat vegetarian flexitarian

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
I just say this is a guilty flexitarian myself

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Eating meat is really bad for us

43
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Planet rice

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
Livestock production produces more

45
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,544
Carbon emissions than all Global transportation

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
While a lot of innovative entrepreneurs believe there is serious money to be made in plant-based protein

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,600
Just last month Ethan Browns company beyond meat and one of the most successful IPOs of the year

48
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
It's now valued at over 5 billion dollars

49
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
And another company

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,816
Impossible burger just raised a bunch of money at a 2 billion dollar valuation

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,400
What are people who indigenous

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
At least hope for really hard that all of this would happen

53
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Receptivity

54
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,616
Back in the early 1980s Seth was a committed vegetarian living in Oregon

55
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
Making and marketing a food that hardly anyone had heard of at the time

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
And for years Seth barely scraped by

57
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Do you even live in a treehouse to save money

58
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,256
But everything changed when he started selling a frozen holiday roast called tofurky twitch

59
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Turkey substitute made as you

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Probably guessed from tofu

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,704
Superheat quickly became a symbol of vegetarian pride and

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
The butt of many many late-night jokes

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
And all that

64
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Help raise its profile as more people became

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Ariana vegan

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Seth was eventually able to grow tofurky into the roughly 40 million dollar your company it is today

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,648
The company now makes all kinds of plant-based protein in Hood River Oregon

68
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
How far from Portland

69
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
I sat down with Seth and Ferb alive audio

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
Dance last month in Portland to hear more about

71
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
How he did it

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,240
I was a scrawny little kid and I was a very picky eater I subsisted on

73
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,336
Brown sugar and butter sandwiches and

74
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
Little baby puppies that my mom would shock

75
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
Can she leave me the baby peas raw baby peas which actually is

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
It's probably one of them

77
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Better Foods you could eat

78
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
But you know I grew up and I actually kind of hated Thanksgiving to be honest because

79
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
I would go down to my aunt

80
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Glenn and Uncle Ned

81
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
Farm in rural Virginia Palmyra Virginia

82
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
And

83
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
I didn't like turkey I didn't like mash

84
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
I don't like any of those

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Cranberry nut

86
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
And my mom would

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
And be slipping me like

88
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches under the table

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
I was a picky eater

90
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,551
And and what like what how would you describe yourself as a kid where you

91
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Studious review academic or you

92
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
I was maybe a b student ya growing up

93
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,791
Not really I'm the man was more sports-minded followed the local

94
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Gold sports teams

95
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
And like to play baseball my

96
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
Career goal was second base for the Washington Senators baseball team didn't happen but not yet I'm still here

97
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
If this could happen it working on it got to get those Senators back

98
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
All right

99
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
1969 Malibu 1969

100
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
Go to college in Ohio I think

101
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
You went to two different

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Colleges one was

103
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,255
Wittenberg Bergen wenzhou Antioch and and what did you

104
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Study you in college

105
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Well

106
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
The first disorder General courses and then I

107
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
When it came time to declare a major I

108
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Like kids so I

109
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Study Elementary education

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,359
Until I started taking these classes and found out they were pretty boring

111
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
And

112
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
Yeah so I dropped out of

113
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
School's Out

114
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Ended up in Annie

115
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
So this is like the height of the Vietnam War like

116
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
Outpost Summer of Love early 70s right this is

117
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,511
Just just an invisible force shutting but like

118
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Do you have any

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,887
Since that you were going to do a business and what did you think about

120
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
People who had businesses

121
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
What was your mindset about

122
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Oh I left

123
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
The business made

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Me and my

125
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Friends we

126
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Did not

127
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
You know Union Carbide DuPont

128
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,527
Yeah those are business General Motors General Electric they were they enemies it wasn't the hotbed of social

129
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Change so

130
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
We really I don't I never took a business-class

131
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
In college

132
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
And never

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Aspirations to be a business no

134
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
No not at all

135
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,399
So after I dropped out of school I became a naturalist actually a teacher Nacho

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Lost it

137
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
Glen Helen Outdoor Center which was run by Antioch College

138
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
And it was there that I really

139
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Discovered a love

140
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
Of doing things positive in the outdoors with kids

141
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
And

142
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
I was like this is what I want to do I want to

143
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
Teach kids but I want to be on the other side of the

144
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Classroom on the outside

145
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
So

146
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,231
Learn that trade and then I came West and I got a job right here

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
In the Portland area in Washington County teaching Outdoor School

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
Around this

149
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Time you're in your early 20s

150
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
You

151
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Come across this book

152
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Diet for small

153
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,383
Which lake has a huge effect on you what is the book for people don't know it and what what did you

154
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Learn from that but

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Well this was a book by Frances Moore lappe and she was the first person to point out to the

156
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
The American public and to me personally

157
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
That

158
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
The

159
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
There was no sense of

160
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Feeding all of these grains

161
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,119
Through animals you know you take 15 pounds of grains and put it in

162
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
To an animal you get maybe a tosser

163
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Pound

164
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Mead

165
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
As opposed to a few feet

166
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Grand Rex

167
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
People

168
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
You know you saved

169
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Show maps

170
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
Grain and resources and land and everything and

171
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
It made sense to me as a naturalist because

172
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,367
I was really concerned about habitat loss and I thought

173
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Well if

174
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
There is a sufficient way of producing protein

175
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
People that

176
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
That would be a lot less habitat

177
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,375
Loss and that inspired you to become a vegetarian like right away

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,519
Well that and a meal from a beautiful young woman my floral McAllen

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
Cooked a recipe of lentils rice and onions and

180
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
I just

181
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Talked about

182
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
Not needing to eat animals and

183
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
I thought boy this would be great

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,391
To be a vegetarian diet mainly consist of

185
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Vanilla wafers

186
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
Yum candy bars

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
It wasn't so good still

188
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
Mainstream right so there wasn't any

189
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
There really wasn't a lot of knowledge about

190
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Nesb

191
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,103
Effect of vegetarian diet

192
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Appoint

193
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
In the summer of maybe was like

194
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
475

195
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
Visiting a hippie commune in

196
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Tennessee

197
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Call the farm

198
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
Crack where you first discover this incredible thing

199
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
What was that what was that

200
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Visit what was going on there

201
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
How'd you end up there

202
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Well they were

203
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Pure vegetarian

204
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
And they took a vow of poverty the only eight

205
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Beans and fruits and vegetables

206
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,943
They had soy dairies all over the world Sri Lanka Guatemala

207
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
And when the

208
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Hurricanes

209
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,903
And tornadoes would go through Tennessee that go out there and they build houses for people

210
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
And

211
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
They do really good they were a great force for good

212
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
In the world and it wasn't

213
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Just sit around and

214
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Get high it was yeah you know

215
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
And although they smoked a lot of marijuana

216
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Vegan food

217
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Marijuana I'm really surprised that a hippie commune

218
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
In the seventies

219
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Marijuana

220
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
So is this

221
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
This is the first time you are introduced to this like

222
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
Thing called Tempe what do you remember when

223
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
It was

224
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Like heaven

225
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
It was so good we had all week

226
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
I remember making it

227
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
In that

228
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Hot Tennessee

229
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Summer which is a middle

230
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
It's like Indonesia

231
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Indonesia

232
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
If you haven't been there like about 88° which is a perfect

233
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
Tempe incubating temperature right now

234
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
Tennessee was the same way and so I

235
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Weather all the

236
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
Staff was sitting around on a weekend and I was making the Tempe

237
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
And I

238
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Put the beans

239
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
The inoculated beans out into it

240
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
Field just in a stainless steel pan

241
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
And the next day

242
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
I went over there and I

243
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Pulled up the lid of

244
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
The

245
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Tin foil and there was this beautiful

246
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,447
White cake of mold growing all over the beans

247
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,031
And it had little droplets of water on it and I was just like

248
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,359
This looks great and everybody on the staff was like

249
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
We're going to probably die

250
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
Penis is crazy guy

251
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,343
Seth I know that we are in Portland and so everyone in his audience can tell me everything about Tempe

252
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Pictures of Everly

253
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
People who are listening who don't know where it is

254
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Can you just tell me what temperature it is

255
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,071
Yeah absolutely so Tempe is an Indonesian protein

256
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Food from Indonesia

257
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
Soybean and the way you make it is you take the hall off witch

258
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Makes the beam splitter

259
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Two pieces

260
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
Two cotyledons you cook the beans

261
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
And you dry the beans and inoculate them with

262
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,991
Rhizopus oligosporus which is a mold member the mole

263
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Family

264
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
And you incubated for 24 hours or so at

265
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
88° in

266
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,743
It binds the beans together into the stick cake about the

267
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Texture of like a

268
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Paperback book almost nuke

269
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
You can slice it

270
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
So good

271
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
Alright so you're you're thinking all right this is actually pretty good

272
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
You I guess

273
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
End up going back to Oregon after the summer in Tennessee

274
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
And you kept making tempeh right

275
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Right

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
So I was started making tempeh

277
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
4

278
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Friends and family and

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
There were Retreat group so it come out so

280
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
They wanted

281
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,975
Some tempeh and I got an old refrigerator and I strung Christmas tree lights

282
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,815
Open side-by-side refrigerator refrigerator as a heat source

283
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
Back then not the LED lights these were the big old big

284
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
Flights

285
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
And then you're like a warm refrigerator to

286
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
Burn the house down with your Christmas tree lights

287
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
A little apartment in

288
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
We were living in

289
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
A teepee in the summer in

290
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Barn in the winter

291
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
This is the most NPR me

292
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
Portland conversation I've ever had my life up

293
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Johari

294
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
So

295
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
And how are you how are you cooking the Tempe just like what was your

296
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Just cutting it up and

297
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Frying it up like

298
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
Like bacon or what well I was giving it to the cooks at the retreat center who would

299
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
Hookers and reelers are very talented cook

300
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
So the retreat groups loved it

301
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
And

302
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
It was little income

303
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
My pocket

304
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
5 lb

305
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
The Tempe and I would bring in

306
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
$7

307
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
Yes when did you when did you get this idea to turn us into a business like

308
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
How did that

309
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Idea come to my

310
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Well

311
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
My girlfriend Kim and I moved into a house in Manning Oregon which is on the way to the coast on Highway

312
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
Which one is cigarette right down the street was this restaurant called the

313
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
The Java restaurant

314
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
And I was right in Manning

315
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
Which is a town of about 50 people

316
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
It's was the only Indonesian restaurant

317
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
A hundred yards from my house and I was this is a sign and so I got to go down and meet him

318
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
So I met this woman

319
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Ina

320
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
And she was the

321
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Proprietor of it

322
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
And I said

323
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
It doesn't look like you have tempeh on the menu

324
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
And she goes

325
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,167
You know how to make tempeh you know about Tempe and I said yeah I can make you some

326
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
She said

327
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
Really and so she ordered 2 lb

328
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
And I and she said but it's got to be good

329
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,895
And if it is I'll order more and I'll sell it to all my friends

330
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
So I went there and

331
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
I made that tempeh I brought it back she liked it and she ordered 10 more pounds

332
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
And because of that I felt like you know this is a good sign so I went to the local cow

333
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
Co-op Forest Grove

334
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
And

335
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
I asked if they would rent me their kitchen

336
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
At night and they said yeah

337
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
We can run it out to you for

338
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
$25 a month

339
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
So it was like grape soda

340
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
December 1 1980

341
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,455
I sent you an my stamped envelope to the state of Oregon and register

342
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
Turtle Island soy Dairy as a business as a business

343
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Imagine light

344
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
99.9% of people you came across your life

345
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
What's tempeh

346
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
Does what

347
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
Will you having to

348
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Explain this

349
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
Over and over and over again people

350
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
And not only with her

351
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Are people saying what is tempeh but

352
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
People are telling me this is a pretty bad idea

353
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Yeah

354
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,151
Like I was at the school

355
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
And in Forest Grove substitute teaching that make some money and I went into the last day of teaching

356
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Announce to the

357
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Lunchroom

358
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Teachers that you know I'm going to

359
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Start making

360
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Tempe

361
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
And I was just like

362
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Oh my God silence

363
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
What and then I was like yeah it's moldy soybean

364
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
And they were like

365
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
That tastes like a paperback binding

366
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
I didn't mention that

367
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
Shut up but they

368
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
And then finally

369
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
One of the teacher said

370
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Well

371
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
You can always fall back on teaching

372
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
Always one of a fallback I always say that to entrepreneurs

373
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
Right you always wanted to know if

374
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Tempe

375
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
All right and you were doing this all by yourself

376
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
I was doing it by myself and I was driving

377
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
In my 3 door

378
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Beat up

379
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
Somebody damaged Datsun station wagon

380
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
And

381
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
Then it was really the co-op's that

382
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Kind of embraced it

383
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Nurse staffers

384
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
And who was buying

385
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Tempe in 1981

386
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
What's it's like

387
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Really kind of

388
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
Hippies and just for the record you know this

389
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
I love him

390
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
I make my own tempeh bacon

391
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
All right I'm just going to clear by then

392
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Full disclosure

393
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,815
Who was buying tempeh in 1981

394
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
It was the early adopter

395
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
Right

396
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,543
In marketing terms starting to get

397
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
You know it's really starting to ramp up production

398
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
Contacts cuz you're not really making any money

399
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,807
But you had to find a bigger space I guess in 1981 in jail

400
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
Who's to Houston well yasso in April

401
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743
1981a distributor called Applegate Natural Foods

402
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Out here in Tigard called up and said

403
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
We need you to make a

404
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,447
1000 lb of Tempe a week wow and I was making like

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
The hundred pounds of night on a good night

406
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,079
And a lot of it was coming out bad and I was

407
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
Composting in my garden much to the

408
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
The light of the local rufous-sided Towhee population yeah

409
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
Find a way to do that so I needed a bigger space now

410
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
We were grossing like

411
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
$1,300 a month at that point and so I started looking outside the Portland metropolitan area and I went

412
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
Map to qusome which is about 70 miles from

413
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Here is the fear of small little town

414
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
And

415
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
I looked in

416
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,079
The window of a school building there was an old vacant School building out there

417
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
And I looked in

418
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
The window and there was this perfect

419
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Tempe kitchen I was like

420
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
It was a commercial kitchen

421
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
And it had

422
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Two big huge

423
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
Stainless steel sinks that had stainless steel

424
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Pool tables Hood

425
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,703
And if even had to store rooms that were just the right size for a tempeh incubator

426
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:22,079
It was just sitting there and it was a for sale sign on it and so I called up

427
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
The superintendent

428
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
And

429
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
He was

430
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,783
Saying yes we really want to sell this but as we spoke he was thinking

431
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
We haven't had anybody

432
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Offering on it so maybe we would rent it

433
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Uso

434
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
I said could you put me on the docket for the school board

435
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,815
Meeting and so he was nice enough to do that and so

436
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,679
My brother Bob came out and we cooked up some tempeh

437
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
Wow horde the local school board

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
And will they think

439
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Oh well

440
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Yeah

441
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
This is 1981 yeah and people even the earliest they weren't the early adopter

442
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
They were

443
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Skeptical but

444
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
They were

445
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
Open to the presentation and I made tempeh salad and I

446
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207

00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
For the strips and I

448
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
Better to them and then the conversation turned to

449
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Well how

450
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
How much could you afford for rent

451
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
If we did rather show you which was the conversation I was

452
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
West Reading

453
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Divided

454
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Have much money

455
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
So

456
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
I said how about

457
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
$150 a month

458
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
It was just like

459
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Silence

460
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Yeah I know buddy

461
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
Said anything for a minute and then

462
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
This one woman who was

463
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Kind of like really enjoying the Tempe

464
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Chico's

465
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
I say we take it

466
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
What do we have to lose

467
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
So you get

468
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Amazing

469
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
She get this commercial space

470
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Abandoned School

471
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
450 bucks am I

472
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
You got to make a thousand pounds of Tempe week by the way

473
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
What you know about running a business

474
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
So I know nothing

475
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
Are you like Alexa

476
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Don't like

477
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
I never felt like I you know

478
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
The businessman

479
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:21,119
Yeah I heard I never opened up and he said you are a businessman

480
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,263
Did you keep any All or nothing like that

481
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
You know I've always felt like a little misfit

482
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
Yeah business world so still doing a lot of

483
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
So just to be clear you were making tempeh

484
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
It's like 1983

485
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
You are not making money

486
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
You are not enough

487
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm your living kind of

488
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
Pretty modestly I think it is a certain point that year

489
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
You couldn't afford your rent

490
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
What did you do

491
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Well

492
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
There was a couple of

493
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
Strategies but one was

494
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
The postmaster of the Town had given me a

495
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Apartment to rent

496
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
Free she said we just need somebody to live there yeah

497
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
And so I was living rent-free

498
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,015
And I was thinking how am I going to make money and turn this thing around

499
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
And I said

500
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
I've got three classrooms

501
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
That I can rent out

502
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
And so

503
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,720
One classroom I rented out to my friends with a graphic

504
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Art business

505
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
And they were good pairs

506
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
I had

507
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,704
The other classroom I rented out to a mom-and-pop wooden fruit basket company that were making fruit box

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,848
Okay and then I had this one more classroom and I'm like what am I going to do with her class but couldn't find a rental you know this is

509
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Poor part of foot

510
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Sac County

511
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,248
And one day I'm sitting there in my office and I look outside and here comes the

512
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Does purple

513
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
And it's got a Yellow Umbrella

514
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
And it pulls up

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
These two guys get out

516
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
And they come in and they go

517
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
My name is

518
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Space and this is space

519
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
And we're clowns

520
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
And I'm like okay

521
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
And they said

522
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
And we

523
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
Tune pianos when the

524
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
The clown businesses song

525
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
Okay

526
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
And we need a space

527
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,992
For our clown business to build prop

528
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
And I was like I think I can provide you that space yeah

529
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
And they were people are like

530
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
You're going to run to these clowns I'm like

531
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,304
You had me an ace in Spanish

532
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
So

533
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
But you're living rent-free

534
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
But eventually you got what you got

535
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Kicked out of your apartment will have the rent Market

536
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
Got a little better and so now there were people that would really pay for that

537
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
That apartment so you got

538
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Kicked out yeah

539
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
So I don't have a place to live

540
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
And

541
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,040

542
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112

543
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392

544
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Rent me for trees

For $25 a month for $25 a month

546
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,632
And then I could build a treehouse you could build a treehouse

547
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
$25 a month

548
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
Which you did

549
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,896

551
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
What did you have in there

552
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,208
Well it had a wood stove so it was insulated and you know it's very warm and cozy in the winter

553
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
It had three levels it had a

554
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
11 foot by 16 foot

555
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,168
Ground floor and then a sleeping Loft above that and a little cupola

556
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
And was kind of the first tiny house

558
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,592
And the tree house was on a Frisbee Golf Course

559
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
So I'm living on a golf course

560
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
American Dream

561
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,392
Pretty amazing right you are going to the school every day making tempeh

562
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,256
But you know your sort of approach your late thirties and

563
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
You're really here

564
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
Not making any money in your living treehouse

565
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Cool but

566
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
You know I was for the Wii U

567
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
Stressed out like we're sitting pretty like I got to figure another figure something else I need a new strategy because

568
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
I don't know this is going to

569
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Be sustainable

570
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Yeah

571
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
The thought came up

572
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
And actually in 1986

573
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
I had an offer to sell

574
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
The Tempe business to a local tofu company

575
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
They offered me $25,000

576
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Or the business

577
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
Which would have been life-changing money flow

578
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,008
And then I could go work for them for $1,000

579
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
A month

580
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
And

581
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,640
I thought about it long and hard it took me about 9 months to decide

582
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
You know whether I'm going to take this or not and

583
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
Went through a lot of those questions at that time and

584
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
The end of

585
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
The lion I just said

586
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
I like

587
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,696
I'm growing and I'm going to stick with this so

588
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608

What are you

655
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
Were you ever like gun

656
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
I don't know did you ever heard of anxiety over

657
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
I don't know what I'm doing my life for

658
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Yeah I was

659
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
I had some existential nausea

660
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,760
Yeah how about that you know I did feel like a failure in the business sense

661
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
But I felt

662
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Like the mission sense you know seeing this

663
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Tempe business grow and seeing people

664
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Eating more and more of a

665
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
The product

666
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
It was satisfying and I was involved in local

667
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Activism in the

668
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,424
Ecoworld I had a very fulfilling life I'd I never I mean

669
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
There was

670
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,776
A. Towards the end of that where I was really

671
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
Starting to wonder whether it was ever

672
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
Going to take off and I was looking for

673
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Ways out

674
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
I guess run around

675
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
The next movie 9u

676
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
You were dating somebody

677
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
Who would become your wife Sue

678
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,952
Did she move into the treehouse with you or

679
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't know what it's like how does that work

680
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,120
You know it's funny because right now people asked Sue they go

681
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Does he make you sign a prenup

682
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
And she goes

683
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Prenup

684
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
What was the one that needed the prenup he lived in a tree

685
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
I have the house

686
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,200
So she said that you got the move in with her

687
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
So yeah she got a house on the ground

688
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
And so yeah

689
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,024
Eventually I guess I guess around 92 you made your way to Hood River

690
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Here in Oregon

691
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
I know your plant is still today

692
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Why did you move from

693
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Washington State

694
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
To that to that location was going on

695
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
Well towards the end of the Houston run the

696
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
School District had sold

697
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
The building 2

698
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:40,224
A guy who turned out to be a crook in the jail time but then it fell

699
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Into the

700
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Local Firehouse

701
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
Also the it's now the firehouse a few items

702
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,696
What's a great deal on the you had to find and I had to find a new space and

703
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
There was an oil

704
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Tortilla Factory

705
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
In Hood River

706
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Which is 10 miles from Houston

707
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
And we rent it out

708
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,704
5000 square feet of this 26000 squared

709
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Building

710
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
And I borrow the hundred and

711
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
$60,000 from Bob your brother my brother just financed a retrofit

712
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Always

713
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
In the early days

714
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Funduro

715
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
Your brother

716
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Like business

717
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Well yeah

718
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,928
Anybody had a bigger heart than a business sense

719
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
And he was always

720
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
Loaning me money and I would be paying it back

721
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Not always on time

722
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
You paid it back

723
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
So I'm curious I mean because

724
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
It's really is the

725
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Sort of story pivot

726
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
This is where

727
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Add something totally unexpected

728
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Expected happen

729
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,128
I guess there's like these vendors that work with you they want to

730
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Catering business

731
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Just couple the Robles

732
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
And there they were like a

733
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
Vegetarian catering business

734
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Buying tempeh from you correct

735
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
And

736
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
They

737
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
They're making like

738
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232

00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
And he was in 1994 I was delivering Tempe to him and he was making us around Thanksgiving

748
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
These stuff

749
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Tofu roast

750
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
He had been working on

751
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
And he was selling them

752
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
About 2:25 or

753
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
50

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
Ear and

755
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
They were

756
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
A dome of tofu with stuffing

757
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
In the middle and I was

758
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
Always looking for something to eat at Thanksgiving

759
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
And we had tried all these

760
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,336
Stop pumpkins that kind of collapsed in the oven

761
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Gluten Rose the word

762
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Too tough to cut with a chainsaw

763
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,248
So we were failing and then I saw it with Hans this is

764
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Something this is kind of

765
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
And so

766
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
And

767
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Suet been working on

768
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Burger at that point

769
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
That we had rejected cuz it tasted like Thanksgiving

770
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
And

771
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:06,400
We thought I wonder if we make these into not Burger shapes but drumettes

772
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,752
And so we made them into Tempe drumettes you may Tempe drumettes

773
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
We made drumettes right

774
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
How to Tempe right you said what you said can we maybe

775
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,832
So that first year we bought the the tofurky to Market here and this

776
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
City

777
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
With

778
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,696
Hans and his team

779
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,280
It was it was a frozen tofu loaf stuffed with

780
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
So it was like

781
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,888
Whole wheat bread crumb and cranberry stuffy nose really delicious

782
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
And what else came of the box

783
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,336
And then there was a top of gravy that once again haunted created of nutritional yeast gravy

784
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
And

785
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
That never sleeps 8 Tempe Drummond

786
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
Vegetarian sitting around leg

787
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
Isn't that an eight legged turkey

788
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
No

789
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:03,744
But we didn't know it till 4 cuz look like in the wild

790
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
But we knew they had a leg

791
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Wow

792
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm just curious looks okay this is important

793
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
This name is super important

794
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:15,264
They are making the disliked stuffed tofu Dome

795
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
It's around Thanksgiving time

796
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
How do you name a you come up with a name for it

797
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,200
Okay so I didn't invent the name Topher

798
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,784
Right in 1981 when I was delivering

799
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Tempe around Portland

800
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
There was a tofurky

801
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Sandwich

802
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Gofur k

803
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Eey

804
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
And it was being made by King Harvey

805
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Local sandwich

806
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,376
Liquor here in Portland over slices of tofu or deal with slices of tofu

807
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Sort of Turkish

808
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
Rights-based

809
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
And

810
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
I thought I would buy those when I

811
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
I really liked

812
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
But I always love

813
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
The name

814
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Tofurky

815
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
A lot of people were

816
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Against the name

817
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
But at that point

818
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
I was ready to change

819
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,576
Something cuz I had been trying to play it straight

820
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,208
As a businessman and make it look like a hippie didn't get within ten feet of this food

821
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Then

822
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
Tofurky I mean was more

823
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Whimsical and fun

824
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
And

825
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
And I just thought it was more me

826
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,264
I wasn't getting anywhere by pretending to be a businessman so why not

827
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
So tofurky riding tofurky

828
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,152
Collaborate you you decide

829
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Cell

830
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
The first batch of

831
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Tofurky

832
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
I guess you

833
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
Freezer section Frozen

834
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
Frozen and you sold them

835
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
$30

836
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Each in 1995

837
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
That is super expensive

838
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,072
Did you get pushback from retailers who were like $30 in the

839
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Freezer section by this

840
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,752
Yeah we did you know but the once again it was the coops that rally

841
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
To embrace the concept and

842
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
And people loved it

843
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,760
We put self-addressed stamped postcards in every tofurky that year we sold 818

844
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
Postcards work for feedback

845
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
It was for feedback from the customer people said

846
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,696
Oh my god I've been waiting 20 years for this product

847
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,768
And it was just so heartening to

848
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
Right away feel like

849
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Finally

850
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,912
I can see my way through this and Thanksgiving

851
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
Thanksgiving saying I mean PCC up in Seattle was another one that embraced that they put in a tofurky

852
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
The hotline

853
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,712
They were getting so many orders and they're going crazy for it

854
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
I think about

855
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,344
Straight year after making a first-half rookies you you wouldn't Robles

856
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,184
What kind of winter separate ways you you actually know the second year

857
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
We were making we went to a tofu maker and Hunt setup

858
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,352
Baked tofu which baked out some of the

859
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
Sponginess out of the tofu

860
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
And

861
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
It's it didn't look

862
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
So pretty plated so

863
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
It was still a problem

864
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
But

865
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
That was the year that we actually

866
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,456
Went online and sold

867
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,576
Three hundred of these online you know that tofurky was one of the first Frozen products

868
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Text ever to be sold

869
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
On the internet wow

870
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
The first thing that was ever sold online was

871
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
A pepperoni pizza

872
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
1994

873
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
The first food

874
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,448
Was sold online this is 1996

875
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Tofurky

876
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
And and when did you

877
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,824
I'm a certain point you have to change the recipe right because

878
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Tribal loan was not going to cut it

879
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Presumably

880
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
Come make it into a

881
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Things you could slice

882
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Jason really was

883
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
It wasn't to be spongy

884
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
So what did you do

885
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
So

886
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
The third year in 1997

887
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
A friend of mine who had

888
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
Had a failed safety

889
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
Damn company called me tough weed

890
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
Came to me and he said

891
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
Meet

892
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Yeah

893
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
He had figured out how to

894
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Strew these roast in

895
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
Have stuffing in the middle and they would have

896
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Seitan

897
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
I'm on the outside

898
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
And we tried it and we thought

899
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
It's good but

900
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
I wonder what it would be like if we had a tofu to it

901
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
And so we

902
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
Add tofu and I mix the seitan and the tofu yes

903
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
And it became

904
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
Tofurky and that's essentially what is today

905
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,048
It's essentially the same thing we ended up

906
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Actually

907
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
Buying the recipe from

908
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
The amazing thing and I guess it's not that amazing

909
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,240
When you think about it because it was called tofurky

910
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
You got all this

911
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Attention span

912
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Today Show

913
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,152
And comedians were joking about it

914
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,712
And it when you work you did not have an advertising

915
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,064
When you saw comedians joking about in people mocking it

916
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,696
Were you were you sad that you feel humiliated a real like yeah right on keep doing that

917
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
It was more like the right on

918
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
Cuz you know up until that point

919
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
Our marketing and then

920
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
All of an app

921
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
Natural food marketing wasn't very Whimsical or funny

922
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Your farnan this was like

923
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Fun but

924
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,568
It was also in the early days

925
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,176
People kind of took offense to it a little bit cuz you were taking on and iconic

926
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Turk amerikan

927
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,528
Bill and holiday and everything and

928
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Bringing

929
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,600
A tofurky to a dinner was always come

930
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Controversial and yeah

931
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,208
Even in into the late 90s

932
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
You really pivoting now

933
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512

Do you know where a lot of it was

941
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
What they call a paper loss

942
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
But it was still a lot we weren't really

The end of the day in

947
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
And we were

948
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
Borrowing money where needed

949
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,792
And it was but most of the money that was being borrowed was for investment into equipment

950
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
And things like that did you were you able

951
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,448
Two in the late nineties start to see a light at the end of the tunnel because

952
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
I mean were you thinking

953
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496

See where this thing might be

957
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Oh yeah

958
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Just from the first

959
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Response to the tofurky

960
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
Felt so different

961
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Different than anything I had felt

962
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Before

963
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
Marketing Tempe that

964
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
I really felt like

965
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
This is going to

966
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Really

967
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
Turn around at some

968
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,120
And it really did and you're right that a lot of the

969
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Media exposure from

970
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
The Wall Street Journal to the New Year

971
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Your times

972
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776

00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,872
Put the Washington Post on hold to talk to the New York Times it was crazy

974
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
Code for episode

975
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
That was like

976
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224

Trees with turn golden brown and

980
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:00,512
He would come the tofurky and he would come the media to us until we had Millions

981
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
You're 20 years in

982
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
I mean how was your business Acumen at that

983
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:11,008
Little better

00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,824
Sue Helm yeah did you have more

00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Yesu was

986
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Doing the books at that point.

987
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Good

988
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,248
So we had books yet accounting good yeah

989
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
No it was improving

990
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
And

991
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
I was becoming less stupid every month

992
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
When we return

993
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Prophet

994
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
2000-2001

995
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
Right about then it became really

996
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
Profitable because

997
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,144
We brought the production of the tofurky into

998
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
In the house we were buying it from a manufacturer Komander

999
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,312
And then we brought it in house and we started making

1000
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,360
Sausage Deli slices

1001
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,432
And we went to the same buyers and said

1002
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,248
Hey would you like Deli slices and we found it

1003
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,136
Play tofurky in this new recipe sliced really well you can leave recipe

1004
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Right bicep slightly different

1005
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,536
Right and smoking and we we smoked it in a real Smokehouse and created the smoke

1006
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
Hickory smoked so when did the slices

1007
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
First timeout

1008
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
Those came out in 1998

1009
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,496
And and then the sausage is followed and the sausage followed

1010
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Prayers later

1011
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Did they become popular pretty much right away they really did they really took the industry by

1012
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,224
Storm and we became

1013
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Happening comfy

1014
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:31,136
So when did you actually I don't know if you remember the point where you

1015
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
I know you woke up and you were like

1016
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
We're making a lot of money

1017
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
This is a

1018
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
This is not me

1019
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Treehouse

1020
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Turn up temp at a bathtub

1021
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
Like we're actually

1022
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Eat a lot of money

1023
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
What's an odd feeling

1024
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,288
Do you remember cuz I was pretty good at losing money yeah

1025
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Would you remember when that happened

1026
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Well you know when we

1027
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Baidu

1028
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
At the end of the year you know

1029
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
Having enough money

1030
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
Give some nice bonuses and

1031
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
Pay off a lot of debt

1032
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,463
Was that what 2004-2005 yeah right in there you know it was really a

1033
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
A new world for me

1034
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
And people that

1035
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
Wouldn't talk to us about Tempe or now

1036
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Clamoring for

1037
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Puerto perky

1038
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,495
It took us tofurky took us from being a Regional West Coast

1039
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519

1041
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Distribution

1042
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,895

1043
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
Factory today

1044
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Hood River

1045
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
It's a leed-certified building you've got

1046
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
200 employees

1047
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
Think I mean your your your revenues

1048
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,975
Somewhere between 40 and 60 million dollars a year wishes

1049
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Unbelievable

1050
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
I'm everywhere right you're not just a like

1051
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Whole Foods in

1052
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
Co-ops and Trader Joe's your life

1053
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,447
Walmart Target

1054
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
What we're seeing right now is the mainstreaming of plant-based foods and

1055
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
We're in

1056
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,223
27000 + stores worldwide

1057
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
It's really

1058
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
A friendly world for plant-based Foods now at

1059
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,927
Yeah we love to see all great tasting vegan companies succeed

1060
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:14,047
Partly because we're Alturas and we're mission-driven company and we want to see plant-based Foods

1061
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Grow

1062
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
All over the world

1063
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,287
But it's there's a business reason to which is that it's easier for us to place products

1064
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,431
In a category list

1065
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
So here's the thing right

1066
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
You are

1067
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
Entirely

1068
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Family-owned

1069
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
100%

1070
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,671
You your brother or maybe some other family members own

1071
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Tofurky

1072
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
I have to imagine

1073
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,047
Over the years certainly over the last few years

1074
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
You been approached by

1075
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
Private Equity by big companies

1076
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
Who have offered you a lot of money.

1077
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
To buy you out

1078
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Yeah that would be correct

1079
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Why not cash in when I when I take the money in and you know you you work for you to lose our tree house for 7 years made 30,000

1080
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
I mean right now

1081
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
Only at this point in your life

1082
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Are you actually

1083
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Sing real money

1084
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,391
And you could

1085
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
You could be

1086
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Rich beyond your

1087
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
Wildest dreams

1088
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
And for the next 6 Generations

1089
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
When I take it

1090
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
I feel like I'm rich

1091
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
Beyond my wildest dreams right now to be honest

1092
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
I mean to have

1093
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,127
To be in this business has been you know how to get joy and

1094
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Great

1095
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Feeling of my life and it's

1096
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Taking me places that

1097
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,087
I'm still I'm able to travel around the world I'm able to work with nonprofit

1098
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
Groups like fig annulare that are

1099
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
Just getting going over here

1100
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
I can't think of a better

1101
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
Dream at this point in my life I just feel like

1102
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
Like the luckiest guy in the world

1103
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
So this is

1104
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Is important because

1105
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
I've been reading

1106
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
That you actually cannot produce enough of your products

1107
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
For the demand

1108
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
It seems like

1109
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
The answer to that

1110
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Challenges

1111
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
A cash infusion

1112
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
To build another production line

1113
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
Right we've we have just borrowed

1114
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Some money

1115
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Investor

1116
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
We really

1117
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
But it's a loan it's not it

At the center of our

1124
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,471
Lives and so that nobody can tell us what we can do or can't do

1125
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495

Cuz you know Seth has as many of you know I

1145
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:20,415
Almost always in my interviews with one final question. Just curious if you're a people answer it you know and we get it

This company do you think

1149
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
This is because of your heart working

1150
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
Your work ethic and your skill in your intelligence

1151
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
How much of the story do you think is to

1152
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Just luck

1153
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Timing

1154
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
That's a good question

1155
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Certainly luck

1156
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
