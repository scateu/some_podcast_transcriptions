Enjoy

36
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
I quite frankly thought I was at the very bottom of my Barrel I mean there were days where

37
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
I didn't want to live I mean the internet to find me the article called

38
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
The most ugly names in the world the people on Twitter saying the ugliest things but

39
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
But through all of this pain and struggle I still had an itch to create

40
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
And so I kind of sat down and said I can start something right now and I can change what I hate

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
That I see in the world

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
NPR

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
It's how I built this

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
A show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Stories

46
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Behind the movement

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
They felt

48
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,832
I'm gay

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
How Whitney wolves

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Exit from

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Hinder

52
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Aspire to build bumble

53
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
A Kinder gentler dating app

54
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Where women

55
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
Make the first move

56
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
There was a time believe it or not

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
When internet dating men

58
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
You weren't

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Awkward or both

60
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
It wasn't something you talked about openly

61
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
But today

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
It's the complete opposite

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Because the Internet

64
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
And dating apps

65
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
So much easier and

66
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
More efficient to meet Lots

67
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Lots of people

68
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
It's more less frictionless

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
Is no awkward phone calls or

70
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Courtship rituals are

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
To face rejection

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
There's something almost

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Transactional about the whole thing

74
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
And it's no exaggeration to say that

75
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Even though they've only been around for

76
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
5 years or so

77
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Dating apps have

78
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Pretty much

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Transform dating

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
And if you love them

81
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
You can thank Whitney Wolfe

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,344
Or you can blame her if you hate that because Whitney was part of the dating app Revolution

83
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
She was one of the founders who helped create

84
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
Tender which is now one of the biggest dating apps in the world

85
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Whitney left

86
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
Tender under difficult circumstances

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Sansa circumstances

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
Can't legally discuss but as you will hear

89
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
It was a time in her life where she came under intense online abuse

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
And that experience would Inspire her to build bumble

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Which is a difference

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Kind of dating app

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
And today

94
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Just

95
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
3 years since

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
It's launch

97
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
Bumble is one of the top dating apps

98
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
In the US

99
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
But the story of how Whitney got into that world at all

100
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Well

101
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
Like many of our stories it starts with

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
A little bit of luck

103
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
Right after she graduated from college at Southern Methodist University

104
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
In Dallas

105
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
I was just

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
Kind of going day by day

107
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,568
Flooring and and being okay with that right

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
I think

109
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
To my family I almost

110
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Was

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
I don't think it was

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Proud

113
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
My daughter went on to do a

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
It's right I was in this

115
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Weird place

116
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
So I kind of moved in with my mom in California

117
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
And I went to LA one afternoon

118
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
To visit A girlfriend of mine

119
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
And ended up at a dinner

120
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Where

121
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
I

122
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Met a couple people

123
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
One of which

124
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Went on to be the CEO of

125
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Tinder

126
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
This was Sean rad

127
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Yes

128
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
And he had told me how he was

129
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Going to be the general manager of this

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
Incubator that would be launching all sorts of

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Alternative

132
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
If an apps and they were looking

133
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,927
At the time they were focused on one app which was a consumer loyalty app

134
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Call Cardiff I kind of like a digital punch card

135
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,351
For your favorite coffee shop for your favorite whatever it is and you told you about this

136
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,959
This dinner party yeah we were just having dinner or just a few of us and

137
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,335
I said well that sounds really interesting and when he asked what I was doing is that you don't really looking for a job I think I could

138
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
Probably help you Market your app

139
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
And he said why do you call me tomorrow and come in for an interview so I called him at 8 a.m. the next day I think he was alarmed and

140
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Surprised that I actually called him

141
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,903
And I end up going in for an interview it worked out

142
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
Started working from home right away and then I moved to LA

143
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
For this

144
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
For this incubator

145
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Yes for Cardiff I was the app

146
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
There been really no talk

147
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Tender yet and my job is very much focused

148
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,031
Chordify so I started working full-time

149
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
And while we were getting kardify off the ground you know I spent a lot of time going door to door to door in LA to

150
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Different

151
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Restaurants and

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Boutiques and so on and so forth and trying to sign them up and

153
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,975
I struggled with it because there's too many moving parts right and so

154
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
I mean you have to get the store on board

155
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
And then once the stores onboard you have to help

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
But the customer has the app

157
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
What were the stores interested when you came in but they like it

158
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
No

159
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
To be honest

160
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
A very few people were interested

161
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,687
I think it was really how you positioned it and I learned I learned a lot

162
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
True through that experience

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Because

164
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:18,367
You know one pet could go one way and you say something a little different the next time I go in a completely different way

165
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
And so I really

166
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
Realize that it's not so much about

167
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
The what

168
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
It's the

169
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
The how or the

170
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Why you should do this right like this is why you need this instead of

171
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,983
What you what you need right and so it was really interesting crash course in

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
In marketing and sales

173
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
But you are not

174
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Attack Force

175
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Necessarily you just really interested

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Great

177
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,479
I wasn't even interested in Tech I was just interested in the

178
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
The the way it had reach

179
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
The way that Tech

180
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Hood

181
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Expand beyond the walls

182
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Right

183
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
I went through college with no Instagram and so

184
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Instagram really be

185
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Became huge right as a graduated

186
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
And then you

187
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
Thoughts of four billion dollars and I think everyone kind of went

188
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
Well yeah and this was kind of like a

189
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
And I opening

190
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Moment for my

191
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
My peers

192
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
And so

193
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Didn't I mean

194
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
Did you put it like a sense of excitement.

195
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
Put on something big or did you know pretty soon after

196
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Not going to work

197
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,415
No you know I think everyone was really excited and very hopeful and it was a beautiful app

198
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,047
I think everyone really wanted it to happen and I remember we're all sitting around like we're going to be the next big thing and

199
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,935
And then shortly thereafter I think we started getting excited about this side project Matchbox

200
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Which

201
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
With what became tender but it

202
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
The time it was Matchbox

203
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Which was supposed to be a dating app

204
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Yeah it was like a flirting app

205
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
It was like connecting people to flirt right

206
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
And after we were really unable to get kardify to gain significant

207
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Traction

208
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
I think we all know you know

209
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
The first

210
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Few of us

211
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Kind of like

212
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Maybe we need to shift gears you know and I was

213
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,071
22 years old I just come out of college I was thinking very much like

214
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
College students

215
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
This will work and I think I was so excited about the fact that they're

216
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
What's something that I and my friends would use First

217
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
If I twitch

218
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Something a person would have never used

219
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
And again it was not a

220
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,479
New idea you have to think about what existed already

221
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Dozens of dating apps flirting apps

222
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Connecting apps

223
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
I mean there was already the Behemoth which was match.com right

224
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
And we sat on the same floor as match

225
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Nli

226
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Sosa was

227
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Was building tender

228
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
Blake Parvin idea to build like more of these

229
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
Dating type

230
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Products are

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
So tender was not my idea I've never said it

232
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,127
Is My Idea ever I became a co-founder of Tanner via my marketing contributions in my early

233
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
Involvement in getting it launched and getting it out there

234
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
So

235
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
I've heard about 30 completing

236
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Stories of

237
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,879
What the original idea was Andrew who really cares at this point

238
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
I mean it is what it is and it was to connect

239
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
People around you you know if you see

240
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
See someone that you want to talk to

241
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
2 across the room how do you

242
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
How do you talk to them

243
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Without

244
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
You know

245
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Feeling awkward I think

246
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Where we went

247
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,359
In a very unique Direction was marketing at Millennials and I just don't think that had ever been done in a successful way

248
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
And what was the actual product

249
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
What was the app what it look like

250
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
It was very similar to what it looks like now is just a very early version of it so you just

251
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Swipe left or right on people that actually

252
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
When I first saw that there was no swipe

253
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
It was like a tapping like a card game originally

254
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
And was it called Tender by that

255
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
No we played with so many different names I mean

256
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
Maybe going to be flirt and then it was maybe going to be

257
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
I mean there's so many different things

258
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
I was going to be and

259
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Tender ended up sticking

260
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
So you're so you're thinking I like this thing has legs

261
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
And so what did you do how did you do

262
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
Yeah I remember thinking to myself that it would work at SMU

263
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
And I remember I

264
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Took the guys into a meeting

265
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
And I gave them my little sorority fraternity

266
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Roll out pitch

267
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
And said

268
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
I'm going to show up on Monday when I go to chapter meetings I'm going to run to the sororities

269
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
Eternity is going to get everybody on it

270
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
And then it's just going to take off at SMU

271
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Yes at SMU

272
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
And so I got the green light

273
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Go do this and we had

274
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,271
Very very very very minimal marketing materials I think I had three or four t-shirts

275
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
That we talk

276
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,927
That had tender on it and then I had to get really crappy so when I landed in SMU

277
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Funny I was talking to my girlfriend about this the other day

278
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,119
My good girlfriend who now does the weather in La she was a year younger than me so she hadn't graduated yet

279
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
And I took a picture of her

280
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
And then I took a picture of one of my guy friends on campus

281
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Drop them into the match screen like a

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
The tender screen

283
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
And I wrote a big thing on top of it saying find out who likes you

284
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
ICampus

285
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
And I save the file and I took it to the FedEx

286
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
Across the street from SMU and we printed

287
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Copies

288
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
And I

289
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Offered a bunch

290
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
People around campus $20 bills

291
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Help me

292
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Put them everywhere I mean

293
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
People's windshield

294
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Under dorms

295
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Everywhere everywhere everywhere and then

296
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Monday night I rallied all of my friends that were still in school cuz again I just graduated a lot of friends

297
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Younger

298
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
And we've made our round

299
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
We went to the sorority houses and gave a pitch

300
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Got up on chairs and told all the girls

301
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
You know you have to download

302
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Because

303
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
College is all about meeting people and right now you only have access to the

304
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
The people that you hang out with every weekend and it's a really

305
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,047
Close minded it for you no experience and you guys need to meet all the

306
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,887
Describe people on campus and there's all these really cute guys waiting for you on the app

307
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
We rushed and got all of these women to download the app

308
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
And then we ran as fast as we

309
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Because to the

310
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
The Fraternity Row

311
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
And when

312
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
The Frat houses and said a different pitch and said

313
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Hey guys

314
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
No other way to access

315
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Casino hundreds of sorority girls right now

316
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,671
Download the app because they're all waiting for you they've all just downloaded this app and they're waiting for you to like them

317
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
And so

318
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Yeah I know it's so ridiculous

319
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
But you have to picture you had to listen me how's it going to work

320
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
You were hustling this thing

321
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Yes I think that would be an accurate

322
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Representation

323
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
And so the next day I remember

324
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
You know we looked at the download numbers and hundreds of people had downloaded overnight and hundreds was bigger than the downloads

325
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,575
We got on chordify over months and so you know I'm looking at hundreds of downloads and I'm like we made it

326
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Find the next Facebook right.

327
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Just being

328
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
Super

329
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
You know a little disconnected from reality probably not that

330
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
Distances we would eventually discover so you go back to LA

331
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Like What's Next Step

332
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
I can't remember if I went straight back to LA if I went straight to Utah because

333
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
I went and did the same thing at University of Utah

334
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Which seems weirdly

335
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
That that one

336
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:10,271
Tenderete a new people there you know and it's funny I called this a long time ago I said to everyone on the

337
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
The team I said guys watch

338
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
BYU

339
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Will be one of our biggest markets one day because

340
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,767
In the BYU at the LDS College in in Provo Utah

341
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,839
And they're all expected to get married by

342
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
By the end of college like that is the excitation

343
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
That's why I said I promise

344
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
I think BYU will be one of our biggest markets and I think

345
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Half of Utah wind up getting married because

346
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Tinder

347
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Tinder became massive

348
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
In Utah BYU campus oh yeah

349
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Wow

350
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
2013 you know

351
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Wizard feeling like this is just

352
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
So amazing so exciting

353
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Are you kidding yes

354
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
I mean

355
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
I lived

356
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Breathe dreams

357
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
I was in golf

358
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
I mean my friends didn't want to talk to me anymore then I go cache

359
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Contact. Tender again

360
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
No it was such an exciting time and

361
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Again it's worth noting

362
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Tinder was group app

363
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
Right it was not just me it was not just

364
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
One of the guys is not

365
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Just one of the other guys

366
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
This was really

367
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Teamwork

368
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
So

369
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
And go do something

370
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
We need that we don't often do in the show which is

371
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
I would you skip over a / 8

372
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
A few years went

373
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Tinder was growing in

374
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Dating app

375
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
Millions and millions of users

376
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
Because they're legal reasons

377
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Why you can't talk about certain things

378
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
I'm just going to say I'm going to

379
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Explain briefly

380
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
That you left

381
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
10 Durant way

382
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
2014

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,503
Under pretty difficult circumstances you had been

384
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
In a relationship with one of the other co-founders

385
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Where's that broke down

386
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
And so

387
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Left

388
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
And it was a sexual harassment lawsuit and that

389
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Settled in

390
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Ask about that

391
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
But all the sudden you were you were all over the tech press

392
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
People

393
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
People caught wind of this lawsuit

394
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Text messages that were sent

395
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Q70

396
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Republican flodgin

397
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
And all this time you were the public eye in and you were

398
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
I guess like twenty-four what 24

399
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
25 of the time

400
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
I was 24 I turn 25

401
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
A few days later

402
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
And you were the main target of of a lot of the attention

403
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Surrounding

404
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
So real quick I'm going to jump in in

405
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
Just say I have absolutely no comment on anything

406
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Lawsuit

407
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
And I have no comment on

408
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
You know any of the allegations or anything

409
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
But

410
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
The way

411
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
The people online

412
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Spoke about me

413
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
The way

414
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Both

415
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Reporters

416
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
And complete

417
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
Strangers you know internet

418
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Twitter

419
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Comment section

420
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
It was

421
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
It it jolted me

422
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
In such a way it it completely robbed me of every last

423
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Sounds of confidence

424
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Ants that I may have ever had

425
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Listen I was not

426
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
I was not

427
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
A famous person in my life

428
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
Salt Lake City

429
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Parents

430
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Quite frankly just

431
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
A normal professional right like that's just

432
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Who I was

433
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
And to have

434
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
The New York Times calling

435
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Extended relatives

436
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
And to have

437
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,783
The Daily Mail knocking on the back window at your apartment when you're not even there

438
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
And

439
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
To have

440
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Your

441
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Personal

442
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Emotions

443
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,535
Being turned into caricatures on

444
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
Tech blogs and mainstream media

445
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
TMZ I mean

446
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
It was

447
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Really truly

448
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
How did you display get through the day

449
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
I I quite frankly

450
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,503
Thought I was at the very bottom of my Barrel I mean there were days where

451
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
I didn't want to live

452
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
I didn't want to get out of bed

453
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
I felt

454
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Like it was stamped across my forehead

455
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
And when I say it was stamped across my forehead

456
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
That was fifty different things

457
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,399
That was the article calling me the most ugly names in the world

458
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
That was

459
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
The people on Twitter

460
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Saying ugly things

461
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
I mean the internet to find me

462
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
For a moment

463
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Time and

464
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
I I wanted to die

465
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
Yet I had to

466
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
Make this bigger than myself

467
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
Right like this is bigger than me

468
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Meaning

469
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
I have people in my life that I have

470
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Be there for I have parents

471
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
If I have friends

472
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,679
I need to continue my career I'm 24th that's B25

473
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
I am not going to

474
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Just

475
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,103
Call it a day at 25 I mean am I you know like there was a lot of that

476
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
And

477
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
After I was able to pay

478
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Take myself off

479
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
The bath mat crying

480
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
I

481
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
I was able to

482
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Through the fog

483
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
See the real problem

484
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
And the problem was not

485
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,839
Or the media or the story or what happened the problem was

486
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
The lack of online accountability

487
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
That

488
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
Human beings are exposed to every single day

489
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
And what it made me realize was

490
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
You know whatever I felt was going on online

491
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
This is what goes on a 13 year old phone all day everyday

492
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
And it scared me

493
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
Was it impossible to ignore that 7 could you have just shut that out

494
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
No

495
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
It was a possible

496
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
It just became this

497
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Obsession and

498
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
It really messed

499
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
With my psyche I mean it and it made me

500
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Really

501
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,679
Not right for a while I mean I didn't really socialize I

502
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
I kind of

503
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Became a Hermit for

504
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,567
2 years and what I did during those two years was I work

505
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
My tail off I mean

506
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
I worked

507
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
So hard

508
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
And

509
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
What I

510
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Had realized was you can't kill ambition

511
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
You can kill confidence but you

512
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Can't kill Drive

513
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Through all of this

514
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Pain and struggle

515
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
I still had an itch

516
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Inside of me too

517
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Create

518
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
And I missed

519
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
The feeling of

520
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Creating all day and

521
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Building

522
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,471
And think something grow and

523
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
Engineering it to grow right you know marketing it

524
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
And so I kind of sat down and said

525
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
I can start something

526
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Right now

527
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
And I can have an impact

528
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
And I can change what I hate

529
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
That I see in the world

530
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,367
When we come back

531
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
How Whitney took that idea

532
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
And turned it into bumble

533
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791

00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
What's in your wallet

565
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Capital One na

566
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,952
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

567
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Gyros

568
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
By the time she was 24 years old

569
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
Whitney Wolfe had already helped launch what are the world

570
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Biggest

571
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Dating apps

572
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Tinder

573
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,520
But after she left the company in everything that would with its up online bullying in

574
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
Severe depression

575
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
What do you want to

576
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Get away from all that she wants

577
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
Get away from dating apps and build something new something

578
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
A little more kind

579
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
So I started working on this concept called Mercy

580
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
What was going to be was

581
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
Female only social network

582
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
Women only use compliment

583
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
They would no longer be able to

584
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,144
You know comment on appearance or hurt their

585
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Hurt each other's feelings

586
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
Or use social media to bully right

587
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
It was the antidote to what I

588
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
I experienced online

589
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
And

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
I

591
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
Started working on this end

592
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Had

593
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
You know my marketing plan mapped out and I

594
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
I was thinking about doing that and I was approached by

595
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Minot business partner Andrey andreev

596
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
And he is

597
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
Incredible

598
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
Talented entrepreneur

599
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Based out of London

600
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
He is built

601
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
So a lot of berries

602
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
Successful companies

603
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Send

604
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
His current very successful company is called Badu and it is the world's largest dating platform

605
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
It is massive

606
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Overseas

607
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
I mean we're talking

608
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
I think I have something

609
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
320 million red

610
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,648
I like they're part of that club of only LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram like those

611
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Big big big crazy numbers

612
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
And he said

613
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Sorry to connect

614
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,632
The summer I know that's probably not the best time for you but I'd really love to hear what you're up to

615
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
And so

616
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
His initial

617
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,032
Intent was to hire me as their CMO their Chief marketing officer

618
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Scrappy-Doo

619
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,408
And I said you know I'm flattered that's great however

620
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
I mean

621
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Essentially not

622
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
Higher I'm supposed to start my own business and I want

623
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,088
But to be mission-driven and I don't want to work in dating like that's just not

624
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Going to be my future

625
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,464
And he said okay so tell me about this vision of yours and what

626
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
What you going to do when

627
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,864
How you going to build this into a huge social platform and I told him I vision and

628
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Yes and

629
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
He could hear and feel my passion for

630
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
This platform and he said you know what

631
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
You need to build this but you need to do it

632
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
And I

633
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,248
I decided I'm not doing and I said I don't think you understood me

634
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
I'm not going back into dating like that's not happen

635
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
And he said no no no this

636
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
This hat

637
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
What you're trying to do

638
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Needs to be done in dating

639
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
And I thought to myself you want maybe maybe he's got a point maybe dating is broke

640
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
Right like maybe maybe connecting is broken Beyond just being a young woman talking to a young woman in junior high May

641
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
Maybe this is something that affects us at all ages

642
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,688
And so we kind of did a handshake deal instead of here we can build a company

643
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
And

644
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,040
We formed an incredible partnership where

645
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,648
I was founder and CEO I could build my own team my own Vision my own brand

646
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,000
But we would have access to his resources Beyond just money and that was

647
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Something that was never going to happen

648
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Twice

649
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
And you didn't know at this point you didn't know what

650
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
That was going to be

651
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
No

652
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,520
It's a really wasn't until a couple of weeks later when we brought on you know

653
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
I called

654
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,408
Crystals in skin ceramic who had worked with that Tinder there really

655
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
Really talented designers and you know in order to build a great

656
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Brandon

657
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
And product you have to have a great

658
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Define arson so

659
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
I brought them on board they had their own apt

660
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
Times that I wanted to come on as consultants and so

661
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
Once we were all kind of together I think there was like 10 of us in the room or something or

662
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
We're sitting outside in

663
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
Andre said okay so what is this

664
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Product line

665
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
And I said

666
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
I think I have it

667
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
And I said

668
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
I always wanted

669
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
2

670
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Text the guy first

671
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
I always wanted

672
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
To go after what I wanted

673
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,344
In terms of if I saw a cute guy in class I always wanted to talk to a guy but I was never allowed to

674
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Because society and my friend said no

675
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Pyside we're going to reverse-engineer this

676
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
And this is how the products going to work

677
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
You're going to mutually match with

678
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Each other but

679
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Women hats

680
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
They 24 hours to do it

681
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
Because it would give them you know

682
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Kind of incentive

683
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
And if they don't the match

684
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Pierce Brown

685
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
And

686
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
This will

687
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
Change the Dynamics of how we

688
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
This will put the ball in her Court

689
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
Freddy same-sex matches

690
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
You follow the same rules minus

691
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Women making the first

692
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,232
Rights of two women match either woman can reach out if

693
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:13,632
Two men match either man can reach out however they do still have to follow that you go first in 24 hours and then you follow with

694
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
24 hours

695
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,776
Like completely different from from everything else it was was out there the time

696
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Completely different

697
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Dating apps

698
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
I think I imagined

699
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,968
Are most mostly guys are signing up

700
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Well

701
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
My theory at that time was

702
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
They hadn't been built for women

703
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Let's just look at this from from the basic

704
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
Men are raised

705
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
From very early age

706
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,888
To be the go-getter in a in a heterosexual relationship

707
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Go get her

708
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
GoGo make the move right

709
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
And women on the flip side or trained

710
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
2

711
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Play hard to get

712
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
So sure you're telling men

713
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,176
To be overly aggressive and hear your telling women

714
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,784
To be the inverse of that and so now you're at your training to human beings

715
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
To act in

716
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
Opposite directions

717
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Each other

718
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
And so what you do when you do that is you

719
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Set both

720
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Up for failure

721
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
You set the man up to be constantly rejected

722
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,864
And you set the women up to be at risk of

723
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Of aggression

724
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Abuse

725
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Right and so

726
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Here we have this world

727
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,800
The behave this way now add another element

728
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
The profile write a digital

729
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Shield

730
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,784
Where you can hide behind a username or profile photo and you don't have to be accountable

731
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
And so

732
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,928
When you when you put women in control you completely reverse the roles

733
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
Soaps she now

734
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Has

735
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
The confidence

736
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
To go after what she's into

737
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
And the man on the other end

738
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
Doesn't feel rejected he feels flattered

739
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
And then all of a sudden you've balance

740
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
The behavior

741
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
So so so where did the name bumble

742
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,200
The name bubbles actually really funny so a woman who was a really actually a great

743
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
Mentor to me for the first

744
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Couple of years a bumbler name

745
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Michelle Kennedy

746
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
She named it on a whim one day because it was such a

747
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
Struggle I wanted Bumble to be mocked

748
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
The Moxie like you've got moxie

749
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
You've got courage right

750
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
Because you'd have Moxie made the first move

751
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
And unfortunately there is a really powerful company that exists somewhere in America

752
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Trademark

753
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
Every format of the word

754
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
So we couldn't get that and then we were sitting there for weeks on my gosh it was a disaster we had probably a thousand words in the Run

755
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
And then one morning she said you know

756
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
I think she

757
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,440
Funny enough I think she called her husband a bumbling idiot she's got this really horrible British accent

758
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
She said what about Bumble

759
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
And I said

760
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,632
No way like ethics Bumble that the Bumble and Bumble the hair product I hate it

761
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,032
And then Andre was like bumble bumble I love Bumble and he checked the domain and we could get their domain

762
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,920
It was a miracle like in what world could we get Bumble but we couldn't get Moxie we couldn't get all these other words

763
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:12,320
And so after that I was talking to who she ended up becoming one of my shoes my third higher

764
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Her her

765
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Her family are really

766
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Close friends of mine

767
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
I was talking to her mom in the kitchen with a k

768
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,328
About Bumble for a nap and she was like oh like be the queen bee of bumble

769
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,192
Find your honey on Bumble and she started throwing out all these really cute slogan I don't like it done

770
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Perfect branding opportunity

771
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,872
Hives and bees and building your your hive and queen bee the women make the

772
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
The first move it was perfect.

773
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
So you

774
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Andre

775
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Contacts yuan July 2014

776
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
If I'm if I timing is right

777
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
You launched

778
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
Bumble by the end of that year

779
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,280
Cracked we worked really really hard when you when you first launched it

780
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Were most people signing up man

781
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Initially

782
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
No no no

783
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Even even split how did you

784
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
How did you get people to sign up how did you get the word out about it cuz there's a lots of competition in this faces

785
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
Tons and tons of dating app how did you

786
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
How are you able to tell people that and get to know

787
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
What to do

788
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
Well I kind of had a little bit of a Playbook I may be done at 1

789
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
What's before so

790
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
I went right back to SMU

791
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
This time

792
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
Decked out in yellow and

793
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
I went back into all the sororities

794
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
And I I spoke from the heart listen

795
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
I have lived

796
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Through

797
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
The pain point

798
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Male-dominated

799
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
I have felt

800
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
I know what it feels like and guess what

801
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
Every Other Woman in that sorority house

802
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Chances are she's healthy

803
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
So you know I'm speaking from the heart and I'm speaking to them about how they can be empowered and they make the first move and they go

804
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
After what they want

805
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
Me and my early team members I mean

806
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,952
There's the girls are at my office right now they're still with us

807
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
We went in there and we took pizza boxes with stickers on it and offered a piece of pizza to the fraternity boys that would get on at we

808
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,680
Wrapped cookies in Bumble stickers we took

809
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
All sorts of goodies and

810
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,544
We kind of growth hacked our way to

811
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Success

812
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
Jump out of the story for a sec

813
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Migas

814
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
I asked you about this idea that

815
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
That

816
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Dating apps even even Bumble with

817
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Your mission or purpose to empower women

818
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Even an app like bumble

819
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
You know does it

820
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Contributed

821
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Culturehook

822
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Well

823
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
So here's with interest

824
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,960
If the hookup is taking place and the woman is empowered and feels comfortable and confident in that

825
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
Then I say more power

826
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
To that

827
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
You know I don't care what you do on Bumble if you want to

828
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
You know

829
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,736
Spend the rest of your life with someone you meet on Bumble phenomenal if you want to hang out with him for only

830
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
A night

831
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
But you're going to wake up the next day and you're not going to feel terrible about yourself

832
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
That's what this is all about it's about reverse

833
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Engineering

834
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
The Dynamics

835
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
How men and women

836
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Peel and

837
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
Bumble is not just a hookup I mean

838
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
I can't tell you how many emails I get a day about

839
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
Bumble weddings Bumble babies Bumble engagements now we're launching bumble bizz

840
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
We have

841
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands if not in the millions of the

842
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Is point of active

843
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
BSF user

844
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
Which are

845
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,832
You know young women matching with other young women kind of in that merci capacity I spoke about earlier they're finding roommates

846
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,928
They're going on trips together they're building Social Circles in new cities

847
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
It's really not a dating app anymore

848
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,352
I rather that that you guys have zero

849
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
There's zero tolerance for sexism

850
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
On Bumble but if

851
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,008
Two people are communicating on Bumble how do you police that how do you enforce

852
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,128
So that's a great question and it's actually a very tricky one

853
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
So

854
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
We have

855
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Zero tolerance for bad

856
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
Behavior

857
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,808
But it requires a little bit of work from our user

858
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Because

859
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
We also want to

860
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Respect your privacy

861
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Right

862
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,024
However if somebody is in a conversation and someone says something inappropriate

863
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,144
We have very easy reporting tools and once something is reported we do review it

864
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
And if there was bad behavior that user is banned

865
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
For life there are no Second Chances

866
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,104
We really take it seriously if you need us like

867
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Work one click way

868
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Do you ever

869
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
Rent any backlash from from you know people who

870
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Who say

871
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
You know who are offended in some ways

872
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
The disempowers women that if it does it does it make

873
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Some people angry

874
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Yes

875
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,512
Bumble gets a lot of that you know just last week we

876
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Became under attack

877
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,584
From this website called the

878
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,400
The daily Stormer a Neo Nazi site

879
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,960
And we had upwards of a hundred men standing up

880
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Rats

881
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
We actually had a

882
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Police that are off

883
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
That's all we got wow

884
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
They were emailing my employees

885
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Calling my employees calling me

886
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Leaving the most vulgar messages

887
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Because you're you're self-proclaimed

888
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Feminist organization

889
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Female empowerment is not something that they

890
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
They believe in unfortunately

891
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,208
Fina we get this to that the bullying

892
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Now I don't let that dozen

893
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
Hurt my feelings anymore cuz I know the

894
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
These people are just atrocious but

895
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
It fuels me the anger fuels me to

896
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,704
Try harder at work and try and

897
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
And you know change this misogynistic

898
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Mainz Athletics

899
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
And so now we're putting such an emphasis to get all these people off of our app if there are any we're hoping there's not

900
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
We now have a whole new set of moderator is looking for

901
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
I hate symbols and Hate

902
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Speech on our platform

903
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136

Powerful

916
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
Thing when you got a hundred million

917
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Billion

918
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
I'll never feel like we've made

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
We we got to just keep going I am mean

920
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
It's funny I used to say to myself

921
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:14,560
When we have 1 million we have 5 million when we have 10

922
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,448
And now we're here and I'm like you know what we always need to evolve and be better and try harder and

Have bigger reach-in better region

00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
I don't know if I call any of those lucky

930
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Feel

931
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
You know

932
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
I think

933
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Luck is probably a certain element but if p

934
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
People think I just you know

935
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
Was at the right place at the right time and just

936
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,568
Stopped my fingers and twirled a couple times

937
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Here's bumble

938
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,920
I mean they're really wrong this is been

939
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,992
We're talking all day everyday

940
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Down

941
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Highs lows and

942
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
And Laser

943
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Focus

944
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
So you guys are still

945
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Really young

946
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Company

947
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Do you

948
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Do you like

949
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Stay up at night

950
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,328
Worrying about a competitor or somebody else

951
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
Coming in and just

952
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Yelp

953
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Totally replacing you

954
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
We

955
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Really truly aren't

956
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
Super worried about competition for 1 re

957
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
I really believe anybody can copy

958
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Product anyone

959
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
I'm at the UT campus

960
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
Speaking to you right now I could go to the engineering school

961
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:42,368
Probably find five really talented young engineers and they can build bumble

962
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
With the right support

963
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
Somebody could rebuild any piece of

964
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Technology

965
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Engineering

966
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
However

967
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
You cannot just copy someone's brand and Beak

968
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Become them

969
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
There has to be

970
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,752
Authenticity when you build a brand and there has to be true purpose

971
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
And so yes you're right

972
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,616
Anybody could go and build a

973
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Competitor version of bumble

974
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,992
But where I don't think they can just come in and and

975
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Sweep us off our feet is

976
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
I don't know if there's another group

977
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
People with the exact same

978
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,672
Story or the exact same

979
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
Mission and motive

980
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
And

981
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
That goes back

982
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
What I lived through that summer of 2014

983
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
What landed on my phone

984
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Every morning

985
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
And it was

986
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
I almost

987
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
Built My

988
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Remedy to

989
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
The the heart

990
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
Ship that I personally was going through end

991
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Bumble safe

992
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,528
Text Whitney Wolfe founder of the dating app

993
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,624
Humble by the way Whitney now goes for the name Whitney Wolfe herd

994
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Because she got married last

995
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
And that's how she met her husband through bumble

996
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,960
Bumble has not yet gone public but a few months ago after reports of a possible IPO

997
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:07,360
Bloomberg intelligence value the company has 1.1 billion dollars

998
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
And please do stick around because in just a moment

999
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
We're going to hear from you

1000
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
About the things

1001
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Your building

1002
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
But first

1003
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
A quick message

1004
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
One of our sponsors

1005
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Smart Water

1006
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Inspired by fresh thinkers

1007
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Stories you're listening to

1008
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Smart water has more ways to hydrate

1009
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,824
Smart Water alkaline 9 + pH

1010
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
SmartWater antioxidant

1011

Added selenium

1012
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Smart Water

1013
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Pretty smart

1014
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Hey thanks so much for

1015
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Sticking around

1016
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,744
I know for how you built that and today we're updating a story from about a year ago

1017
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Turn up the volume for a second because

1018
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
I got the sound that I want to play for you

1019
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Subtle butt

1020
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Think you'll notice

1021
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
Poke a needle scratching

1022
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,992
Which is a kind of a cool sound right full of romance and anticipation especially

1023
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
If you grew up with it

1024
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
And even

1025
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:26,208
If you didn't I started being really interested in records when I was a kid I would go through my parents are Collections and

1026
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
Play Herb Alpert

1027
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,584
Creedence Clearwater Revival

1028
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
When Mike Dixon was

1029
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,728
Was growing up in Wichita Falls Texas was always fascinated with the fact that

1030
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
You had to really interact with the music in a physical way

1031
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,896
The pulled record out of the sleeve put it on the turntable and play it

1032
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:50,528
Is Michael older he started hanging out in clubs and recording some of his friends bands

1033
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,368
And a lot of them wanted to put their songs on vinyl because

1034
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
As we've already established

1035
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Finals kind of cool

1036
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:02,816
But to cut a vinyl record at alleged emit pressing plant is expensive

1037
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,144
Your general investment was about $2,000

1038
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
And if you can sell

1039
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:12,032
500 copies you are definitely not going to break even

1040
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
This time Mike discovered that if you just want to do a really limited run of Records likes

1041
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
Say 20 or 30

1042
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
You can learn to do it yourself

1043
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
Was something called a record lathe

1044
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:27,648
The record Lee it's basically looks like a large turntable

1045
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:33,536
And the needle is vibrating as the disc turns underneath it and the sound wave is etched into the disc

1046
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
And would have seen these old record lives in recording studios or radio stations in the 1940s and 50s

1047
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,800
50s and you can still find them usually in a Dusty Attic or horse

1048
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
On eBay I got really obsessed with the machines I bought everyone that I could find an

1049
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
Eventually I had so many machines I was

1050
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
Having bands

1051
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
From out of town come over to my kitchen and cut record straight for the Lay's in the other room

1052
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
The drummer would be

1053
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Right next to the sink

1054
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,888
The guitar player and bass player would be next to the refrigerator

1055
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,984
And I would be cutting the records while they play the song

1056
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,312
Anyway this is all happening in Olympia Washington

1057
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,920
And in 2010/2011 and I should mention that in real life

1058
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Mike was teaching High School

1059
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,528
But he's also got the spinal record label going

1060
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,856
And eventually he moves out of the kitchen

1061
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
And into a studio and then

1062
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Into the world

1063
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,464
His small events

1064
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Pop-up Fest

1065
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Staples Warehouse

1066
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
He uses his portable record

1067
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
CAD cut vinyl on the spot

1068
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
And then in 2012

1069
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Mike and his partner

1070
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
Got a phone call

1071
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,776
We got a call from Converse

1072
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,360
About cutting records for Bank on the XX at there

1073
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,431

The XX

1076
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,247
Also pretty huge

1077
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,831
Assembly Mike and his partner Chris are at the big party

1078
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
With to record lathe

1079
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Making vinyl dubs of Jamie XX

1080
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
For like

1081
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,559
200 people the attendees would go and listen to some samples

1082
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,679
And they say I want the song of the ace I want the song of the B-side and then we would cut it for them right there

1083
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
And then they walk away with

1084
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
I did ask if they can take home and

1085
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Play and show their friends

1086
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
And after that event

1087
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,431

1088

1096
