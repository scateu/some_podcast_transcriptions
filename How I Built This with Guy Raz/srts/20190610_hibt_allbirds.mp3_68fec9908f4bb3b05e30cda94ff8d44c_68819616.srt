00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
A design school

111
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Which was the subject

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
That it was Sonic

00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
Night we met and so Cincinnati was where I was where I hit it

114
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
And I hadn't visited

115
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903

116
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671

As part of the application they put the mortgage

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471

If I wasn't a pint of Cincinnati's

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711

Hamasaku

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
And what what was

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
What was school like was it intense was it

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,791
It is you're doing soccer for 40 hours a week and school the other the design program was

135
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
It was a five year program

136
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
They wanted to break you down

137
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
And build you up over

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Body is literally

139
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
In a fierce Foundation year

140
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Pounding Piper

141
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Not using computer

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
And literally

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
Going through a very very traditional sort of design education

144
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
And it was difficult because the whole wide world

145
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Department, had the training in the afternoon

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
And I had a studio Avery

147
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Just about every day from 1 to 12 and then

148
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
And I can still remember

149
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
Sprinting across campus

150
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
Changing anodes instruction some agreement with a couch

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Then I can kind of be a little bit

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
The warm-up or something and then

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
I could do this to Dion

154
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079
Somehow made it work but it was it was intense from the beginning

155
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
When I look back on it I did was I was

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Who's the fair men appreciate but I

157
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
I found something

158
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
That I I was in love with

159
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
What was it about

160
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Art and Design

161
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
That connected with you

162
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
It was the it was a solving a problem is I found a place that was

163
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Catch rule for my curiosity

164
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Approaches that I

165
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
It took me a little while but I

166
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
And with the help of a couple days

167
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
This is our realized this was

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
The design was

169
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Was actually not about the

170
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
The output it was a

171
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Prices

172
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Of problems

173
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
And if you applied you could apply

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Thanks

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Alright let's positive for sec

176
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Time in Amarillo

177
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Turn to Joy

178
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Scituate you grew up in in the Bay Area

179
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,559
And when you I mean you know you grew up here and then you end up at Berkeley was a great school but was that was that your

180
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Sort of idea you want to stay in this area you want to go

181
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
I wanted to go to a great place to challenge me

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Want to do engineering

183
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
And I also wanted to try and play soccer

184
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
And so those are the two guiding factors that

185
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
End up leaving me by deduction to get to Berkeley

186
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Were you a good soccer player

187
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
I was all right

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah

189
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
I need a play-by-play to Berkeley as well

190
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
Until I got injured

191
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Great soccer player

192
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
Where are we We Are Tonight go and let go in the alley and end challenge anyway

193
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
Alright see you were you finished Berkeley

194
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
And you

195
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
What what do you want to do with your life at that point if you know

196
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
22

197
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
23 whatever most people don't really know

198
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
Were you thinking maybe a school maybe I'll do

199
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Like that or did you have a sense of what you want to do

200
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
I really didn't

201
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
And then

202
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Simply night I just

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
Latched onto this concept of

204
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Business Consulting with

205
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
It was marketed to me as

206
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
If you don't know what you're doing this is a great way to get a taste for

207
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
A lot of things

208
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
Cuz I got cool that sounds good cuz I definitely don't know what I'm doing

209
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
And so I asked

210
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Went to a couple of

211
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Does little intercessions they have on campus

212
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
And

213
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Doctors company Deloitte

214
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Sounded amazing

215
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
End up jumping into there and did their Consulting Group

216
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
It in a lot of people that we've had and how I built this

217
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Did Consulting work

218
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Mesa

219
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
You know that experience

220
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Consulting with different Industries

221
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
And that sort of how they got their ideas

222
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
What was some of that Consulting work

223
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
You are doing

224
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Tell me my most transformative one

225
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Was I work for

226
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
A client was a garbage

227
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
The garbage company

228
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
Has the second largest garbage company in the country

229
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
And I was

230
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
I looked at fuel

231
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
I'm looking at something esoteric like fuel surcharges yeah

232
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,015
And I was negotiating all these Trucking Fleet contract

233
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
I was literally doing deals in Atlanta

234
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
I would go to a landfill and it would

235
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Every time you walk in and

236
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
The guy was running label. Yep smells like money

237
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
Cuz it would smell really bad but

238
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
That was worth it

239
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Dallas

240
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Business success

241
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
And it was really as really eye-opening it was very Scrappy

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
I know this is something I actually really loved it

243
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
And and I ended up leaving Consulting because I

244
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
That that really early Taste of

245
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Entrepreneurial business

246
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,991
Just got me an ending the berry you almost can't help it Journey kind of like

247
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Dennis Wilson

248
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
I guess mm in

249
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
And I latched onto this concept of

250
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Environmentalism through business

251
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
And using business

252
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
For good

253
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
And doing it for the environment

254
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,423
And so I decided that business will be a good opportunity to

255
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
I kind of refined my interests and help

256
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
Really focus on getting into that sector

257
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
Too I guess you got a pan to the Warren school

258
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
For you I mean

259
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
Was business school like the jewel of business school with business caucus

260
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Sandbox

261
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
You know I'm just going to come up with some ideas and then get out of here and

262
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Yes actually

263
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
I was

264
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,023
Searching with the all the engineering schools in pain

265
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Defined

266
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
Acquainted acquainted company

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
But I can help

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
Take the technology out of the university and start the business

269
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
And then I also got to just

270
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Come out to the West Coast where most of the cleantech

271
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Style of

272
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,479
Business was happening right now it right then it was it was solar-wind biofuels biochemicals

273
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
And that was pick shaping is France 2

274
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
All right so you are

275
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
You graduate

276
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
With an MBA

277
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
And you went and got a job

278
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
With a

279
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Lichen Environmental

280
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Technology

281
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
It back in Bay Area right

282
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Yeah company was called solazyme

283
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
And

284
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Solazyme was

285
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Doing something really unique

286
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
I in the biofuel space they were using microalgae

287
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
And and doing it in a totally different way they were growing this microalgae and

288
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Huge fermentation vessel

289
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
I was

290
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Completely captivated by the

291
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Technology

292
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Division was to basically

293
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
Be there the next source of

294
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Of liquid

295
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
Fuel and chemicals for the entire world you can make oil

296
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Serve a biofuel from algae

297
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Yeah

298
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
You can turn it into fuel

299
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
And it was

300
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
Yeah but actually incredibly high impact for the world if we could get the technology right and get the cost down

301
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Mount it to a place that was

302
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Meaningful what was the response to your

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Your idea

304
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
The response for

305
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
The company was incredible

306
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
And we were

307
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
I joined in 2009

308
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
And

309
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
We ended up going public in 2011

310
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,439
We raised over a billion dollars

311
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Has money for the business

312
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
When it was it was

313
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
It had a legitimate shot of

314
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
Of doing something special

315
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,423
And it got towards the end of my my time there I think I

316
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Linda huge amount about

317
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
What not to do and then ended up I think unequivocally being being a pretty big failure what was the failure

318
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
The entire business

319
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
That they got it it went bankrupt and then it's been acquired since

320
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Spare some of the remnants of the technologist do every

321
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
The investors lost their money on

322
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Lottery

323
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
And you

324
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,511
And other people who made a commitment to that company probably lost

325
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Out as well right cuz you play got some equity and then

326
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
You sure yeah I mean we we

327
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Weird dreams of of Fortune that supposed

328
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
But yeah what what I took away from that experience was

329
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Incredibly rich

330
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
And towards the end of that I started looking around at

331
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Tana difference

332
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Opportunities

333
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
Because I ever find what I want to see you and I and I saw

334
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
What I thought was

335
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,135
The path to make a different kind of a company where the output of that business

336
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Really high

337
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Let's just pause

338
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
First attempt because

339
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
You eventually would graduate from from the University of Cincinnati

340
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
And then you went to

341
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
ASAP Virginia to play soccer professionally semi-professional

342
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Play for a while

343
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
But then you eventually go back

344
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
And play professional soccer in New Zealand

345
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Yeah

346
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
And I found myself

347
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Signed on a multi-year deal to play

348
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Professional sport

349
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
In my hometown

350
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
And I was now part of a New Zealand same that headset

351
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,719
It's Target of qualifying for the World Cup in 2010 and I was I was kind of on my way

352
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
Well I wasn't a quickest when it wasn't my technical

353
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
But I found a White Rock

354
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
How to combat a career that involve me doing a couple things

355
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Really really well

356
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
What were they

357
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Being

358
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Foot and running around a lot

359
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Chicken people

360
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,199
And tackling people and getting a bull off the appliance and giving it to the good Plaza nothing you or Defender

361
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,807
I was a midfielder but I thought you know I kind of a

362
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
What about defensive responsibilities that was about tackling in about aggression in a

363
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
That running around I'm getting a bowl and then it was about scoring goals when you getting lots of penalties called against you

364
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Cuz you don't strike me as an aggressive

365
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Kind of

366
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,263
Guy but I guess the competitiveness with something

367
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,847
Bruns and me whatever it took

368
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
To win

369
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
Bets

370
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,575
You know that was within me and I took a little while to realize that but it was it was there and I was just was competitive

371
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
So you are I mean this is in your circle

372
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Twenties and into your 30s

373
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
How did you think about structure in your life did you think okay I'll play soccer and then I'll get in till I come back to soccer management or something

374
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
What you know about that I was probably starting

375
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Singly focused on this on the sporting career

376
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
And abnormal

377
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Think I'd a good living

378
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,199
My friends that have gone to University and we were getting consulting jobs

379
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Apply for my country

380
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
That means

381
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
We can never have a small group of plaz

382
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
That realize that we have

383
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
Potential Charlotte oil cap

384
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
And if that was the

385
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
The special source

386
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Drive me to kind of

387
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Get through the

388
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,959
The humdrum no retainer professional sport and keep trying and keep improving and keep looking

389
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
Because there was this logic rise here in the slide your sense of purpose

390
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
And the prize was getting to the World Cup in South Africa

391
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
M2010

392
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Yeah formica

393
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
Also the. Your life I guess when you

394
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,063
Start to come up with the idea for what

395
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Would become Auburn

396
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
One of the other cool things that happen

397
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
Is I got a sponsorship.

398
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
From one of the big guy Sports

399
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
And I felt like

400
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
And I could go to the shop and get what I wanted really but I was wearing logos all the time

401
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
And is it I was I was a minimalist

402
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
And I remember still

403
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
My dad broke up

404
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
What's my debit lockpicking logos

405
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Of clothes

406
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
And so the idea that this was

407
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
It was like I said everything that I was wearing her

408
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
It's just like a Swede

409
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Completely

410
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
The antithesis of everything I stood for from

411
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Ingrained to me

412
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
The University of Cincinnati

413
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
And I guess the other thing it was happening

414
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
I just had a

415
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
I had my afternoons

416
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,167
I was training in the morning and I was

417
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Credibly Firestone sport Rite a lot of

418
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
And so

419
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
I started to get curious about

420
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Tequila problem

421
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Articulation

422
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
With the problem of

423
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
The problem of something simple

424
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
It was impossible

425
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Dafont and a New Zealand it was sort of

426
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Just like a nice slip on Earth

427
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Like a lights up sneaker

428
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Rite Aid ahead logos on it

429
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Will you boy

430
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Keyboard

431
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Chuck Taylor

432
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Brighton was there wasn't too much

433
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
And Chuck Taylors

434
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
The great Butternut super comfy it was it was one of those ones

435
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
I just saw a problem that was

436
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
It was mine I didn't write a business plan

437
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
And something off season one of my soccer Seasons I want to side with the

438
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
2008

439
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
2015 of the year will you kind of go off

440
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Open your wrist

441
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
What sound Factory

442
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Online

443
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
And I went and visited one

444
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Where was it in Indonesia

445
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
So you are serious you were like

446
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,047
But I know I'm going to go build a comfortable shoe it wasn't about comforter

447
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Design

448
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
It was a design observation about

449
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Category

450
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Complicated

451
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
I've cried enough

452
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
You just said I want to make a shoe

453
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
That's a server high top

454
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
Like a Chuck Taylor without logos yeah I'm going to I'm going to go do it

455
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
It was that simple

456
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
And I tried to do a New Zealand and realize that

457
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Extra long suit

458
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Disappeared from

459
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
Nobody

460
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
And so I said walk I will it scar

461
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
See if we can do this

462
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
And I greatly

463
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:15,935
Underestimated as I'm sure Joey would have kissed how complicated it is actually to make a shoe by the way did you know how to sew a mean

464
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
I learned that you didn't learn that design school

465
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,871
But you make patterns you cut them out like you didn't have a sense of how to draw rings

466
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Justice for

467
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
And I had photos of

468
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Other examples

469
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Shoes that I thought

470
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Close

471
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
But that was a

472
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
And I thought

473
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
We could go

474
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Make this I think if

475
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
If you could make it you could sell it

476
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
And this potentially

477
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
The business

478
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
And it started to

479
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Get really really interested in this idea

480
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Entrepreneurialism

481
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,007
Building a business of making things this is why your ass while you're still a soccer player

482
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
And I'm kind of

483
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
ABC and fox I mean on the World Cup

484
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,503
Everything was training was thought that was that was not ran through it myself but this was my mean to escape

485
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,111
Did this was in 2009 you would not actually really start to make a shoe

486
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,975
Like 5 more years later which will get to know I'm not not really

487
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,559
I might shoot straight away you made sure you straight away and I saw them to my team

488
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
Okay so we'll see you made them at this Factory

489
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
Rihanna Shut Up and

490
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
1000

491
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
So you actually put

492
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,639
All your cash into the splits and my brother was helping

493
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
With some of the selling

494
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
What were they made out of

495
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
Canvas and let you know some Lita

496
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,575
Some New Zealand later I was tripping other again

497
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,183
Another Riot an experience where I walked into a Tannery for the first time and started to understand why

498
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
How bad that

499
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Materials

500
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
Write all the chemicals that go into the leather leather right and just understand just generally

501
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Just

502
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,959
You know where these materials were coming from a ring of the samples would come

503
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And you left in the Box I would smell like

504
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
And I think that opened up the idea of exploring differ

505
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Materials

506
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
What were your shoes called

507
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,479
It's a particular time I think the name was

508
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
With my initials

509
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
To be

510
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,623
And any idea was a no logo shoe that was comfortable

511
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Made out of canvas

512
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
Different styles of the hardtop on a laptop

513
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
And I sold it to my teammates

514
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
For like

515
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
4T boxer laws

516
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Made them peifu cross

517
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
And I

518
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
150 box fans

519
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:30,847
So you sold it but you could have sold 1000 pairs we did it we did a pop-up shop in Wellington and you know

520
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
I think it was the beginning of

521
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,991
Of an interest in this category in the process of selling

522
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
I'm selling the shoes the design story was

523
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Was one part of it I think it reside with people

524
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
But it needed something more buy for me and for

525
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Product the flight was okay

526
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
But it wasn't

527
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
It wasn't differentiate

528
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
And you know I think I remember reading a magazine one day

529
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
About the wool industry in New Zealand and we'd actually we put some wolfelt experimented on some wolf out on the outside of sunburst

530
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
How's it going

531
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,687
Which was wool not used in shoes

532
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
What if we could do that

533
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
That would be hugely

534
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
So I can die with the help of

535
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Of

536
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Some friends of the time put together a ground on a whim

537
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,280
To develop a wool and textile

538
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Faithful to making the upper of a shoe that apply to the New Zealand government

539
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
It was

540
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
To research how you could turn wool into shoes

541
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
22 actually Mike

542
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Because it didn't exist

543
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,456
And you know I think the backdrop in the context around this was the easy on 45 and What's a shape

544
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:45,856
It's a hugely important Legacy industry in New Zealand that is going through a really really tough

545
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Tough time

546
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
And do not think that

547
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,976
That was searching for new ideas

548
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
And you categories and it was kind of right time right place with a

549
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
A random maybe obvious idea

550
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
That haven't been done before in and we got lucky and so

551
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Probably around the world couple of before this ground

552
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Research lab in Christchurch

553
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
Set about trying to make a fabric

554
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
All of this is happening

555
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
At the same time that your team is is

556
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,600
Finally qualified for the World Cup qualified

557
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
David Wilcox the first time in 1982 and the 2nd, 2010 so that was a big deal

558
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
We're undefeated

559
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
The only undefeated team that will count

560
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Because

561
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
We drew three times and didn't get out of that

562
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Has Spain won the World Cup

563
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
And it was

564
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
That was an enormous at

565
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
And this was an easy one thing that I mean was ranked

566
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,664
The smallest nation of the world cop we were the lowest rank

567
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
And we went in there and

568
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
I mean even to qualify was a norm

569
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,112
Conversation

570
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880

598
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
When when Lindsay Cameron and introduced us to Tim

599
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,904
I thought it was pretty good but you guys have met

600
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
But you were doing your own thing he was

601
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Playing soccer in

602
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
You started a nice guy

00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Retire from football

605
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,216
Play soccer and then I realized

606
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
This is this is

607
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,104
Where are you at the park scene

608
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
And

611
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
I did this time

612
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
The idea of

613
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,832
Going back to school and studying all the subjects that I'd avoided was interesting and I

614
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
How do I want to go back to London where I was born and where my father was Froman

615
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
So do I deserve being able

616
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Go back there

617
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
And study was was

618
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
By the way out of sporting some ways in the best of Wisin

619
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,656
I know and ended the opportunity to kind of step back and

620
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
And stop this

621
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
So you decide to do a

622
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Degree

623
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
At London School of economics

624
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,152
With this idea for a shoe in your mind

625
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Yeah

626
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
And a little bit of shoemaking also

627
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
Troubleshooting

628
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
And I showed up and and and did the

629
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
This couple semesters and I will say your name

630
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Went off to Kellogg

631
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Northwestern

632
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,792
And you are able to take the pic of classes

633
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Now that you want the truth

634
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
The quarter that you or the other.

635
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Are you there

636
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
ISO shop at Evanston and I walk into

637
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
An entrepreneurship class

638
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
With a physical card cost

639
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,128
Who is a former CEO of walmart.com in this

640
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
Pretty a special purpose of the air

641
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
And

642
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
He sent an email out he said everyone

643
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Hestia coming

644
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
And that you've got

645
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
3 minutes to pitch an idea to the class

646
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
And we will

647
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
Form teams around the Beastie no ideas and for the whole

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
You have court are you

649
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Yoga Loft

650
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
This business idea by pitch the idea of Wu shoes

651
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
And I think people thought it was a little bit of a jack

652
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
Yeah but for whatever reason it got selected

653
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
And I found myself a list

654
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
3 months

655
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Penis idea

656
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
I'm truly

657
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Actually building us into a business

658
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
This idea of wool shoes which

659
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
What you'd really been touring with Sam 2009

660
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
An hour around 2012-2013

661
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
It's

662
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Starting to get some traction

663
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Yeah but but I wonder I mean

664
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Was anyone saying like

665
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
How do you turn

666
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
A scratchy wool into

667
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
And 2 shoes

668
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Everyone

669
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Sid

670
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
But there was something about the idea

671
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
That people sit on you but how did you describe it to

672
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
People because I'm saying to you

673
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Tim

674
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,856
I don't get it like I here's my wool sweater how do I translate that into shoes

675
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
How would you describe

676
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
I will fish delight I realized that wool

677
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Scratch

678
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
So what's up

679
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Copamarina

680
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Okay is a different sheet

681
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
It's okay and it's a fine material on software

682
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,240
And then you will have to talk about not just the material you acted

683
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Benefits of Massage

684
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
So what

685
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
Are you going to do this there must be a reason and the reason is

686
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Because will has leaves

687
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Miraculous properties

688
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Any people

689
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
What it is as much as people kind of

690
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,160
Loft the idea this has been a consistent thread I think on some level they so to see

691
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
That's interesting

692
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
And try goatee into that course and

693
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,656
To London Austin my time at Kellogg and decided I was going to watch washers on Kickstarter

694
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Okay but so

695
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
To do something on Kickstarter what you did in 2014 but to do some have Kickstarter

696
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,872
You need to have the Prototype you need to have

697
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
A lot of things

698
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
Had you what it what was it what was it

699
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
We called called allbirds

700
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,368
No it was a decide renamed it again and it took another crack at 9 then it was cool three out of seven

701
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
And it was going to be very very

702
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,952
Simple design original

703
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
And and we can be made out of wool with us

704
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
The humans rights Kickstarter

705
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,936
You start the promise people that you're going to deliver them the shoe factory on Google

706
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Where was it in Portugal this time

707
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
And I flown over and was a tiny Victory and I'd made I think

708
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
I was eight pills of samples

709
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,712
And I went home to New Zealand for Christmas

710
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
I shut up

711
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,344
I needed to shoot a video with my Dad's friend

712
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Do I dye a sheep farm

713
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Just outside of Wellington

714
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,024
We have one day to do this and my dad's

715
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816

716
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864

718
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
About the shape so they could be in the backdrop of this video and

719
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
I very nearly pulled out

720
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,872
I was running this script and I just it was one of those moments you think this is dumb

721
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
And my brother

00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
Literally drag me along to the farm

And said you stood what's the worst that can happen

724
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
And so we went we went ahead with it and shut up

725
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
Show the video of an ultimately

Driving to the NPR politics podcast

00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Welcome back to how I built this

820
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
PR

R Kickstarter

825
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
And people respond right away they raised 120

826
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Thousand

827
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Just a few

828
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Few days

829
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,720
What you mean is that Tim now needs to get to work fast

830
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
To start filling orders

831
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,376
Had a couple young guys cuddle with information We Found Love spicing

832
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
In London and

833
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
You know I spent probably the worst year

834
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,288
Trying to make this thing happen

835
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Every mistake you can imagine

836
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
And I remember that

837
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,992
Vista Factory at the young guy he gone over the sector Nicole me at 1 to any guys we got a problem

838
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,088
The sector has made the men's and women's shoes exactly the same sauce

839
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:38,048
That's bet there's like a one-and-a-half this could be different sure where we going to do we got no choice

840
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Going to have to just

841
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
We just have to send it out

842
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,472
Joey you are a customer that Kickstarter campaign

843
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
I was I was one of the lucky customers who order two men standing at a women's 10

844
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
And it was fine

845
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
I know it was not fun

846
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
I was pretty bad I didn't you

847
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
When I when I 10 customer service

848
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Which was

849
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Tim Brown

850
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
It is recommended that I take out the insole make a little room more room for myself Seth wow and since you didn't have any more while there was no

851
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
No exchanges or anything like that

852
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,168
Can you play something to me when you make $120,000

853
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Kickstarter

854
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Amazing it's a lot of

855
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Cash

856
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
It probably did not pay

857
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,872
For all of the origins of a film

858
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
Was financially

859
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,504
And so I was tapping into my my savings at work

860
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
Rapidly dwindling at the time and

861
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Living in London in

862
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
And then right at the end of that we sort of

863
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
The factory in Portugal

864
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Tom decided to go bankrupt

865
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,072
Right at the end of this shortly after we just delivered a study idea that we were going to come

866
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352

Oldest business in Gulfport to the next phase of

868
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,776

869
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
10 oz of watermelon

870
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
From Effexor

871
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
Okay when you finished

872
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Fulfilling his orders

873
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Were you like

874
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Okay now I've got it

875
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Create a business or you likes

876
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Or you like I'm done with

877
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
I just kind of summer in between

878
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,672
And I did that that year was

879
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
Was awful and it was

880
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
I would find myself at dinners

881
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,888
With woodlands and her friend to a kind of hoodies now at the stage of the career with things are starting to

882
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
To take off in that

883
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
And we got the dinner to go around the table and I would

884
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
I just have a drink when I would

885
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
Come to me and see what else what I was doing

886
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,736
Lunch with Mike unplug my body would kill up into a little bowl and I was so excited whooshes and

887
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
When we leave the dental people pet me on the head and say that's

888
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Lovely

889
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,672
Sing this little thing and good luck with that little fella run it was just it was it was

890
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
It became clear to the

891
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
Doing it by yourself

892
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Really hot

893
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,120
And that I was good at some aspects of it and there's a bunch of things that are blue

894
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
You know you're doing your

895
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,032
Call your friend a favor and just wants to pour them

896
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,104
But I have to imagine that at least initially you're not thinking

897
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,200
This is what I want to do I want to leave my job and go do this or right

898
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
If you asked me at the time I would have left you

899
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,064
Usmes. I'm just going to support this

900
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,440
I did think it was it was really cool and I mean

901
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:18,048
Looking back at that video as I as I once in awhile do when we're chilling

902
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
New employees not all birds

903
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
A lot of the things that Tim

904
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Intuitively

905
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,240
Shaw and talked about in that video

906
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
Are exactly the same things that

907
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
We talked about today and I think

908
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Are Tim is tennis one of those

909
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Unbelievable intuitive marketers

910
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Connect with

911
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
With people and understands what is missing in the market and

912
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
And that was clear from I think they won

913
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Sir Tim I read that

914
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
After the kickstarter

915
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
Android ndk

Fulfill those orders

917
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
You're kind of exhaust

918
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560

00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Mymercy

921
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Do with it

922
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,216
This thing you were contacted by an investor

923
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Who said hey

924
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
Fitness on here would you let me buy into this

925
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,408
I found myself on a plane to New York speaking with someone from within the

926
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
The world who had seen the traction and

927
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
The product and liked it

928
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:16,160
Locked it and I went and you can spend a lot of time in the movie three aspects of it and they put out they put a deal in front of

929
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,792
And that must have been pretty gratifying me I have to assume you were getting a little bit nervous about your Finance

930
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
Situations are there putting a dollar figure in front of you must have been

931
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
Quite nice I was starting to think

932
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
What do I do next

933
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
I've been through this really difficult year and I was like what

934
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Why am I doing

935
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,896
Making whooshes what was this evening

936
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,760
Answers through my mind and we get to simatai

937
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
Enough

938
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Do understand the deal

939
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,000
But you better that it was complicated was, and how much time did you have before you

940
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,072
Does things on the table and

941
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
And Lindsay

942
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Chic

943
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,656
She goes you need to speak with you about this

944
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
He comes from this world he's

945
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
He's a customer of the project

946
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Piano

947
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
He be an interesting person to circle the Sun

948
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,408
And so and so I didn't even want to give me the

949
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
10 minutes

950
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
It's good and it's bad and you don't really have

951
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Anything else

952
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:21,184
Do you want to show us around yeah can you give me a rough sense of what they're offering you

953
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
It was

954
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
It was some upfront capital

955
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
That would convert to equity

956
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
Depending on how the business performed

957
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Involve car moving to New York

958
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
And I wouldn't

959
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
A big chunk with a large large chunk of

960
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
Majority of the majority

961
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,872
And see if he left with like

962
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
2015 something like that

963
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
And so Jojo

964
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Took a look at this thing for me and

965
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
They jumped on the phone and he hasn't just look

966
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
He

967
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,744
I'd really really good friends close friends that it looked at the caudal up to that yeah

968
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
Heat gun for

969
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
What did you think when you saw it

970
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
I thought

971
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,168
Yeah I didn't think that

972
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,520
There was any ill intent from the from the guys here except the deal but it was

973
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
It was vulturous

974
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
In the way

975
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
After I read it

976
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
And I thought that it was taking

977
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,528
Advantage of a great idea and trying to sink their talons into

978
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
Into this business and

979
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
It what 10 would have been left with was not

980
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Great Tso

981
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Did I told him at that time I was like

982
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,000
Like luck I wouldn't take the deal and I wouldn't

983
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Run the business this way

984
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
But what was his alternative

985
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
I said that time I looked at it this is the moment and in my life to that I'd been at Souls on for 6 years yeah

986
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
And

987
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
I had a very consistent experience

988
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
And I mean I cannot look back and laugh a little bit now like algae oil kind of sounds like the pill like 2,000 version of

989
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Snake oil salesman

990
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
But I was

991
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
Big multinationals and chemical companies

992
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Big brands

993
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,744
And there was like a couple of these just Seminole moments where I would

994
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:05,120
I would have an idea I would go talk to the right people you'd want to talk to if you had an amazing new material

995
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
That happened to be really sustainable for the Atlantic

996
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
I pitched it in had multiple meetings

997
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,080
And everyone at first is like I'm soup this is amazing

998
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,664
Exciting idea wheel of the sustainability mission

999
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
And then you got okay well let's do this you

1000
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
And then it turns to like this

1001
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Really

1002
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,624
Inane sourcing conversation where they're like

1003
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,976
Just do what we do now do it cheaper like we don't really like we don't really care about the sustainability Park

1004
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,560
Is is not the words they use but that's the sentiment that's conveyed

1005
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
And so I just realized it is

1006
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
Super frustrating experience that

1007
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,496
Dip Brands big Brands they said they cared about sustainability

1008
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,824
But in reality they were just paying lip service to the idea

1009
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,896
I'm sitting here and Tim comes with this

1010
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
Not just a concept but like a pretty

1011
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Flushed out idea with

1012
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Kickstarter success

1013
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Really resonated with me from a sustainability

1014
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Perspective

1015
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,928
But it was also about an opportunity to

1016
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,256
Sell shoes in a totally different way than the industry had

1017
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Never done before

1018
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Okay so

1019
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
You see this term sheet

1020
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,960
The gears start turning in your head Joey while you're thinking wait a minute

1021
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
This actually

1022
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
There's some

1023
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Legs to this thing

1024
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
And actually maybe I can talk to

1025
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Tim about

1026
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,480
Sort of using this shoe idea as a vehicle for

1027
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Sustainability

1028
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Yeah I read

1029
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,368
How to spell cradle-to-cradle I remember the intro chapter

1030
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
I talked about one of the scourges of the Earth

1031
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
On pollution in the environment being

1032
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
The Shield

1033
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
The number of shoes and Anna

1034
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
20 billion Paris

1035
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
The shoes that are made every year

1036
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
In the us alone

1037
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
The average American kid woman

1038
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Man this

1039
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Day by 8

1040
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Paris per year

1041
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Per person

1042
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
That's two and a half billion just the US

1043
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
It's all these things are sitting in land

1044
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
And until what you put into

1045
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
The chemicals in that any material that used to produce it

1046
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
AR

1047
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,903
They're incredibly important and no one's thinking of

1048
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
And so

1049
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Yeah the gear started trying little bit and I started thinking more and an ear look timing is everything

1050
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,447
I asked him but my family I had I had to really young kids

1051
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Did the time

1052
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,567
And lives in and my kids were gone for the weekend and I asked him

1053
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
If you wanted to fly out

1054
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
From London

1055
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
And and just talked about the concept

1056
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
To see if

1057
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,063
If he give it another go and maybe we could work together we can work together

1058
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
Yeah what you think about that

1059
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
I jumped on the plane

1060
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,487
And I flew out to San Francisco

1061
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
And I'm enjoying all spent the week waiting to get any pick me up at the airport

1062
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Listen 2015

1063
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,263
This is in an early 2015 and we spend we spend

1064
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
The Weeknd

1065
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Getting

1066
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Getting a little bit drunk and and talkin about a families and getting to know each other and walking in the house of Miranda and really Justice

1067
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,063
What am I do like to work together and try to understand if that would be a good idea or not

1068
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
So did you resolve that weekend

1069
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
Try this out to make it go up

1070
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
By and large yeah

1071
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
Atlanta back in London I found the person to do it with

1072
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,935
Why did you think he was the person to do

1073
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
I think I found a guy

1074
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
That

1075
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,871
On the surface was very very different from me but maybe

1076
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
On the night shift a lot of

1077
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,503
Similarities in terms of attitude and approach

1078
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
What sound

1079
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,599
Maybe I kindred spirit ends of

1080
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
Competitiveness

1081
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,743
Which we both said that I thought that was an attractive

1082
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
I think I found someone that could do all the parts of the business that I shouldn't be doing and and that we potentially

1083
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
Could be a great grandpa

1084
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,567
Can I ask you guys then this is important cuz a lot of people to listen to show

1085
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,895
The cofounders are two people involved

1086
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,735
And a big part of the show is Lessons Learned

1087
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Write as a roadmap

1088
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
Can you walk me through the

1089
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:14,719
I don't know if it was difficult I don't know if it was uncomfortable or unpleasant the conversation the two of you had to have

1090
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
When you decided how you were going to structure

1091
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
This company because you've been working on this

1092
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
And you had this idea but

1093
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Just actually take

1094
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Tim's idea but

1095
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
To turn it into a

1096
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
Totally sustainable

1097
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Harbin

1098
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
Free carbon-neutral

1099
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Product which will get

1100
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,199
Cheap you're both coming in with big ideas

1101
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
How do you divide the company of

1102
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
I needed that

1103
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Do that very quickly in and very simply

1104
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Ivory MO

1105
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,951
I think the important part that we both understood was that

1106
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,047
We doing this alone and become an experienced it for a while

1107
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
Doing it alone is

1108
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Really lonely

1109
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
And I'd always been of the opinion that

1110
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,031
I was going to do a business I wanted to do it with someone cuz I I knew my shortcomings were

1111
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Substantial

1112
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
And then I would much rather have

1113
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
A piece

1114
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Something big

1115
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Then

1116
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Lot of something

1117
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Lakes Mall

1118
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,623
And so it what you know and I think he respected what I was going to bring to the table

1119
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
I'm particularly the future that doesn't say it wasn't

1120
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,487
End up being a reasonably

1121
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
Reasonably quick conversation and I think

1122
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
Neither of us have I really look back at least I should Landon left back and never regretted that so you're dividing up 100% of some

1123
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215
Something worth noting

1124
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
At that point which is always

1125
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Challenge because you never know what

1126
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
What's going to happen in the future

1127
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
And then you both

1128
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
Decide you are

1129
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Going to both

1130
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Be the CEO

1131
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
Yeah you know we we

1132
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
But I was having a lot of the conversation

1133
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
The financial community

1134
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
And

1135
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
Yeah you going until like someone's office

1136
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
Like okay that's awesome but can I talk to

1137
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Yeah right

1138
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
Cheddar's at Yale first London

1139
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:02,495
Jason London he's also he's also doing other kinds of conversations that would be an N subsequently we knew that

1140
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Press

1141
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
Like talking to Media was going to be relieved

1142
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
At Tim is going to go have a media conversation

1143
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Cute like

1144
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
They would also want to talk to the CEO was just

1145
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,575
And we both knew what each other prior

1146
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,135
Something really special to the table

1147
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
That the other one

1148
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Didn't didn't ring

1149
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
And now and said that it wasn't just a semantic

1150
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
Title it was really

1151
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Actually

1152
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
The fundamental contribution

1153
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,263
Warranted that kind of split responsibilities that summer

1154
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,847
A 2015 you're pounding the pavement Joey trying to raise money

1155
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,687
How much money did you think you needed to raise to get this thing

1156
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
We at yeah we did our little business plan which is remarkably inaccurate but we

1157
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,951
But we decided that we needed a million and a half dollars

1158
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,767
And we felt like that could get us through

1159
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
Huge amount of

1160
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,631
Marketing branding work in the beginning and then

1161
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
Buy a whole bunch of em

1162
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Inventory and we wanted to buy a lot of

1163
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
We have this mentality of

1164
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:11,103
If we are going to do this we are going to fail Superfast or succeed really big

1165
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,431
And so the idea from the beginning was direct

1166
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
To Consumer you were going to

1167
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
Have a big marketing campaign to attract people to the website

1168
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:23,135
And you were going to have the shoes in a warehouse and then you could just shut them out

1169
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Yep

1170
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,487
Basically that we were going to launch simultaneously in the US

1171
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
And New Zealand on

1172
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Just website

1173
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
And did you have a date in mind

1174
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
We did

1175
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
March 1st 2016

1176
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
Wow and you were working out of your house

1177
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,775
And my mother-in-law's apartment okay in in Marin

1178
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:46,175
Tim you're wrapping up in London preparing to move to California to get married on June 6th 2015

1179
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
Then to move to California, California

1180
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
OKC

1181
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
You spend

1182
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Basically a

1183
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Full-year

1184
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Raising money from investors

1185
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,047
And perfecting the design and in doing everything you need to do to create this

1186
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Turbo lands

1187
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Sustainable

1188
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Wushu

1189
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
What was your

1190
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Game plan

1191
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
What do you do with a

1192
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
We will

1193
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
We had to build the brand

1194
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,847
We had a quarter instrumental

1195
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:20,479
Conversation with a guy who has previously been on the show called Eric Ryan from

1196
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
Sweet would sit down with a movie sit High we want to build a different type of

1197
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
Who is Brandon we believe this

1198
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
Probably solve and we can make

1199
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
The shoes that I

1200
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,231
They're more comfortable that a bit for the environment

1201
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
Zeppelin what do you think

1202
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
He said to us

1203
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Fantastic

1204
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
Taipei seoul

1205
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
On the back

1206
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
Just get on with doing it

1207
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,847
People that buy sustainable products that bike right products

1208
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,687
And the only reason for you to do this

1209
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,735
Is because the rest of the world

1210
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,527
Far behind with I need to

1211
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,343
And get on with doing it

1212
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
And and Doug Mike

1213
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,671
Sustainability of hotteebrand mic

1214
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Make the attributes of

1215
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
The product of the sustainable materials the story

1216
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
So you you thought Comfort was wavering

1217
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Comfort was the weather

1218
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
It was the problem to be solved

1219
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,287
And we were going to solve Comfort through sustainable materials that and I believe that Comfort experience but we're also better for the environment

1220
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
You Know What It Seems

1221
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
It seems obvious yet comforters

1222
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,687
People buy shoes in

1223
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
And

1224
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
Comfort often is equated with

1225
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
Ugliness fu

1226
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
Dad tells you he's got a couple pair of shoes you should know that look very good

1227
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
Said you were bringing great design and pairing it with that

1228
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
Shaving the Comfort through materials that will

1229
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
What's a better for the environment

1230
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
It is really kind of the

1231
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,399
Northstar for the business

1232
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
By the way how did you get the name

1233
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
Git branch show me a lot of different names

1234
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
And ultimately

1235
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,943
Landed on ubereats is a sort of this

1236
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Whimsical encapsulation of

1237
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
Hope the type of business that we wanted to build

1238
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
Fisk Avenue Zeeland was it was nothing there but birds was Robards so I was a little nod to the pro

1239
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
Provenance of the story Inn

1240
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:13,375
And the idea that we should trade more lightly in the in the white that ended that we might products

1241
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Yeah

1242
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,471
And so we chose that and Joey procure the.com

1243
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
And we were we were

1244
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,847
So you launched on March

1245
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
My fresh

1246
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
March 1st 2018

1247
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,551
The big red button or Saturday ride bike riding outfit you launch it the website goes live

1248
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
What happened to your inventory

1249
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
Yeah we saw through it really fast

1250
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
And where were you holding at inventory

1251
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
We had a warehouse in Connecticut at the time

1252
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
And we sold through

1253
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
Within I think

1254
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
A week and a half we started having

1255
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,519
Sizes that were sold out and you did all this Lake was shopify's weekend ya ya te technology enable let's do this

1256
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,335
It's really late today are

1257
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Yeah yeah

1258
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
It's the thing yeah we started

1259
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:02,783
Direct-to-consumer as a concept has been around for awhile but the technology has

1260
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,343
Developed and so it allowed us to

1261
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,695
Take advantage of things quite inexpensive life from from that infrastructure that that stuff

1262
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
I mean that's amazing cuz anyone can use it

1263
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
Colleges available to anyone

1264
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Affordable

1265
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,887
Salesforce technology Shopify all this stuff is out there

1266
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:23,007
In some ways that the barriers to entry to the launching a new business of Nevada

1267
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
And others

1268
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
And otherwise it's it's never been more competitive

1269
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,407
But certainly you know we were able to do that

1270
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Reasonably easily

1271
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
You lunch and you just start

1272
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Selling out

1273
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Fast

1274
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Was that

1275
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,903
Incredibly exciting or did that create

1276
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
New

1277
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Kinds of stress

1278
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
It was weird

1279
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
Who's like

1280
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,119
Neither of us would have said that we are like really successful

1281
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
At that point

1282
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
And

1283
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,847
In some ways it was great like obviously it's certainly better than not selling any issues set up so don't get me wrong I mean

1284
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
Like 15000 parisot that was a lot

1285
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,735
And then we start selling through really fast

1286
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
And then we

1287
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
Both found herself

1288
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
Acting strange

1289
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
This

1290
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:16,255
Is that you was like letting the air out of a balloon it was like to eat you have this unbelievably stressful 7/8 months of

1291
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
Of of working for this

1292
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
Singular creative piece

1293
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
This product

1294
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
And then you put it out there and just see what happens

1295
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
End

1296
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
It worked

1297
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
Ostensibly yunnan people

1298
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,079
15000 or close to that that bought it

1299
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:34,175
And then we're sitting there like okay the stress is gone now is like

1300
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
Maybe we like had too much of a Swagger

1301
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,295
And like I think it was funny like that

1302
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
The most successful X on the outside

1303
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
Maybe you look on the inside

1304
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,999
Especially where we were probably maybe at one of our worst moments as a partnership

1305
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Why

1306
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,863
I think we just started you know we started

1307
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
Maybe I was probably

1308
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,471
Getting over my skis and talking about things in design

1309
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
And maybe Tim was

1310
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,359
Doing some things in in the area of the business that I was Stronger at that

1311
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,919
That that maybe you shouldn't have been

1312
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
And we we were at we were like hey

1313
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
This work like

1314
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Step off

1315
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,623
Test memory it weird with a beer

1316
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
I must be like

1317
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
At the end of March

1318
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,535
30 31 days

1319
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
And we

1320
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,143
We got a million dollars in sales in the first month I mean it was it was crazy

1321
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
And with no way we didn't

1322
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,239
We think we

1323
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,799
We blew through our

1324
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
First-year business plan

1325
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
Kardashian and like

1326
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
WeChat

1327
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
Really short amount of time

1328
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,991
So we were

1329
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039
Beyond any

1330
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,671
Doubt that it was it was working and we're having this beer and we're like both eyes watering up

1331
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
And

1332
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
Ayye

1333
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,303
Yeah I don't like how this is going

1334
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,631
It was one of those moments where we then,

1335
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,935
Fell back on the promise we made

1336
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Kylie to our wives

1337
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
About not ruining their

1338
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
Relationship in

1339
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,639
The fact that if we were going to make something successful it was going to take two of us

1340
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,479
And we got to work on this and and this is more important then

1341
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,367
Whether we sell out the next color whatever because from the outside as you say you would have thought oh man this

1342
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
Because crushing it great job

1343
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:26,559
But this is really want attention begins it was. It was at that moment it's funny it has

1344
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:34,239
Through the Journey and then they usually they usually linked up from the outside when we had that we've had the most success

1345
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,567
Whenever I mow to be high-fiving in

1346
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,895
We had a moment and it was I don't think we'd get found a kind of a

1347
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
A mechanism

1348
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
The Carnegie

1349
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,991
To get stuff

1350
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
I think we just been working and I saw beside he drowned and you know it if it's the joke about

1351
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,959
Pretty deep and we found ways to sort of like

1352
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Purge the system

1353
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
And reset the machine

1354
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
And

1355
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,455
By the time that kind of came out in it and a little bit of an avalanche of

1356
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
What kind of motion in

1357
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Cognizant

1358
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
And I you know I think it was we realized

1359
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,623
That we needed to manage this more effectively

1360
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
That our relationship

1361
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Would be

1362
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
As important as the strategy

1363
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:32,351
Yeah is as important as many of the things we were doing that in that needed to be

1364
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,143
He worked on market like any healthy

1365
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:39,263
And it's also there's a directness in our relationship that

1366
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
We don't have that

1367
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
At like

1368
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
You can't just

1369
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,151
Can just talk about superficial business

1370
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,991
Cast that are doing wrong or right like it you know where like

1371
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Did

1372
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
This is not good

1373
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,671
Like it's going to be a different direction for us to work this out with

1374
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
And at

1375
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,535
I'm just getting to the heart of issue not letting it calcify it's it's

1376
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
Give it no time

1377
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:09,215
Nip it in the bud and move on and have super low ego about it and I think our personalities

1378
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
NRI respect for one another is what kind of

1379
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:16,127
Lends itself to allowing that strategy to work and might not be for everyone

1380
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,503
What's a Nae just a self-generating Thing Once you launch

1381
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,551
Suspicion is

1382
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
It was just after the race

1383
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
It's like

1384
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:32,767
You were getting more attention than you getting celebrities wearing it and Gayle King telling Oprah you got to try these on and

1385
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,071
Play Barack Obama wears an I mean

1386
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:40,703
Is that what happened what it did just continue to cut a snowball on its own and obviously

1387
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Did Media stuff but

1388
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,287
Are or was ever a moment

1389
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
White wedges

1390
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,847
Service slow down you said okay

1391
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
I don't know

1392
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,711
Yeah I don't think there's like a single moment but there was there was moments

1393
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,295
Xian August the front page of the New York Times

1394
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Get on the

1395
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:02,975
Front page of the business section everyone

1396
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Shoes and

1397
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
That catalyzes a bunch of attention and then

1398
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Hey get a moment like

1399
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,655
Smashing Gayle King's a lot in the media

1400
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,703
And I think

1401
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:17,567
We just gave it time to you know we we didn't sell we sold one

1402
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,359
Style the wall Runner

1403
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
14 months

1404
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,967
Did we win do anything else except the wall Runner

1405
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
And I think that

1406
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
It's hard to create new doubt about what you stand for

1407
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
If you have just one product

1408
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:35,487
I got helps you in and it just being methodical and intentional about that

1409
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,535
Not taking advice from people who said

1410
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,143
Turn it out faster drop more colors drop more Styles you know

1411
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
You guys

1412
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Have

1413
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
You guys are a b Corporation

1414
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,895
People don't know what that is essentially means you commit to certain sustainability practices and and

1415
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,479
The way you serve treat your employees and compensation Etc

1416
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,087
It's a big thing you know you talked about the materials that are used for the shoes

1417
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,623
I know Joey you were

1418
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
Very influenced by

1419
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Sustainability

1420
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
Let's talk about this for a moment I mean you're still

1421
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,863
You got to get the wool from New Zealand it's got to be spun into

1422
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,703
This material then made into shoes in a factory that is probably

1423
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,495
You know using electricity

1424
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,311
And then put on ships and then sent all

1425
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Over the world

1426
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
Is it possible to make

1427
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,199
A carbon-neutral

1428
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,039
Shoot is that possible with with all those things I've just

1429
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Describe

1430
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,087
Yeah it is

1431
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
We're not there yet

1432
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,695
And I think we when we started this business we had a really

1433
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Clear

1434
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
Ikea

1435
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
We wanted to be

1436
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Wanted to be like a tree

1437
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
You wanted to suck carbon out and spit out oxygen

1438
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
We want to be back yet

1439
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
And we knew we were we were quite a ways from

1440
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
That ambition

1441
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
But

1442
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,543
In the problem of climate change is that

1443
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
Businesses pollute

1444
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
And

1445
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
And Society pays for that

1446
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,479
Yep the companies don't pay for it and that's the problem

1447
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
And so we've we believe that we should pay for it

1448
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,831
And so

1449
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:11,231
We have committed to be carbon neutral and the

1450
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,375
Across all the dimensions that you said from transportation to the electric grid that the factories were in Korea because

1451
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,935
How much cleaner grad than other places in the world

1452
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:26,335
Sure but we still we still have emissions in in the way that we make the shoe and transport it and ship it to

1453
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Customers for e-commerce

1454
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,687
Until we pay for a paper offsets for the remainder of that

1455
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:37,087
Natural bridge the gap between the idealism and the practicalities of so where the rubber meets

1456
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:41,951
The proverbial Road despite your idealism despite your commitment to

1457
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
Creating this

1458
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:48,607
Thing that could be carbon neutral there people are going to want to return on their money

1459
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
I don't really

1460
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,447
Care about that even if they say they do

1461
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,567
Even if they say they do the end of the day they're going to want to return on

1462
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
So what happens how do you

1463
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:04,735
How do you protect this thing that you built and keep doing it

1464
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
I mean cuz at some point a big shoe company Nike or Adidas might say we want to buy you for 40 billion dollar

1465
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
End

1466
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
And then they happen

1467
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Well you know

1468
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,863
We don't believe that there needs to be the tension

1469
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,191
Between financial success and success for

1470
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Other

1471
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,567
Purpose Driven aspects of our business and namely the environment for us

1472
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,383
I think that's true for a lot of businesses that we have

1473
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,479
We have a lot of debates inside the company because there's always a balance like

1474
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
If something cost

1475
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,783
20 times as much

1476
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:42,111
Yet it's way more sustainable and maybe you can't do that

1477
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,903
Yeah I'll take that take that choice

1478
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,487
But on the margin you can absolutely do it once a little more expensive

1479
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,839
It's much better for and it falls out of Northstar of of making a lower carbon footprint

1480
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,863
Shure product

1481
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
Will do it

1482
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:57,215
I'm at Swedish don't we don't see that tension I think

1483
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,751
That the other aspect is

1484
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
We built this into the charter that come

1485
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:05,151
So our Charter says we have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders

1486
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,223
And we have a equal responsibility to the alarm

1487
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,551
And tell if camera are no longer in the business

1488
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
And some other

1489
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
Some other person takes over

1490
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,159
That they still have a responsibility to

1491
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,487
To do what are Charter says unless they get two-thirds of our shareholders

1492
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
2 hour

1493
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
Devote and say that

1494
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
That they don't care about the alarm

1495
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
Until

1496
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
We've kind of

1497
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Embedded this in the fabric of the

1498
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
The company

1499
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
It so people have to know when they sign on for a financing

1500
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
This is part of the deal

1501
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
I want to shift

1502
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
You mentioned

1503
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,199
Tell him that there was a time where you were dipping into your savings it was stressing you out back in

1504
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
2014

1505
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
RV both of you feel

1506
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,415
Like you can breathe a sigh of relief now that you're financially your on stable ground cuz your company is valued at

1507
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,231
Billion points 6 or do you still have stress about

1508
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Financial math

1509
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah it's it's never been about what we need to rest really need much money

1510
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,911
Can be happy and live so it's never really been about

1511
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
The big valuation of a company or anything

1512
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
I think we have enough

1513
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
Anxiety between US just

1514
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
Push forward

1515
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,687
That regardless of it while we're still in there we're still

1516
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,991
We're still cranking and push angle

1517
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,319
We we prepare ourselves more now than we used to paracelsus

1518
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
When we started the company

1519
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Or certainly efficiently

1520
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,207
In a better situation financially

1521
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Little less

1522
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Financial stress

1523
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,047
But but yeah this

1524
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Did the anxiety

1525
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
He still is Papa

1526
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,935
You're always sitting there thinking of between things

1527
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,007
You could be doing better and in anyone who started a business will know that

1528
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,359
That feeling I'm often times people asking a question must be able to work long hours

1529
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,919
And you like what it's not that's the wrong question

1530
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
It's it's like when you start something

1531
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,527
Just hanging beads 6in in your Brian and

1532
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,087
You don't shut it off and it's a voice that's there

1533
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
24/7 / time and

1534
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,695
You constantly thinking about it then

1535
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,255
How you know if I retire from Spore tonight

1536
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,351
That the head is pressurized moments of getting out in front of

1537
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:05,471
Lots of people at times in and playing sport but this isn't in some ways

1538
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,799
Write a memo sustained pressure on its it's a very very

1539
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Cool things to do in

1540
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,199
And I was certainly we've had some some good progress but we got a long long way to go to achieve what we want to

1541
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,551
How much do you think this has happened use because of Locker

1542
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Xavier Skilling Ann Arbor

1543
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
You know

1544
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
Along the way

1545
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Weather

1546
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,279
Bee mating Jolly roller

1547
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
The difference

1548
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
Characters along the way that

1549
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,167
The pop tops Hemingway the right time

1550
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
Calculate anything other than

1551
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
Then lock

1552
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:43,103
It was a dude a lot of different off ramps along with Jenny where if you were logical and rational

1553
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
You would have stopped

1554
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
For whatever reason

1555
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
We

1556
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
You know we keep going and

1557
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
When it's

1558
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
Just seemed like it was impossible

1559
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
We met at the

1560
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,159
Find a different solution in and keep on going a little button

1561
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
You need that

1562
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,023
If we had any luck

1563
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:06,399
If I had any luck personally I mean I think we've been given an enormous leg out without families

1564
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,239
And without my mom and dad and now without without wives and and

1565
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
Yeah that was a

1566
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
That was a loving household that

1567
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,895
Khaled education that encouraged us to go in tight wrists and do what we wanted to do and

1568
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:22,527
Not everyone has that and it's been enormously important part of the journey because I think we leaned on them

1569
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
I know I have

1570
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,575
Achievement

1571
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
It's very very Italy to keep on guy

1572
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,183
I think they're at their inextricably linked

1573
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
I've always thought of lockers

1574
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,047
Some random event happening to you

1575
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
But

1576
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
That happens then what you going to do with it

1577
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
And I think we've

1578
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,751
We've had the good fortune together to

1579
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Have great

1580
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
Timing

1581
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Across a whole host

1582
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Thanks

1583
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Start a business in

1584
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:53,759
Put up a website and seven months and reach 10000 people in in a week

1585
01:04:54,527 --> 01:05:00,159
But we also you know we received and capitalize on that opportunity and we worked super hard

1586
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
And made some good decisions along the way to

1587
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:09,119
Turn that lock into something that was really positive cuz I just I just think you can't can't really separate those those ideas

1588
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,935
That Contracting unfortunately we've we've done a

1589
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:18,335
How to get rid of both that's Joey

Are there ongoing effort to make allbirds a carbon-neutral shoe

1595
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
Instead of keeping the recipe of secret did actually open source it so that anyone wants to make soap

1596
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727

Pay thanks for sticking around because

1626
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,727
It's time now for how you built that and our story today comes to us from Kirby

1627
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Daily

1628
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,359
From White Salmon Washington and Kirby and his family spend a lot of time

1629
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:00,479
At the beach which means they have all observed one of the great wonders of marine life

1630
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,039
You care about it all the time you hear about the

1631
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,647
Beach umbrellas that fly through the air and land on somebody's car

1632
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,303
Those things blow down the beach like crazy

1633
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,887
Turn right the big gust of wind a metal stake and just

1634

Do I have to Brown

1635
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,263
Kirby just wasn't satisfied with the stuff that was on the market

1636
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
Lots of

1637
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,847
Inexpensive tent Stakes that you pound in with a

1638
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
The hammer or Rock

1639
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,527
There's no really good to list solution that would hold in all weather conditions and that would work in

1640
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:38,879
Can sand Woodwork in Play Because Kirby is a professional woodworker

1641
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
He started to Tinker around with ideas

1642
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,719
Ask for a better ground anchor

1643
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,023
He was inspired by one thing

1644
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,583
In particular you've probably seen it

1645
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
And it looks like a gigantic

1646
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
Wine cork opener

1647
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,495
And in case you haven't seen this giant wine cork opener

1648
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
Think

1649
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Pets

1650
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Because

1651
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,591
People use this Corkscrew thing is

1652
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,895
Is kind of an anchor to help keep their dogs

1653
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,919
Tethered outside

1654
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
And

1655
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
Because the screw threads have quite a bit more surface area

1656
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,087
It increases the surface area between the soil and the ground anchor

1657
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,903
A big screw like that

1658
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,463
Could be great for anchoring all kinds of things

1659
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,607
Shade or rain structures you know the big tarp over an outdoor kitchen when you're camping

1660
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,655
Artists at art festivals

1661
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,471
Their boots with all of their art

1662
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Experimenting

1663
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Prototypes

1664
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,823
Looking for a company to make the screw

1665
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,615
And while he's doing all this

1666
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
He has this huge

1667
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
Earth-shattering Epiphany the internet

1668
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Is amazing

1669
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,319
Kirby was able to locate the perfect recycled plastic

1670
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
Take the screws

1671
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,927
And then Kirby did a Kickstarter campaign about 3 years ago

1672
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,743
Erase $45,000 in bloom

1673
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
His product was launched

1674
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:54,655
The crazy thing that kept happening over and over again is when you get a phone call or an email that says

1675
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,703
I'm going camping on Friday

1676
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,007
I have to have these for the weekend

1677
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,567
And so I don't know how we went from this

1678
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
Product that never existed

1679
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,383
2 something

1680
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,479
People have to have for the weekend and they're upset if they're not going to be able to get it

1681
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,783
Okay great story so far right

1682
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
But then one morning

1683
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
Got a year ago

1684
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,623
Kirby gets

1685
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
Email you know an angry email

1686
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,999
And it said I ordered your screws

1687
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,303
From this promotion you did on Facebook

1688
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,607
And I haven't gotten anything yet

1689
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
And I thought

1690
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,727
I don't even know what this is we were not running a promotion on Facebook

1691
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
Probably know where this is headed

1692
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,591
Scammers were starting to get into Kirby's business

1693
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,735
They were copying his photos and design and advertising cheap knockoffs and way undercutting his prices

1694
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
So as soon as we would

1695
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:46,879
Report one of these for trademark violations is how we would take them down

1696
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
One would disappear and then

1697
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
2 morewood pop-up

1698
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,999
So Kirby actually did something

1699
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Unusual

1700
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,839
He sent his own product for free

1701
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
Anyone who would made the mistake

1702
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
Buying a cheap knockoff

1703
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,519
Meanwhile some of his loyal customers kept reporting The Knockout sites

1704
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,847
Deleting comments warning new customers about the scam

1705
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,871
We created this

1706
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
International

1707
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,431
Police force

1708
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,479
Probably a 50 or 60 people

1709
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,063
If it would email us everyday and say here's another one

1710
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
And

1711
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
The whole thing is

1712
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
Started dying down

1713
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,695
Scammers eventually went away

1714
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,535
Kirby has now spent about a year running his company full time

1715
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,375
With his wife and the same year as company launch 2015

1716
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,655
His daughter

1717
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,239
For a long time my wife and I refer to Dennis

1718
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,799
Twins and they both had their

1719
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
Frustrations in work

1720
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,127
Really proud how both of them are growing up

1721
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,687
That's Kirby or daily

1722
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,247
Is product is called orange screw it

1723
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Colored Bridal

1724
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,111
Made just under $1000000

1725
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:57,023
