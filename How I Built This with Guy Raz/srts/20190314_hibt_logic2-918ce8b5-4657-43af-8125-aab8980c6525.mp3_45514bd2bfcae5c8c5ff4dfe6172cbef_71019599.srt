You everything you were telling me you got to have a girl record you got to head Hard Rock Breakfast Club you got this

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
I like telling me what to do and I sat down with a young man who had just as much experience as I do

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
I did and was prepared to risk everything to attain his dream and he

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
He needed me needed me as much as I needed him and I was like

You could not get away

44
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
From this song

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
I feel like I'm out of my mind

46
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,448
I don't know if you don't know this track

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800

It was nominated for a Grammy and it

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Actually turned logic

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
You can imagine

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000

Two subjects that

00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Aren't always friends

And Center in the world of Hip Hop

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Nothing about this song is

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
When logic performs at live

66
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
People in the audience

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Break down and cry

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
So many people connect with it and a

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
And personal way

70
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Almost like

71
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
He's rapping about their eggs

72
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
Who is actually born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II

74
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Second

75
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
Was writing something that

76
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Authentically describes his own

77
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
About growing up around violence

78
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Benediction

79
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Without a stable home life

80
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Life and sometimes

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Without anywhere to live

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
And the chances that

83
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
One day be performing in front of

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Tens of thousands of

85
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
People with so

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Totally remote

87
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Could do was

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Write music

89
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
And rap

90
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
For the most part

91
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
That's what he was doing 10 years ago

92
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
In and around the DC metro area

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Around the same time

94
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
Chris cerulli

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Psychology

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Struggling to find work

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
In the music

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
In fact

99
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
He couldn't even get an internship

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Any of the big record labels when he

101
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
First came across logic

102
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Will get there

103
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Because the story of how logic

104
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,360
Grand logic is as much about his talent as a musician

105
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
Is it is about Chris Ruth Talent as a marketer

106
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
And today's episode is about what happens

107
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,344
Totally different people with totally different skill sets

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Happened to me

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
And you'll hear from Chris cerulli a little bit later forced to logic who as I mentioned

110
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
Osborne Sir Robert Bryson Hall II

111
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
My dad likes to tell me now that we have a better relationship that he's the one who gave me that but I know it was my mommy

112
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Because

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,431
She's like of English descent if you go far back enough and she's an eccentric woman

114
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
And she decided to name me

115
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
Serta first and my father's name is Robert Bryson Hall

116
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
And so she made me Sir Robert Bryson Hall II

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Where in Technic

118
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Because she added the sir I'm actually the

119
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
The first which is really funny

120
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Whenever I have a boil named him the third but he'll be the second

121
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
So I'm

122
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
Your parents and I guess you were the only child of their

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Marriage of their time together Willie Marriott

124
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
They were never married I was born out of wedlock

125
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
My mom like the nitty-gritty of it is

126
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
She's just a

127
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Deep deep deep deep down

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Good woman

129
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
You're not a young age was

130
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Molested

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
We've been raped growing up she got into the all kind of drugs

132
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Running around with drug dealers in

133
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
My father

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,631
Was never really in the picture because he was addicted to crack cocaine

135
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
So when you were little

136
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
It was just

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
It was

138
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
You

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Never knew that you just need your mom

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Yahoo I knew my dad you know but I knew him as a

141
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Drug addict

142
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Hey witches

143
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Messed up

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Reno

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
But he would yeah it was like he'd go away for a few years and I need to come back

146
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
He leave and he come back

147
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
I can but they were never together

148
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Whether that's the one thing is like they

149
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
It's really weird I've seen my mom go back to a lot of man she never win

150
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
I never had that moment

151
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Liftware felux

152
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
So you're

153
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Your mom and dad basically

154
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
They had a

155
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Brief relationship you were

156
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
You're the price of that relationship your dad

157
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Is African-American and your mom is Caucasian she's white

158
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
And tell me about

159
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Like where you corrupted you

160
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Did you grow up in a in a house or an apartment

161
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,623
Yeah we grew up in Section 8 housing so food stamps welfare

162
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Had a few hundred dollars a month from the government to live off

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Jr Vaughn

164
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Yeah just me and my mom she's been a lot of that

165
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
In different times on you no alcohol

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Cigarettes and I

167
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Liam remember X where

168
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
We have

169
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
Three and a half dollars that could have bought us some rice and some

170
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
Some powdered eggs in NYC by a pack of cigarette

171
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
I grew up with her

172
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Saying the craziest things like

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
I was just a kid you know I was a hyper kid and then

174
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
If I pissed her off she'd say things like you deserve to feel pain or she called me

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,159
Are any of these crazy things because of the systemic racism that was deep down inside her with

176
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
Which is insane but mind you it's like she was troubled so I feel bad for her it's not like I'm like all my mom's screw her

177
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Terrible woman it's just like

178
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
Wish you a good mom know which human being who had a terrible past and took that out on me and her other kids yes

179
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
And that's the reason she's not my life

180
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
So you grew up with your mom

181
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,991
Mainly and we would see your dad from time to time and was he

182
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
We serve go in and out of

183
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
That smells or was he

184
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Constantly

185
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Using drugs

186
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Yeah he was

187
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
You've pretty much constantly using drugs

188
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
A lot of my childhood

189
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Was in AA meeting

190
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Like you know you know

191
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Just kind of reciting the prayer at the end of it and

192
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,055
Listening to all these people talk about all the things they go through which is so hard and it's so

193
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Difficult

194
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Insane people

195
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Just kind of

196
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,015
Using again and then getting clean in this and that my dad was like that one of my earliest childhood memories

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
About 5

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,439
And my dad I don't know why I was with him but I was with him for I think the weekend and my dad

199
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Take me to Southeast

200
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
DC

201
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
And left me in a car

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,887
Back of the car for 5 hours while him and some woman I didn't know

203
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
I went to go

204
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Smoke crack

205
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
In this in this house which was insane crazy

206
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,479
How how did you avoid like getting into drugs and and alcohol

207
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
It just really really really scared me you know I ran around and I've done a lot of stuff I shotguns at Rob people

208
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
I've done a bunch of stupid things because I was around other stupid people because I felt that they were

209
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Where my family you know it's why a lot of young men and women join actual real

210
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Gangs it's because they have nothing at home and here's a family who will protect them and it's kind of sick and twisted

211
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,455
Did because it's like okay we're going to hurt other people but these people won't hurt me so we'll hurt others together

212
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,807
And then at least that way I'm safe but there was that voice deep down that was like

213
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,927
Yo like this isn't right and for me when I got in the music for real

214
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
And I was

215
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
18 and I was like I'm not going to let anything hold of my father is an incredible musician singer percussion is

216
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Explain cocoa and Chocolate City

217
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
DC I mean amazing and I saw

218
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
What cocaine did to him and

219
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
And I was like

220
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Can't let this happen

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Enemy so that's why I steer

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
So sticky

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
With music for

224
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Forsaken being exposed to it

225
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
I guess it is a teenager you

226
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
You started meet some people who

227
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Can I take an interest in you

228
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Musically who were they

229
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
What kind of even when it comes to music I had a friend named Josh

230
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
And he was

231
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Who would eventually going to be like my Godmother's

232
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Sun

233
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
And I her name was Mary Jo and I love her and she

234
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
She's sweetest woman in the world

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
Any kind of saw that I had an itch for

236
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
Raps I just freestyle

237
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,895
You know on the block with all the all my friends and had fun and so he was he was a person that

238
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
I was there in

239
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
A gentleman named Solomon Taylor who was my mentor

240
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Who Solomon

241
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
To Solomon was this guy that I met when I was volunteering in our fellowship

242
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
The right fit Rockville Football League

243
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,999
Just to get extra credit to be able to pass 8th grade and so I was 13 he was 19 at the time

244
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
He's a hustler

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,631
So basically you have it all these football I would set up the football field and you have like kiwi in

246
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
You know these kids in middle school and stop playing football and what he would do

250
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
And then duplicate to tape create highlights and then sell those

251
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Did the parents

252
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
Which is really amazing and then so we became friends and then I eventually kind of work for him at his booth and he paid me nothing and it taught me a lot

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,463
A lot about a lot in the winter in the freezing cold in the snow standing at a booth outside

254
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
And this dude was there for me he keep the introduced me to you know so many

255
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679

Cuter and like what we're doing that

317
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
I was on a Yahoo messaging

318
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Chat about Music & Hip Hop in

319
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Some some person introduced me to

320
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,375
A program for recording a lot of people use it in radio called Adobe Audition

321
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,007
Sure and I was at the house I don't know what that is

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
This small file

323
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
Took probably about 9 hours the person actually

324
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
We sat with me for 9 hours on my computer

325
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
So they were somewhere in Alaska I don't remember

326
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,343
And they transfer the file onto my computer is an illegal download

327
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
And so I learned kind of had to use that and by the time I was 18 years old and living

328
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
It would Mary Jo and had two jobs Solomon had provided me with a PC very strong PC at the time

337
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Closet with a

338
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Pillows around it

339
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
And just would just

340
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
I would just go and go and go

341
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Every song ever

363
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Is actually a song on there

364
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Call youngster.

365
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
What you been inspired

366
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,607
The series so then my following me stay with him tonight read than young Sinatra want you

367
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
And that's when I said I'm working at a supermarket

368
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Quit

369
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
And I was like

370
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
This

371
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Is it

372
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,407
She's everything I'm just going to do it now is the time I'm young it's okay to fail

373
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
It's okay to fall down cuz I don't want to look back in my 50s like

374
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
With Rick

375
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,111
Can you imagine being yappy 60 70 years old filled with

376
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Rat

377
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
There was that

378
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Voice in my head

379
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Like nah man you can do this

380
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
That's when I went to go live with with Lenny and his bae

381
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
And I College Park

382
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,935
So you live in a basement with a friend in college Park's run 2010 2009-2010 trying to understand me

383
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
You decide I'm going to make I'm going to make a go at this

384
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
Like you're putting out mixtapes

385
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
And I guess your

386
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Performing locally you like going to open mics

387
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
But you have no money you are still bouncing you're so pretty broke and I was so broke that I was

388
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Steal quarters from Lenny's little life

389
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
Like collection that he had so I could go buy food and he actually like

390
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
Screamed at me was like

391
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Just ask

392
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Van Dyke

393
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
It's all good I get you

394
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
I didn't have a job I was supposed to get a job

395
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
It was unspoken and

396
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
And I kind of just sat down with him and was like

397
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Can you just

398
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Give me year

399
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
Like can you just give me one yeah I know this is

400
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Insane but it seems like every week

401
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
Something new and exciting is happening and now is the moment

402
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Could you just give me just

403
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
1 year

404
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
And this was 2011 so I was 20

405
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
I was just turn 21

406
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
And any and yet he gave it for a year

407
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
I

408
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,767
Did everything I could and you just put out music on the internet you weren't selling

409
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Yeah I know it was all free

410
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
All right we're going to come back to logic

411
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Just couple minutes

412
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Because

413
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Wow

414
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,311
At this point his life he was crashing and his friends basement

415
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Is future manager

416
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Chris Ruth

417
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Is going to college in New York

418
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
This point they do not know each other in fact

419
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
A career in music isn't even on Chris's radar

420
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Because at that point in his life

421
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
He was a laser focus

422
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
I'm soccer

423
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
I

424
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Thought I was going to be a professional athlete

425
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
I played soccer

426
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Very competitively

427
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Growing up all the way through

428
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
Peru High School in

429
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
.

430
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
An opportunity played

431
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Vision one which

432
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Which I thought was the first step

433
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Up to

434
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
You know completing that go all right

435
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Will you playing by the way

436
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
II my freshman year I played for

437
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Canisius College in Buffalo

438
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,063
And you know I thought that was the best opportunity for me at the time

439
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
They're very competitive team

440
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
Soon after that I think after my sophomore year

441
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
I transferred in

442
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
In between men

443
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Explain a different School

444
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
I realize that I do

445
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
You know I wasn't good enough I was I was very good but I was in

446
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
I wasn't good enough

447
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
Play at the Harlem trying to figure out how you

448
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Like me to transition into music

449
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Did you stink

450
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
I'm not going to do Sports I'm going to get into the music business

451
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Yeah

452
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
I was 20 or 19 probably at the time when I

453
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Started trying to figure it out

454
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,463
I knew when I stopped playing I wanted to do something I love them as passion about I think that's all I knew

455
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
So I ask myself

456
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
What else

457
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Do I love as much as

458
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
That's sport in the only thing that I can answer with

459
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Was music

460
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
That's what I'm going to do

461
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,567
I didn't know where I start I didn't know anybody that didn't have any relationships

462
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Barnes & Noble in

463
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Kind of read books

464
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
On on the music business

465
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm trying to figure it out

466
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
And I chose management

467
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Because I thought it would be

468
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
The least power to end

469
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
And I was like okay if I find Talent

470
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
And start working with them that would be my way

471
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Into the

472
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
But you didn't think like when it goes like

473
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
See if I get a job working for like what

474
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Please big

475
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Record labels or management

476
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Companies in

477
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
Experience like that wasn't where what you thought you should do it first

478
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
I tried

479
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Oh I definitely tried that route

480
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
Started with internship

481
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
I didn't graduate college

482
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Yes I didn't

483
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
Really apply for jobs but

484
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
I don't want every major

485
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
Record label I apply for inter

486
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Internships in

487
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
You know I kept getting turned down

488
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,159
When I actually got one interview that they actually had me come in for an interview

489
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
And I thought it went great and ultimately

490
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Did you know they said

491
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
You know sorry this

492
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Is it going to work

493
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
And I just remember I emailed a woman denied a site

494
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
Do you still have the email I asked

495
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Why

496
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
Isn't isn't this going to work

497
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
And then she told me I didn't have enough

498
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Experience

499
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Which I just thought

500
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,663
Was really funny cuz I went out for an internship in the funny part about in the reason why I said

501
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Not I have a team actually printed out reason

502
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
I'm getting it

503
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Frame for the office

504
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
It was deaf

505
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Which is ultimately where we're at

506
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Logix logic signed to

507
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
Probably a year a little bit over a year

508
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
I see you're living

509
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
I'm an island

510
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Parents

511
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
And

512
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,167
Getting all these rejections for internship so so what like you decide

513
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Maybe I'll just

514
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
Do this without an internship like maybe I'll do

515
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Just figure this out

516
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
Yeah and then to be honest I didn't have another choice

517
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
I didn't I couldn't get into

518
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Friendship I didn't have any relationships or

519
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
You know friends or family that work in the business.

520
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
To give me an opportunity so

521
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
Yeah I didn't I didn't have a choice that was that was the only

522
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Pat that I had

523
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
So what did you just did you decide to like start

524
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
A business or did you

525
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
First decide

526
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
I mean, scour the internet

527
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
I can find someone

528
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
You think that

529
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,216
Starting a business came a little bit later I was just like you know what let me

530
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,288
Let me find some Talent Let me let me reach out to them and

531
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,872
Just kind of start a dialogue and try to build a relationship with some of them

532
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
You know convince them to let me manage

533
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
How did you come across

534
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Patrick Star

535
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Yeah it was it was it was

536
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
It was kind of by by chance

537
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
You know

538
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Yeah I use the word

539
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Serendipity

540
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
I was

541
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Managing

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
An artist a rapper

543
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
Add a Philly at the time

544
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
And this was

545
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
2011 so is very early days of

546
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704

And I was sitting

551
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
From my computer

552
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616

554
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Tweeted out a a YouTube

555
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
Right there was no description in there was no

556
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
Anything else in in the tweeters

557
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Is the Winking eye and I clicked it

558
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
It was a

559
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Acapella video of logic rapping

560
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
Todd University of Maryland

561
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Campus and it was

562
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
Super super low-budget in poorly done

563
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
There was there was wind in the microphone he actually is

564
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Add the microphone like tucked in his hoodie

565
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
There was just something about it that

566
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
That stood out to me and I thought it was really special

567
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
And I kind of dog in a little deeper to try and find out

568
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Who he was and

569
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
And reach out to

570
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320

On the phone

574
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
I probably asked if he had managed

575
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Cuz I don't want to step on anybody's toes

576
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072

577
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
You know I'm a kid

578
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,912

00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
No experience no resume

581
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080

582
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
To some of or one of the other artists I was working

583
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920

00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
You know a lot of

603
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
What I was doing was

604
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Was learning as I went

605
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
Looking back now I am very grateful

606
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
Glad that I did learn that way cuz I

607
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
The best way to learn a lot of

608
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Management a lot of

609
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
The music

Business

611
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
This is very difficult

612
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't think

613
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Q10

614
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Learning

615
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616

620
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,136
You got a big building in Hollywood

621
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Visionary music group

622
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Yeah it was I remember I made

623
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
I got the time

624
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
You having to come up with a company name it was more just

625
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Ducati

626
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
You know I formed an LLC

627
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
See when I started to make money cuz I had

628
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Paid in full

629
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,008
I had a little I remember in Microsoft Word

630
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Document with

631
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
Some names and I ended up landing on

632
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
On the word Visionary I thought it was

633
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
At the time fitting

634
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
I think that's how logic and I

635
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
You know looked at ourselves I think we are doing something

636
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Very different

637
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
That I thought

638
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
And then we thought we

639
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Was vision

640
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Alright Chris

641
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,376
We've been leaving logic and lurcher cuz you are sitting right next to each other

642
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Logic what are you

643
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,288
What do you remember about Chris like you were his 21 guys named Chris

644
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
I'm going to meet you

645
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
What was your first impression of

646
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
Actually we met in New York City it was my

647
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,088
First time ever in New York and it was just kind of happened by chance that I was going to go there to shoot a music video

648
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
And I wanted to do something that was different and it's like a low-budget right live video game even like yeah there's low budget

649
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Anime

650
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,120
And that's what we had

651
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
The camera

652
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
And your point and shoot as we call it

653
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,288
And so yeah I go to Newark and

654
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,872
Chris had like a friend who had a rooftop and we're like rooftop

655
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
You know that's

656
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,480
That's content right there

657
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
Can we go there

658
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
That the music videos called Mind of logic

659
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
And

660
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
Like skeleton me rapping it like a hundred twenty pounds

661
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
After

662
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,936
The shoot through the camera to buy you lunch and I'm not

663
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,056
Reboot less I'm ready I'm like

664
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
And so

665
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
We're coming near Times Square

666
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
Everybody tried group for a man like this is great let's go somewhere and he said okay

667
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
Ruby Tuesday or something like that I might let's go now about to get a free chicken

668
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Sandwich or something

669
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
How do you know

670
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,304
Yeah I'm used Taurus stuff you need any you want to go somewhere else and like what I didn't realize is

671
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,960
Looking back I'm talking to you a broke college student with maybe $150 in his account like if that

672
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Just got to last in the next 6 years of his life

673
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
And we talked and he was like I want to manage you

674
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
And it was honest with me was I hey look like I'm just getting into this to he's like but I made some connections I know some people and you and you

675
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
You know you met some people at blogs

676
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
Different blogs on online and ndk music

677
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
Spaces were

678
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Young people were excited

679
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
And word-of-mouth

680
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Via the Internet was a big deal

681
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
And I was like

682
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
All right well I was unable to sign in

683
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
That was a big

684
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
We're going to do this

685
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
And he wasn't

686
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Pushing to sign anything either

687
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
And that's a really

688
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Amazing thing

689
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Because he

690
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Key

691
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Allowed

692
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
He was like yeah I'm going to walk the walk

693
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Like I'm going to show you

694
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
That I'm going to do this

695
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
And that's what we did for about the first 6 months

696
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,832
Engineer design you would like to try this out committing to you

697
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah I remember

698
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
We released the music video and like overnight

699
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
It had 20000 views

700
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
But you gotta understand

701
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
20000 views in 2011

702
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
I was going from a hundred

703
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
Views and it was all people I knew I liked that

704
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,056
To the point where we actually sat

705
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Chris down all of us

706
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
And

707
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
Intervention and I was like

708
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,064
Yo what's up man you pay him for views or what cuz there's like back then we're like people it was a big deal because

709
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Fake it till you make it people would pay

710
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,208
Airbnb FAQ is a not really like I can prove it to you I can show you and

711
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,048
And Maddie it was legit but even before you get that point like

712
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out like

713
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,960
You're like eating at Ruby Tuesday or whatever and Chris is like hey give me a give me a give me a chance

714
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
And

715
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,824
You don't have anyone managing you at that point and I guess you're

716
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Still not

717
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Kind of an unknown

718
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Artist

719
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
But what made you

720
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
You think yeah

721
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
I trust this guy with stroller experience

722
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Who's like my Asics

723
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Cuz obviously

724
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
We know how the story is going to end

725
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,488
In 2011 you did not

726
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,584
And neither of you knew how this is going to end you both could have just like

727
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Fizzled out but

728
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
What was it about him that you thought

729
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Yeah I'm going to try this

730
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
I met a lot of Shady

731
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
People who wanted man

732
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
You know

733
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,712
Older dudes who were once kind of in the industry you know different people who were musicians themselves

734
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,832
I didn't feel like I was a priority it was a bunch of guys who knew everything they were telling me

735
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Got to have a girl record

736
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
You got to head hard regular

737
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Breakfast Club

738
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
You got this out of that and I like telling me what

739
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
And I sat down

740
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
With a young man

741
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Who had just as much experience as I did

742
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
And I was looking in a mirror

743
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
I was looking at

744
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
A green kid

745
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
When no idea what he was doing

746
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
It was prepared

747
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
The risk

748
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Everything

749
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
To attain his dream

750
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
And he needed me

751
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Needed me

752
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
As much as I needed him

753
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
And I was like

754
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Cat look like

755
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Yellow

756
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
That's what it was

757
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Tok Chris

758
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Pelagic anchors

759
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Forgive me for kind of characterizing this way but

760
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
A sentence like

761
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Like logic you were

762
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
You were the brand

763
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
What the business is

764
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Was being built around

765
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,824
You and your brand and your talent and you

766
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
It's like you're the product that

767
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
You putting out to the world

768
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
But Chris

769
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,296
Like when I do interviews with other entrepreneurs it's at this point when they go out to VC's and raise money

770
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
2

771
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
The product end of the world

772
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
How are you funding this how are you

773
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
How are you having lunch

774
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Record music and cos

775
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
I think at this time

776
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
You were just releasing all of his music

777
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
I'm putting it on the internet and letting anybody

778
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Take it right

779
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Yeah and in

780
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
What we were doing like you said we were building the brand

781
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
I viewed that

782
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Putting out free music as as in

783
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Vesting

784
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
In the brand right as we were

785
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
Building an audience in a fanbase

786
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,016
That was becoming more and more invested

787
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,064
And what that means is

788
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
They would

789
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,904
Later down the road whenever we asked

790
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
For it

791
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
Spend the money meaning

792
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
How we're going to put out our first

793
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
Gto project for sale

794
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
Oar hey we're going to put up a tour for the first time

795
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
We spent $12

796
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
To come see me in San Diego

797
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
Hey we're selling T-shirts for $20

798
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
So I

799
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
That's how I view

800
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,592
We were essentially monetizing free music

801
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
So how did you guys make a living

802
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Different White

803
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
2011-2012

804
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
You were putting out and maybe between

805
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
13 like you were just

806
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Putting out free music

807
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
How are you like

808
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
How are you guys paying your rent how she's buying food

809
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
My parents were

810
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Very very

811
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
Very good about allow me to deliver Target out of still in school

812
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
I didn't have to I didn't have to worry about that

813
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
Logic was still at

814
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,752
Lenny's apartment so you know we

815
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
Didn't have too many expenses at the time in

816
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
Advise you not to interrupt but like

817
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
I was in college park sleep Inn Atlanta

818
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Couch

819
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
And you know we were we were still shopping ourselves like we wanted a deal that was like the goal and you know there was even in

820
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Independent companies

821
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
That put

822
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,976
Contract for 1.5 million dollars in our hands front of you

823
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
When front of us and Chris had and I remember you said something really cool

824
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
And then I was like I don't know either

825
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
Well tell me things worth 1.5 million and 1.5 million.

826
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Lot of money right now

827
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Young kid

828
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Inso

829
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Long story short

830
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
Yeah we turn it down like it was nothing

831
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Why

832
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Because

833
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
They wanted me first of all we were getting screwed over on points on royalties on longevity they also wanted us they were going to

834
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
Take a lot of control

835
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
And we were like now we always have to be in

836
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Because we know

837
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
What we want

838
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,776
I just want to kind of pause for a second just ask about music

839
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
For Mama because

840
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,944
What will what do you think it is and it was

841
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
About your music that

842
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Cats with people like

843
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
It's rabbits Hip Hop

844
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
But generally like

845
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
You know you're described as having positive messages

846
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Is and

847
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
And you know

848
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,304
Talking about things in an open way about your own emotions

849
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
And about

850
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
Injustice in about anxiety and

851
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
Depression all these things

852
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
Do you think that's what was connecting with

853
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
With people even from the beginning

854
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,592
Yeah I think I was the Everyman

855
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
Or every kid or every person or every whatever it was like

856
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
People were watching me grow up

857
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
Like a child star

858
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
United me like they were

859
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
They listen to this and they hear me say

860
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
I can't wait to make it I can't wait to have

861
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Fans

862
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,000
I can't wait to be the man with the master plan I can't wait like

863
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Daddy. And then

864
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Like me to like I can't wait to

865
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
Graduate college I can't wait to

866
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
You know raise my children I can't wait to

867
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,032
Follow my dreams I'm going to do that and I'm like follow your dreams like no matter what

868
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Haters Gonna Hate

869
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,576
Even today like on a mainstream level like

870
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
I called us so much

871
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,440
Things I talk about openly from anxiety depression

872
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
All the

873
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,792
Who said Injustice the things going on

874
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
One I'm scared to talk about

875
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Car was scared

876
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
At a point cuz I was scared that

877
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
How people would perceive me or this it at

878
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
But to it's like

879
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Now it's become a

880
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Trend

881
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,104
You know you got you got you got rappers hardcore rappers and

882
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
People talking about

883
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Depression

884
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
And mental health

885
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
And I ain't the first

886
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
I think it's just

887
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Time

888
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Place

889
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Yellow a bit image

890
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Just

891
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
I'm doing this nerdy

892
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Young kid that

893
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
Other people felt they could relate to

894
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:43,072
So how soon after Chrissy start working with logic did you say all right let's we got to go on tour

895
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
And did you go on tour

896
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,960
Yeah I'm not sure exactly how soon but it was it was an intuition

897
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Nothing right because there was no

898
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
There's no metrics at the time or data that we

899
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
We had that said how you can sell out

900
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
30 shows across the country it was something that we both felt

901
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Hey I think it is

902
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Feels right and

903
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
I think we could probably go go on a tour now and

904
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
How we did that

905
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Because that's an expense

906
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
Sipping right there's a lot of startup capital

907
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
That you need to fund a tour

908
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,280
We ultimately sign

909
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
A record deal

910
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
The phone doctor

911
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Could we needed the money

912
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
I think we could have waited longer if

913
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
We had some money but

914
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
You know if we didn't have

915
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Opportunity

916
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,128
NFL right I mean this is 2012 the record deal you signed is

922
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,096
If there is a time like Now's the Time and

923
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
Yeah but I'll tell you this it was very difficult

924
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
You know looking at a check

925
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,032
And seeing you know lower six figures very lower

926
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Just six figures

927
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
In advance which is still great

928
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
And then literally going okay well

929
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:07,040
Yo after XYZ takes a percentage is on my team management lawyer at that time

930
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
I have to put all of this

931
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,416
And do a tour and the end that was that was a hard thing

932
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,792
But it was I just had that young man was like the way I just got the check and I got to let it all go but it was worth it right

933
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
This is your Sweat Equity in in in the brain

934

Put all that soap

936
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
You could have

937
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,520
Gone to the tour and been broken and we might have to be

938
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
I can today

939
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
When I was a pasta with a very real possibility

940
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
The odds were

941
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
In that favor

942
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
That it wasn't going to happen

943
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
When we come back in

944
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,624
At the moment lol chicken Chris hit the road but there will be speedbumps ahead

945

Hey welcome back to how I built this from

988
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
NPR

989
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
So it's 2012

990
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,576
Logic and his manager Chris Subaru have signed a record deal

991
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Def Jam

992
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Hardly glamorous

993
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,256
They still haven't cut an album and the money they got from signing that deal

994
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
They had to put most of it towards their first tour we toured the country and in a minute

995
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
Nissan Altima right eye I rented from Enterprise Rent-A-Car and I remember filling out the paper

996
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
Working it specifically said that the cars the vehicles could not leave New York State and we were literally touring the country

997
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
And the way it was routed we are going to California and back. You know they'll never know we left

998
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
And then I ended up getting you know million and one tickets for fruit going through tolls and

999
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
All over the country but

1000
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
No it was not first class into 5-star accommodations worth

1001
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
Logging garbage bags and we were you know selling merge aftershows I'd run in cell

1002
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,992
Emerge after shows logical come over to merge booth and meats

1003
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
Before we try to figure it out and I had my right

1004
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
Mantidae my

1005
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
He was 18 years old

1006
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
Only employee

1007
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,728
At the time

1008
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
And I said to him I said Hey cuz I realized very quickly that I couldn't

1009
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
Be on the road full time and trying

1010
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
Sustained and run the business was very difficult

1011
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
I think I did the first

1012
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Two weeks of it

1013
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
And I remember saying I was

1014
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Hey dude you know

1015
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Would you like to tour manage

1016
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
And he was

1017
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
Sure and I threw them on the road

1018
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
Again

1019
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
We had no idea we're doing IUI

1020
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
RR accounting my accounting

1021
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
System

1022
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
Was manila envelope

1023
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
So

1024
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
Before tour I kind of wrote out every show so yeah

1025
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Denver Colorado

1026
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
And we'd settle all the shows in cash

1027
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
At the time that tour was actually

1028
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
No guarantee

1029
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
T torso

1030
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
The rest

1031
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
Chris Massey

1032
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
Tell him real very quick

1033
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Cuz it's something I want to say

1034
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Tell him about what happened

1035
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Trust

1036
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Again it was meant

1037
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
Manila envelope not settle in

1038
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
Tina put the cash in envelope and seal it

1039
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
We ended up finishing the tour

1040
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
So I have these

1041
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
He was 30 shows at 30 different envelopes

1042
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Looking back we just did so

1043
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
I kept the back

1044
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Back on the tour

1045
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
All of the envelope with all the cash

1046
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
And we carry it around and we were just

1047
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
Leave it in a green room and walk away

1048
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,808
Took that back back that was the entire income from the from the whole Court

1049
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
Serena getting back and I died later put everything into

1050
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,000
You don't Excel spreadsheet and in trying you know log everything so

1051
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:10,400
I would take out the cash and I would you know count it and put it on top of the manila envelope I was at my house the time Harrison

1052
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:16,800
I was helping me I had I was working still and Harrison's like you I got it don't worry about it I'll finish

1053
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
I said cool

1054
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
I ran off to work and I came back

1055
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
By the way

1056
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
I worked at a cold rule it was it was

1057
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
Like an Abercrombie & Fitch

1058
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
You know

1059
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Retail store

1060
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:34,720
An actor going on tour with logic managing logic tour you were back at the mall working retail

1061
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,328
Yeah and I came and I came back

1062
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
And

1063
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
Envelopes

1064
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Gone

1065
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
There was just 30 piles of cash

1066
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
That I had no idea

1067
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,384
What belong to what and I called Harrison and and

1068
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Nikki ended up

1069
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Trying to clean up

1070
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
So he took the envelope and rip them up and threw them out

1071
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
So I had no I had not your Christmas so we had all this cash we didn't know where it was really know how to divvy it

1072
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
But I say all this to say

1073
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,047
That Harrison went from fumbling 20 grand or whatever we had

1074
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,679
The juggling multiple multiple millions and millions of dollars in this company with Chris

1075
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,031
And it just goes to show that some nineteen-year-old 18 19 year old kid

1076
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,615
Is now this young 30 under 30

1077
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,431
Boss and I just I just had to show some love

1078
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
So you basically are your your accounting system is driving it on the back of a manila envelope and then later on

1079
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Insert into

1080
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,487
Excel but you walk away from that tour in the bike you but you made some cash

1081
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Everlywell

1082
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
How do you emphasize a super awkward question for both of you

1083
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
But I always asks if a Partnerships because it is

1084
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Part of business like

1085
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
How do you figure out

1086
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
Who gets paid what I mean obviously logic

1087
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,663
You're you're out there you're the face of this

1088
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,503
Organization like you represent all of the people now

1089
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
To work

1090
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,855
For Visionary music group and and the other people involved in so

1091
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
Chrisley how did you know

1092
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
How to

1093
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Divide that up

1094
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Dares

1095
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,815
Write a typical commission is how

1096
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
Work right

1097
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
15 to 20% is

1098
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Is the traditional Commission

1099
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
Fort for manager

1100
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
I've learned

1101
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,407
To love the commission model the more that I've grown

1102
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
It's because you

1103
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
You don't eat

1104
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
Unless everybody

1105
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
There's not one person

1106
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,879
You're at the table that has a full plate when you're starving it's it's

1107
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
That's why I've learnt to to love

1108
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
And things are crazy now

1109
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,071
You know that mean 30-plus million-dollar deals here and they're doing this doing that

1110
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
But you just got out

1111
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
You got to look in the mirror and say like what does this person deserve it

1112
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
Truly like yes or no take your ego out of it take

1113
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,055
Take one in at 1 an extra meal here there in a deal that

1114
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
If they had a lower percentage of

1115
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
But the truth is man like

1116
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,455
He earned every penny because he provides

1117
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
That

1118
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
With me

1119
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,599
I don't feel cheated I never felt that things were unfair or this or that and we

1120
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
Always so open we have conversations by we have talked about it

1121
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
And also to be fair

1122
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
When you get to my level there are

1123
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,071
There's there's a bunch of different people in your pocket

1124
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
But they're all there to make you money

1125
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,679
But I am always the majority

1126
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
And I think that that is

1127
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,287
Fair and where you find yourself with artists who are being like

1128
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Taken 4

1129
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127
70%

1130
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
I mean that is

1131
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
As insane as a collective

1132
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,015
And and that's where the music industry is really horrible violin

1133
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Chew you up and spit you out but

1134
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
This is my friend and my brother and

1135
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
But I think that's

1136
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
The

1137
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Secret

1138
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
Element that has

1139
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Enabled us to be

1140
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Successful for so long is

1141
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
It just did

1142
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Really simple

1143
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Genuinely

1144
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Caring

1145
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
About that person's well-being

1146
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
And what I mean by that

1147
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
You know going back to

1148
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
2012

1149
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,311
When we had a 1.5 million dollar offer

1150
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
I knew

1151
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
In my God

1152
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
It wasn't the right

1153
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,687
Opportunity they were not the right partner

1154
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
It was not a good deal

1155
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
But if I had

1156
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Just

1157
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
A suggested or advised him that

1158
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
We take this deal because I didn't really care

1159
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
What happened to him I wanted to get my commission

1160
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
And get my check in

1161
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
You know I'm out

1162
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
But I didn't

1163
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
So this is 2012

1164
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:30,495
It's still going to be like another two years before you guys release your first studio record

1165
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
But between that point

1166
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,919
And and the releases to be record you still are releasing mixtape were you guys selling

1167
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Again still kind of building the brand

1168
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,015
Releasing the music for free

1169
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,063
We are still putting out for free

1170
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
That tour was

1171
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
A massive eye-opener for us it was

1172
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
What logic and I had

1173
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:54,303
Thought we were building it approved to us and I think everybody else that it was

1174
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
It was something very real

1175
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
Bringing out

1176
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Three four hundred kids

1177
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
Cities across the country from putting out

1178
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
Free albums in free mixtapes

1179
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Been selling a lot of merch

1180
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,919
It was very became very real at that time and we wanted

1181
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
To keep that going

1182
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,759
Because if we were building leveraging is

1183
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
In building his brand soap

1184
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
Our thing was we wanted to make a splash what it was

1185
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Is time for debut album

1186
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,207
We wanted to have a really big first

1187
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Week sales

1188
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Obsolete we decided to can

1189
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Continue

1190
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
Building a putting out free product

1191
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:33,215
I figured as happy as you get the word out like we've done we've done interviews with like the

1192
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
The founder of glossier

1193
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
David the Cosmetics Brandon

1194
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,895
She started with a beauty blog in overtime she just finished built a following and then she introduced

1195
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
The brand of

1196
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
The products the product line and then

1197
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
We've we've done episode 1

1198
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Like founders of Instagram and how that way

1199
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
What kind of a

1200
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,415
A slow build like how did you how did people discover logic

1201
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
You can't put out the internet

1202
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
I hope people will find it

1203
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
Dog was it was it was

1204
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Much more thoughtful and there is

1205
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
The strategy behind everything I think

1206
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,191
What I did a lot as I watch

1207
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Wright III

1208
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
Would watch the way other artists would break

1209
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
And I would try and reverse-engineer that

1210
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
And in figure out

1211
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
Okay this is really interesting

1212
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
YouTube is

1213
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
An amazing tool at the time

1214
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,343
For being discovered because the way their algorithm work

1215
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
Anderson

1216
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
Suggested video

1217
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
Algorithm if you remember right and it's still there

1218
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Today

1219
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Much different now on the right hand side

1220
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
If you be watching a certain video music video it's

1221
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Suggest another artist

1222
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
That's something that we do

1223
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
Took advantage of

1224
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,775
I sat down with logic we would go through the project and I said okay let's identify

1225
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,311
Four five song

1226
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
That we think are singles

1227
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
And we shoot

1228
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
No budget low budget

1229
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Point and shoot

1230
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
Music videos for those

1231
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,599
Because that was that was a way for us to to get more attention to those

1232
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Songs

1233
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
A social media started to come out paying attention

1234
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
Nevada remember

1235
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,279
The very early days of Snapchat

1236
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
What's something that we took advantage of

1237
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
Logic was on there and building

1238
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,471
You know a big audience on on that platform and then Instagram

1239
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Play the role and we try to be

1240
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
First-mover zombie

1241
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
Platforms quicklogic to the great job

1242
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
You know speaking directly to his audience

1243
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,247
It's always about sorry to cut you off in like

1244
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Taking

1245
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,831
Something that's already been done and making it better

1246
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,415
You know I've come recently come out with this thing called freestyle Fridays on my Instagram

1247
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,487
Were you essentially create a perfect Loop of a song

1248
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,791
And it it seems like it's a never-ending

1249
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
Music video that doesn't stop

1250
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:40,447
And I don't necessarily know of anybody who's done that at least not on a mainstream platform

1251
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,239
But it's like finding ways

1252
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
With something that already exists

1253
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
2

1254
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,383
Put your own stamp on it and make people

1255
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,711
Wanted it all that Freestyle Friday thing is that's it just crowdsourcing

1256
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
Logic and I were just having a conversation

1257
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
We came up with the idea

1258
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
Now we we get to go and look at 15000 comments

1259
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,463
And see what their opinion is on the song before we put it out and we can decide

1260
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,279
Hey is that something we want to put out you that make the album or not

1261
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
It sounds like you had

1262
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
A

1263
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
She had to slow build from Thrift mm

1264
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
Before you logic

1265
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
From 2009 but

1266
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Once you enter

1267
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Peter Criss

1268
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,871
Through the first two years were sounds like they were they were focused on building up

1269
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
Keynote the brand awareness like

1270
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Who is

1271
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,271
Making sure people knew who logic was so by the time

1272
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
You put out your first

1273
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Studio record

1274
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
I'm in in 2014 under pressure

1275
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Deborah Kerr

1276
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,255
But I think it debuted or one right to number four on the

1277
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Billboard

1278
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559
Which is like

1279
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,143
Were you guys surprised by the hell you shocked or did you think

1280
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
Yep this is exactly as you planned it

1281
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,471
We were devastated

1282
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
Actually

1283
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,311
I know I I mean

1284
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,639
Legitimately devastated

1285
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
Wait for us it was a number one album

1286
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
Or bust

1287
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
And

1288
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,343
Wait that was a number for record of the Billboard charts

1289
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,647
You were devastated it wasn't number one

1290
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Devastator

1291
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
Because in that was where

1292
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,767
Again looking back

1293
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
I could have done a better job probably

1294
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
At educating

1295
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
The record company

1296
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:19,263
And and making them feel a little bit more involved in the early days as we were building

1297
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
Still very much independently

1298
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
Like we are putting out.

1299
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
Free albums

1300
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Entering the country

1301
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:31,295
At that point I think he had gone on I think you did a great job you did an amazing job

1302
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:36,159
And we were working with people who aren't that company anymore cuz it's like musical chairs who didn't believe in your

1303
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
Are you talking about like

1304
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
By communicating bro you did

1305
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
A fantastic job and

1306
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,351
Say what Chris won't date under ship has

1307
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,727
They didn't believe it in a so much that they under ship my album and you had all these other Hughes artist

1308
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,543
Within a 400000 plus

1309
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
CDs in stores

1310
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
And I had fans

1311
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
Going to Best Buy

1312
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Having

1313
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
You have the workers there go to the back

1314
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
Take it out of the box be

1315
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
Because the entire label didn't believe in us enough

1316
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
Steven by shelf space

1317
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
Not just new release

1318
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Shelf space

1319
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Michelle Smith I just have to say

1320
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,511
Your man bro and you did your job

1321
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,327
I mean I mean

1322
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
The blind person perspective

1323
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
I mean

1324
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Thousands of records that are released

1325
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Every single week around the world

1326
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,543
Like number four on the US Billboard charts

1327
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Fractional

1328
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
A fraction of a fraction

1329
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
Percentage of albums

1330
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,175
Ever get that high

1331
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
That's a huge achievement I mean that

1332
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:36,063
Like even if I believe you that you were sad it wasn't number one but

1333
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,879
It it sounds like you spent the first two years

1334
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,695
Building up the awareness and by the time that album came out

1335
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
It was

1336
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
Can I play was going to sell a record sold a half a million

1337
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Copies I guess

1338
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Eventually

1339
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
Yeah I think it was the first time

1340
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
That we

1341
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,727
Prove to not only ourselves cuz I didn't think we

1342
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
We needed to I think we understood it and

1343
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,591
We believed in and knew what we were building

1344
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,919
Prove to the business and end

1345
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
Really the world that

1346
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,063
What we had built I think a lot of people viewed it as almost like building it in a vac

1347
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,647
I remember having the conversation to be incredibly frustrated

1348
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
You know what the head of sales at the time at Def Jam

1349
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,023
He didn't understand cuz he's like how you have

1350
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
You never sold a song

1351
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
In history

1352
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
Of your career

1353
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Accurate

1354
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
We had sold

1355
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
100000

1356
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
An X number of dollars in merch

1357
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,359
So that's going to translate

1358
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
The expanse who are invested in

1359
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,479
Right at the first time we're asked

1360
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Not even asking we're putting on music

1361
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
For sale

1362
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,087
If they're coming to shows

1363
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
And selling out

1364
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
Rooms across the country

1365
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
Kramer selling out shows all over Europe

1366
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
They're going to buy

1367
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
In album

1368
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
47909 to me it was

1369
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
That was the next logical step is like

1370
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
Okay just the natural progression of his career

1371
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
Now he's a major label artist

1372
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
And we're going to sell music

1373
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
Black Wii U

1374
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
When you perform right

1375
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Are you

1376
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:10,015
Do you feel like you're the same person do you feel like you're sort of a heightened version of yourself

1377
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
Do you feel like you're almost

1378
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,087
Embodiment

1379
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
Character when your arm stay

1380
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
Oh man what a

1381
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,279
Yeah I think I'm be at my purest form in a way

1382
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Like

1383
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
Be the best version of you

1384
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,655
It will not even I think the most vulnerable

1385
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
I used to be so

1386
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,519
Nervous if I would mess up a line or flub here or do this or do that

1387
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
Then you got to realize it's like

1388
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,871
Xiaomi lyrics are in my mind like right now

1389
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
One breath

1390
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:43,039
Get data later I'll hit you with a permit to get better stay down straight shots in a playground living how I'm living with the life that I'm giving anybody is riding with me I'm riding with him

1391
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,903
The enemy enemy enemy second a bit of my getting hit with the ventilator need to attend ever do it I knew it already been through what I do it for the streets

1392
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,439
Preparing for life anybody that's gang related

1393
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:54,559
Like you have any times I haven't met up to to be able to do it like that

1394
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
But it's like I was I was

1395
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
Kicking myself it wasn't

1396
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Good enough I was

1397
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,727
I was Michael Jackson and after the show I was Joe Jackson

1398
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
Looking in the mirror like

1399
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Could you do this

1400
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,591
And then I kind of started to realize like you wouldn't that

1401
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,175
Like I said it was because I thought I was at a time when I needed it

1402
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
Everything had to be perfect but

1403
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
Play one wrong key bro

1404
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
It ain't that deep you know I kiss you have

1405
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Sold-out Arena

1406
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
At the Garden

1407
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,975
People who

1408
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,535
If you make a mistake if anything it makes them

1409
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Steel

1410
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
A further connection to you because

1411
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Is totaling state

1412
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Cuz we are

1413
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,191
So it's definitely a heightened version

1414
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
But a more vulnerable

1415
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
You guys released on the 2nd

1416
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
Studio release was the incredible true story that debuted

1417
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
Number three

1418
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
Charge your third album everybody

1419
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,759
If you say number one and a

1420
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,343
I think I should train plan terms of like your mainstream

1421
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Popularity

1422
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
Maybe

1423
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
Expenses superstardom

1424
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
What's the song one eight hundred two seven three eight

1425
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
255

1426
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
They came out in 2017

1427
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
How did that song come about

1428
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
Oh man it's so crazy so earlier

1429
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,751
With the second album

1430
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
We did a tour

1431
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
Where you know we paid

1432
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
Six figures for a tour bus

1433
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,431
For fans to go to their homes and so

1434
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,247
Surprise them and play them the second album before it was even out

1435
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Add

1436
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
Yeah we ate dinner with these people on meth

1437
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:24,415
Their families and friends and I heard about their hopes and dreams and

1438
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,719
Hard times and happy times in a row

1439
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
The biggest thing

1440
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
That I heard

1441
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:33,631
You know when they would talk about my music I like yeah dude I love your music like it's

1442
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
It goes without saying like

1443
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,959
Make great music and I'm like wow well thank you

1444
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
But they're like

1445
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
That's not it

1446
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
The reason I love

1447
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
You like

1448
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,871
Logic and your brand and what you represent

1449
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Is because of the message

1450
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
You know there's people who are like

1451
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,039
You know you've saved my life your music has saved my life

1452
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
And I after that

1453
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
What about it for a long time I was at you I didn't even

1454
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
Try to do that

1455
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,671
And actually have the

1456
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
How are you do that

1457
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
Could you imagine

1458
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
What that would be like in end and so when I

1459
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
What I wrote it

1460
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
I knew it had to be simple-minded

1461
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,215
Had to be and it just came it just was we were just in the studio and

1462
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
I

1463
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
I had to hook

1464
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
And iiii

1465
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Sang it

1466
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
Then I get the verse

1467
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
And then I knew in my heart I was like

1468
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Pac-Man

1469
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,711
I need other people on this

1470
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,527
And I need other young influential people

1471
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
You know that can can help get this message out mind you I'm not in the studio light yo this song about killing yourself

1472
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,743
I was about to be a banging number one like no

1473
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
Like no way

1474
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
I know but I don't care

1475
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
Nobody saw

1476
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
Like nobody

1477
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:37,887
Saw that

1478
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
And a ninja was Chris

1479
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
Who had the idea

1480
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
To make it one eight hundred two seven five

1481
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,591

Number B

1484
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
Then we could reach people and give them

1485
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
That platform

1486
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
I never had a place

1487
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463

1489
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,071
The name of the song when it hurt to seven three eight two five five.

1490
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,631
Telephone number for the National Suicide Prevention

1491
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399

Phone number looks like

1497
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Suzhou super

Powerful

1499
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Did you know that

1500
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,343
You know hindsight's 20/20

1501
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,927
We could sit here now and be like all of course it could have been but like

1502
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
No like

1503
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,767
What was on the radio I mean it's glorification and

1504
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,423
We knew it was a great song and it's funny cuz in the song comes out and you got people like it's going to do well because in his life

1505
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Get out of here man

1506
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,471
We are not we had no clue

1507
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
Did you

1508
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,639
I understand that you are singing on that record from different

1509
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Perspective

1510
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
Inviting different voices

1511
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
But I'm

1512
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
Did you feel that way to Huber

1513
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Were you ever suicidal in your life

1514
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,087
Here's a crazy

1515
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,159
Thing I've never thought I thought about killing myself

1516
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,695
I've seen I thought about

1517
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Punch a cash register

1518
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
These are intrusive thoughts that

1519
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
Just happened where human

1520
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
Like they happened in there

1521
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
It wasn't until I was

1522
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,143
Experience

1523
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
True depression

1524
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
And didn't even know I was

1525
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Depressed

1526
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
While I was touring

1527
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
And working that

1528
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
That song

1529
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,943
Because everywhere I was going it's suicide suicide suicide talk about killing yourself

1530
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,503
So Def def definitely can you imagine

1531
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Solid gear

1532
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,855
A talking about killing yourself even if you aren't

1533
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
Like talk about killing yourself

1534
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,695
Golf in particular as the artist singing the song but it's like

1535
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,487
Yo and that is

1536
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,559
Is crazy and in going from like I given up on trying

1537
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,215
And I remember telling Chris before that album I was like I'm done I don't want to do it I was always like in the studio trying to make hits

1538
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
It doesn't mean I wasn't trying to make

1539
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,359
The heart beside man I wanted to be Drake and Rick Ross and this I wanted to be that popular guy to

1540
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:59,967
And when I gave up I ended up making the song that did it and

1541
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
Then

1542
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
I kind of was like

1543
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,039
Hello man

1544
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,575
Like I love this I love

1545
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,623
Being in the spotlight and being in the spotlight for a pause

1546
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
Get a message but I just

1547
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Work dating

1548
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Work dating

1549
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,767
Grinded and did it so much while I was waking up every day and

1550
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
I wasn't happy going on

1551
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
And I guess at the end of that

1552
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
Turn towards the end of that

1553
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
Just long starts a tourism

1554
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727

What happened yeah it's

1558
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,455
Crazy Matt so I'm backstage throwing up before I'm going on malnourished

00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
So bored no I wasn't nervous

1562
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Which know I was like

1563
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,647
Panic attack feel like you're out of your body

1564
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
But you you feel like

1565
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:48,095
Like a little person in your brain kind of like you take a swig of water and you're like wait did I actually drink that water

1566
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,167
All right now and it would have come to realize I think it's at home

1567
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,751
A hyper analyzation of the world around you in real time

1568
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,079
And in and that was really hard so I'm going through all this and

1569
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:03,199
You know won't really get too much into it but obviously I was dealing with like relationship issues and

1570
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
I'm trying to manage up

1571
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503

Make albums go on tours in it

1574
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:15,231
And if there was a time where I was even like like I love Chrissy my partner and I want to like quit not quit rap

1575
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,535
I just want to run away but I can't cuz we got

1576
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,583
Multi million dollar deals on the table

1577
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,423
And if I don't do this then it's all going to crumble and he said

1578
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
Sacrificed his life

1579
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:31,359
For me I'm up here it's all the weight on my shoulders I can't I can't I can't do this I can't do that to him

1580
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
I start realizing

1581
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:41,855
My future family and I have to stack this money for my children and I'd come from

1582

Going crazy and you step on stage and you don't want to be there

1585
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,919
They're after nine months I mean think about 9 months on the road

1586
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,967
9 months of hotels 9 months of

1587
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,503
Of Dark Places

1588
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
Behind the scenes in this

1589
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:16,159
And I'm sure I'm a human being and that's something that a lot of people don't understand Fame be like

1590
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Famous crazy

1591
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
And and that's what that was

1592
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
And I didn't go home and

1593
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,375
Shoot guns in Rob this and do and just like to know I went home

1594

01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
I'm going to workout

1597
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
I'm going to eat better

1598
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
And I realize that my goals have

1599
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Have changed

1600
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
You know it's like

1601
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
It's not about money anymore

1602
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
It's about it's about

1603
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
That's why I go do a show

1604
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,319
Just cuz it's going to make me $500,000 in

1605
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,855
An hour onstage like that's

1606
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Great

1607
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,415
But if I'm not there I should

1608
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,951
Want to be honest

1609
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
Now I do not want to be on

1610
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
Cuz I taken

1611
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
Chris how did you

1612
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
How did you

1613
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
Deal with

1614
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
With logic

1615
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,471
Anxiety in and exhaustion and and you know that

1616
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,287
What happened in Pittsburgh like that that wasn't

1617
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,591
I mean obviously that was an expression of

1618
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,663
Things that were probably building up over a long time

1619
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
How did you cope with it

1620
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
What did you do

1621
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,783
I mean I immediately

1622
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
You kind of put on

1623
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
The

1624
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Friend hat

1625
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,623
Right because

1626
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
That's

1627
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
What makes this relationship

1628
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Specials at

1629
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Again yui

1630
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
You generally care about him so

1631
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,583
For me I was a lot of questions about hey

1632
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
How how can I make

1633
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
You feel better and what can I exchange

1634
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
What can we do differently

1635
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,775
To make sure something like this doesn't happen

1636
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,103
Again and we learned a lot from it I think both him and I

1637
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
On how to

1638
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
The move forward in nn

1639
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Conduct the business

1640
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,527
And operate on a daily basis even

1641
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
It is a kind of change

1642
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
A lot of the

1643
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
Things we did from this daily

1644
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Communication

1645
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,743
To what we say yes to to what we say no to

1646
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,023
And I think we're

1647
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Better for it

1648
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
He'll say the same

1649
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Thanks and I think we're going to be

1650
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
Much more successful

1651
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
Moving forward and end

1652
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
It's because

1653
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,543
We got through that and it allowed us to

1654
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
To grow

1655
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
When I think about

1656
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
The business that you guys

1657
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Created

1658
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,807
I'm curious about where it goes

1659
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,343
From here like I think about

1660
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
To write and

1661
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,439
Can I go to Jay-Z

1662
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:30,047
Or to Kanye West like I could buy their company outright and Jay-Z could leave the picture

1663
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
Cuz they're still like

1664
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
An investment

1665
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,167
Our man there's a label and there's other things that

1666
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:39,007
At this point you don't necessarily need Jay-Z the business can thrive

1667
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,639
Right now you have a business around your brand whether it's

1668
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:50,527
Performing or selling merchandise for the tour or reading books or acting all those are

1669
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,343
Are great but they all require you to

1670
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
Constantly stay on

1671
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Hamster wheel

1672
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
Did you get to ever

1673
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,743
Both of you think about

1674
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
How do we

1675
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Build something

1676
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
To the Future that

1677
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
May not require both of

1678
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,935
That can just be a business

1679
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
Is even bigger than

1680
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Will what I think Chris is already done that

1681
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
Envision tees group and and the partners

1682
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,943
Ships that he has why won't speak for you let you say that but

1683
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,271
I even said I have a record label and we're both

1684
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,087
Equal Partners on that that that we run together

1685
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Call Delizia

1686
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
With artist that I've signed

1687
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,975
That we believe in that will go out and essentially

1688
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,583
Make us money

1689
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Those businesses

1690
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
And I think that mind-state

1691
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,055
You like I have a production company and I've really disgusting too much but it's called Bobby boy and these these are things I'm doing my films through in

1692
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,127
And yeah it exactly and so imagine like

1693
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:52,223
If I this production company and I write a script and somebody else

1694
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
Takes the wheel so

1695
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,063
I am looking at the future

1696
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,903
Through still being creative but more so behind the scenes

1697
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
Because I have a

1698
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
Fan base that wants

1699
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Any product

1700
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,423
I am willing to give them as long as they are familiar with where it is coming from

1701
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
So how about you

1702
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,287
I mean the brand logic there's a lot of equity in that

1703
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,871
Young girl my business and and

1704
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,711
Have have use my experience and I think some of the relationships in

1705
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,015
What's important than knowledge and experience

1706
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
But I've

1707
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
Wild

1708
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Building logic

1709
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,647
Career right next to him

1710
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:37,535
I recently took on a handful more clients of a 5/7 management client right now I just

1711
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
I just did

1712
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
Did a joint venture

1713
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
A label with Sony music with a very very excited about

1714
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727
So yeah there there's there's a lot of things

1715
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
Look forward to in

1716
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,335
But one thing I will say though is we kind of did

1717
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
I just question and the question was

1718
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:57,759
What what do we have at we so kind of cuz we have these artists you have these artists we have insurance

1719
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
They're doing things for us

1720
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,623
I can't speak for Chris I like to think I can when I say this

1721
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,903
He said you know that

1722
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,255
Always on the hamster wheel is always going the truth is my brain isn't

1723
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
What does not

1724
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Stop

1725
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,399
And that's how I live so I have to be involved somewhere if I'm not in yet

1726
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:20,799
I trust no one with my money with my company with my visit with my dad if I'm not involved like I trust Chris with my life but

1727
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,663
I'm not just going to be like just go take it not because I don't trust him but because I don't work that

1728
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
I need to know

1729
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,991
How you cook the fries at McDonald's

1730
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:35,647
Who sweeps the floors who flip the burgers the exact time to flip the burgers this this that that even if I'm sitting all the way

1731
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Play on the

1732
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,487
57th floor in the CEO chair I need

1733
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,815
So this is a question that I asked everybody

1734
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
To come to the show and

1735
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Of course I'm going to ask

1736
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
The both of you

1737
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
First Eucharist when you think about the journey that you've taken

1738
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
Are 20 year old no experience like

1739
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
Catching this guy logic

1740
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,615
To where you are now

1741
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
How much about you tribute to

1742
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
Really hard working

1743
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
An intelligence

1744
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Skill

1745
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
And how much of that do tribute

1746
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,367
Probably somewhere in the middle

1747
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Between the ball

1748
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
When I look back

1749
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
Yeah my at my life and I

1750
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
I think being

1751
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
You know raised by my parents

1752
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
Play played a large role in

1753
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Who I am as a person today and

1754
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
Instilling confidence in me

1755
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
How

1756
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
Serendipity

1757
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Played such a role in me

1758
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Discovering

1759
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,335
Logic what I told the story

1760
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,151
If I hadn't been sitting at my computer at that very moment

1761
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,943
To click that

1762
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
YouTube link and see the video of logic I don't think

1763
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
I think we'd be sitting here today

1764
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
But there's a lot

1765
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
Large portion of that wear

1766
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
You know it it's a

1767
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
Just takes in in

1768
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,975
Almost unimaginable amount of hard work

1769
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,767
And perseverance

1770
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,303
Because of every roadblock

1771
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Door that's

1772
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Closed

1773
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,399
To figure out a way to

1774
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,191
Get through it

1775
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
I think

1776
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,287
If it lives somewhere in the middle I think my journey

1777
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
I would I would probably have one foot in

1778
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,895
Hard work and intelligence in

1779
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Grind and hustle

1780
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,455
And one foot in

1781
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
Pure and simple lock

1782
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
Logic

1783
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,879
Yeah I mean I think it's in the beginning it's a

1784
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
A lot of luck

1785
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
Reykjavik

1786
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
Without that lucky wouldn't even be blessed enough to

1787
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,559
To be a nurse positions in those situations

1788
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,887
You know what's really funny I can't speak for other

1789
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,447
Famous people celebrities musicians

1790
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,495
Whatever but I can tell you like

1791
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
No one knows how hard I

1792
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,335
And until you how are we can work

1793
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895

1794
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Salary to to my employees

1795
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Year

1796
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
This is a real

1797
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Real company

1798
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,551
Hard work

1799
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,111
You work hard every mother F day

Play we work on everyone

1801
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,255
I work hard every mother

1802
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,711
That's logic AKA Bobby turn

1803
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,551
Tito AKA young Sinatra AKA Sir Robert

1804
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
Bryson Hall II and Chris ceru founder of visionary music group just spiked

1805
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,231
The success of logic music

1806
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,791
Both Chris and logic are relying on

1807
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:28,191
Old business strategy to keep the business relevant that would be the strategy of diversification

1808
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:32,543
In addition to working on a new record Logix writing a book and

1809

Bruce Park

1811
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,663
Chris has taken on several new artists to manage

1812
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,223
Cleaning up and comers like Jon Bellion

1813

AOK mentioned earlier Chris is launching a joint venture with Sony to build

1815
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
Brand new label

Hey thanks so much for sticking around beak

1831
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,791
I know for how you built that and today were updating us

1832
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,839
2 years ago

1833
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:34,239
I'm a woman in Stateline Nevada my name is Cassie Burnside and I'm the owner and founder of fatco

1834
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
Backhoe

1835
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
And why would

1836
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,103
Anyone want to put the word fat

1837
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
Into the name of their startup

1838
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Well

1839
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,223
You have to go back a bit because of about 7 years ago

1840
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Cassie

1841
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
Starting to notice

1842
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
Thing that kind of bugged her

1843
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:52,671
I would go shopping and I would look at labels and look at ingredient panels

1844
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,255
And not be able to read or pronounce anything

1845
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,583
I had no idea what these ingredients were

1846
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,423
Especially bothered by products that go directly onto your skin

1847
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Deodorant

1848
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,055
Lotions and creams but then she thought maybe I can make some of those things

1849
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
Used to Know

1850
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
Old fashioned ingredients

1851
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:18,015
Those were ingredients that we used a lot in soap making Orbeez the Latin candle making

1852
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,879
And I started wondering like why don't we use them anymore why did those things go away

1853
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
And here is where

1854
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Fat comes in

1855
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,511
Because Cassie realize that animal fat

1856
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,327
If used to be a main ingredient in things like

1857
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,607
Soap and lotion

1858
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
And so she decided that make skin products with

1859
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
Beef tallow

1860
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,311
The fat from a cow chop it up and you cook it low and slow

1861
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,383
And rendered Tallow is the liquid fat

1862
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,663
It rips off of that

1863
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
Hard factoring that rendering process

1864
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
Just to be clear

1865
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:55,391
Cassie does not do this at home she gets her towel from a company in Colorado that specializes in red

1866
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
Rendered fat

1867
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,231
And then she mixes the fat with other oils

1868
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,303
Fragrances to make things like body butter and lotion

1869
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,887
They're nursing their nutrient dense

1870
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,959
They're very concentrated and a little goes a long way

1871
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Cassie said she took a

1872
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,287
Big risk five years ago when she

1873
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
Quit her engineering job

1874
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591

01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,199

1881
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
January 2018

1882
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,111
Target started selling fatco products

1883
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,207
As for all the friends and family who told her this would never work

1884
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,767
They are not saying that anymore

1885
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
Even my mom told me I was a little crazy but now she's our biggest fan she will go to her grave saying she was customer one for

1886
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
