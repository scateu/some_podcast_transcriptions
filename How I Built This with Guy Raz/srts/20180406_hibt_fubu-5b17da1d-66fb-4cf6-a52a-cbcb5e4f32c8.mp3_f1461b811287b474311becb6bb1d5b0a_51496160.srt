$300,000 worth of orders

14

How are you going

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
That was a big question I didn't know what I didn't know

16
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
I didn't have any Financial education

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
I didn't even have an accountant at the time

18
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
So I went to

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,984
All the banks I could and I got turned down by 27 of them

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
7 bags

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032

How I built this show about entrepreneurs idealist stories

24
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Waiting tables at Red Lobster to buildings

25
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,776

Dress with any

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,784
There's some disagreement over what am I

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Tell you but

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
By and large

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Lots

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
Some people will say that hip hop

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Was born in

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
The Bronx probably in 19

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
33

35
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
The center of Hip Hop

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Foremost

37
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
The decade

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
By the early eighties

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Hip hop center of gravity started to show

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Queen

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Physically a neighborhood in Queens

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
Call Hollis

43
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Neighborhood

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Who are some of the most influential

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Hip hop grew up

46
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Russell Simmons

47
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Cool J and

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
And of course all

49
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
3 members of Run DMC

50
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
Remember their song Christmas

51
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
How is gyro

52
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
The favor

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Acacia Hollis

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
Kind of crucial to understanding how Daymond John

55
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
Was able to build a global brand of hip-hop

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
A friend

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
Started from the trunk of his car

58
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Because it's

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Hip hop culture started TX

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Explode

61
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
So too did demons little clothing label

62
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Bull called boo boo

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
It's a brand that

64
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
To date

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Has sold over 6

66
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Billion dollars

67
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Apparel note today

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
You might have Daemon as one of the sharks

69
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Shark Tank

70
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Confident

71
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Smart

72
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Trust

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
But you might not know about

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Childhood in Hollis

75
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Challenges he faced

76
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Very early age

77
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Right around my

78
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
About 11 years old at 12 years old my parents separated got a divorce and I would never see or speak to my father of ever again so

79
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
So you haven't seen your dad

80
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
I did not

81
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
And so it was just

82
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
You and your mama

83
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
Just me and my mom struggling trying to work it out

84
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
And how does she make a living

85
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
Obama is an executive assistant so she worked for Lehman Brothers

86
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
American Express

87
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
As you have her little side hustle she would probably

88
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
You know so close and try to sell them

89
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Shugo and open up volume

90
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
You know maybe a little kiosk at a flea market and buy goods and resell them

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
So mama do a whole bunch of

92
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
Things such as that to make some extra hands me but you would also just

93
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
Mainly be a secretary or exact

94
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
2

95
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
You're growing up

96
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Bncollege

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Listen to late 70s

98
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Pleiades

99
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
It was kind of a tough

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Neighborhood

101
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Did you feel

102
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Paranormal

103
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Childhood

104
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
I fell save it was a great time it was or what I think is the last of those old-school neighborhoods where everybody knew

105
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Each other in

106
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,064
You know you know all the kids have to go inside before the lights came on on the

107
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
On the street lights I mean my mother used to always say I have to be either

108
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
Faster than the Concorde go faster than the

109
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
The lights on the Empire State Building in

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
And the reason was that

111
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
The Concorde Woodland

112
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Approximately I think 7:50 or 7:30

113
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
You know during the night

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
At JFK so when we all the kids her the ground

115
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Rumble

116
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Because the Concorde Landing you had

117
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Do you have to be

118
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Be in the house by the time that rumbling

119
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Stop

120
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
But during the winter months when you know it is still landing at late at night but yet it was getting dark at 5

121
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
As you say you need to be home by the time you see the lights come on on the Empire State Building

122
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
So it was very

123
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,863
Great Community you know a lot of barbecues and cookouts and and fun stuff like that but

124
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
That would all change around 86

125
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
I-87

126
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Or we stop feeling safe when

127
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Trackside is a devastating

128
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
You know our neighborhoods and we would start hearing of death

129
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Send

130
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
And things are nation that maybe that's because I'm

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
At 16 or 18 years old and up

132
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,855
You know when I'm driving and I'm seeing more of the world but also crack was starting to devastate

133
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
Every neighborhood across

134
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
The country

135
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
So how are you living

136
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
In the neighborhood environment where

137
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
You got the crack epidemic

138
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Friends who work

139
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Getting caught up in

140
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Selling drugs in

141
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
How are you able to

142
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
I do voices

143
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
I wasn't someone analytical and

144
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
I remember doing the math one day about you know if I would have work at McDonald's in about a sell drugs over the course of five years where

145
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
When I make more money and it look

146
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Like I'll make my money

147
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Because if you look at the drug dealer who

148
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,511
Has to pay for all the attorney fees and everything else every once in awhile to get

149
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
According to be out of five years if they had this

150
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Just stay in jail

151
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Two and a half

152
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,447
But three of those years in the wind and then you have to look over your shoulder and you end up dead

153
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
Maybe dad then how

154
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,359
And they have no medical how much really would they bringing home how much are they letting so I look for that nice a long

155
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
I'd rather working me down

156
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Yuan

157
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Dedicated to you

158
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Dream about

159
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
The things that you

160
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
The kind of person

161
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
Early on in life I really dream that I wanted to be maybe a pilot

162
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
I really didn't know what else I wanted to be in life you know I had no idea

163
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,679
Until rap music really started coming around and I figured I wanted to be

164
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
Working and rap music and but I didn't know how to do that if I couldn't wrap Sam dancer

165
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Reproduce I really do know how to do that I try what I could dance a little bit I actually did do some kind of dancing hope

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Run DMC your

167
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
What LL Cool J Russell Simmons with discover me

168
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
At one point I did get an offer

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
To dance

170
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
For a group name Houdini

171
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
And my mother said no way in the world are you going on

172
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
It sounds like you were

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
A pretty good kid

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
But you didn't really

175
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Ravel

176
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
No I

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
I think I may have one or two arguing

178
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199
Maybe I'm a bit maybe now I'm 49

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
I've had three arguments with her and 49 glasses

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Probably

181
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Yeah probably

182
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Two of them were

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
When I was in my

184
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Did you

185
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Was

186
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Was College ever something

187
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
You

188
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
I did I did consider now but I'm dyslexic

189
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
And reading all week

190
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
Challenge science and math no problem I can do in my sleep

191
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
That was a challenge and I said to myself I'm going to take off one year

192
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Neil getting out of

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Are the school lights

194
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Take off one year

195
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
And that one year became

196
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
5 years 10 years

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
So are you doing in that in that

198
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,391
And that time I was working here and there but I also was

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Farting

200
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
Do you know dating as many girls as I could you know the normal

201
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Kid thing you know

202
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
18 to

203
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
20

204
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
I turn around again I looked I said I don't have anything

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
And not only do I not have anything

206
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
I don't even have an education to fall back on

207
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
So

208
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
Again looking at all the friends I lost

209
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
And then talk about all this all the kids I thought we're not so bright but yet they were coming back from college and I was away

210
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Waiter in Red Lobster serving them

211
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
And I said maybe I'm the idiot here

212
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
You are waiting at Red Lobster

213
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
I was a waiter yet

214
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
I was having a great time as a waiter but I was also learning from relapsing you know they will issue these Corley books on your nose

215
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,911
Are there pianos basically what was working what wasn't working I was

216
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
Do you know learning how to serve people reading their quarterly p&l

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
When you were later I mean

218
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
How many Waiters

219
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Red Lobster any company

220
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,735
I don't know but that's not my problem I was reading it

221
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
So you are clearly

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Thinking of

223
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
If you are waiting tables

224
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
And you're reading their quarterly reports in there

225
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Piano Tiles like

226
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
You're doing this because you have a plan

227
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
Did you have a play

228
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
I didn't know what the plan is going to be but I neither just like working out every single day and just like anything else trying to educate my

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Myself I had the

230
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Ability to put

231
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
Various different things in my body or my mind you know drugs and rock and roll and rap music and drinking all the

232
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
How productive I was going to be later on or I can

233
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Can put in

234
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
P&l statements in listen to Tony Robbins and listen to Jay Abraham and

235
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Think and Grow Rich in the 7 highly effective habits of whatever no people

236
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Tony Robinson reading

237
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Stephen Covey

238
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
All day

239
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
All day everyday that's what I was going to

240
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
That's when I was 16

241
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
And it's not that it was easy it got darker and darker and ugly and all that I question myself and say that I am I doing

242
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,183
On the right thing am I on the right path cuz I bet of the day I saw that I just wanted to be

243
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
Someone who can take care of their family and have a decent house in

244
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
I wasn't sure what kind of business I was going to have if you was going to business be a business at all but I wanted to have a steady income I didn't have an address

245
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
You know just be roaming the streets

246
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
And how does this idea of making

247
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Apparel

248
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Google how does a

249
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
What's

250
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Story

251
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Well

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Show

253
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
The funny story is that I will talk about that with my girlfriend at the

254
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
The time I was living with all

255
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,671
A little bit older than me she was 30 I think I was 20

256
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Think she works

257
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
For America

258
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Express in one of them

259
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
And very supportive but I would give her my ideas old timing

260
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
And I remember

261
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
She would laugh at some of them

262
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,079
And then one day I asked to borrow $800 and I asked her to borrow $500 i d i had call Fubu

263
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
And she said no

264
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
I would leave her after that of course

265
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
I left her after that

266
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Remember maybe about

267
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,647
15 years ago or something she she's so my friend but she came to my office and she

268
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
She heard my secretary talk about my houses and all the type of stuff that

269
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,327
We have to take care of from a financial standpoint in the wire the money and she was like

270
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
You still want that $500 or Fubu

271
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
But that was a super a person

272
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Okay so hot

273
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
How did you come up with the idea for Fubu

274
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Show

275
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,759
You know we was I was spending so much money going out and buying clothes that

276
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
That that the Hip Hop Community love

277
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
To buy and they could be

278
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
Ski jackets Timberland boots whatever the case is and we start to hear rumors that you know

279
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,631
Clothing Cummins apparel, just didn't want rappers African-Americans inner-city kids whoever

280
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
They don't want people wearing their clothes

281
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
But what I saw to get fed up to hear about all these type of Brands and I want to create a brand that love them

282
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
I respected the people who loved and respected hip-hop and I called it fool

283
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
For us by us for us

284
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
And you so what it was the

285
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
The first

286
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Barcode clothing

287
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
Well I didn't make anything at first be very honest when I first did I got a bunch of labels and I just went and bought a championship

288
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
I just put

289
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,631
My fubo on top of the champion cut labels printed that's a FUBU owner

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
And I just warm on top of my championships just because I wanted somebody to say I didn't want any weight even though it was mine

291
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
It was just one shirt

292
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,919
It's not like I can resell it to somebody cuz this is us $3

293
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
What the championship

294
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Shirt for $30

295
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
I just tagged all the clothes I have

296
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
And then I I saw to see this hat that was on on a lot of these rappers and it didn't look like it was made by

297
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Amazing clothing company and they look like a

298
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,935
A ski cap not with a ball on the top with a little tied like a string on the top

299
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
And I I knew how to make those my mother showed me how to make those

300
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
Because the first one I bought was about $20 and went all the time and had and I couldn't find it anywhere when I finally found if you had

301
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
The cast of tolls I pay $30 for this thing

302
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
And I showed my mother that had she said you know you can't afford to just

303
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
You pay that kind of money for something you can make for

304
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
$2

305
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Anaheim

306
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
She told me to go to the store and get some fabric

307
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
I went to so I got $40 worth of Erica came back

308
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
Sore bunch of hats and now all of a sudden

309
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
I wasn't thinking from a commercial

310
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Standpoint yeah

311
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,239
What about the same role of fabric so I have now this big roll of

312
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Stripes fabric

313
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
And I made a tea hats

314
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
So I decide to go

315
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Stand on the corner and sell them

316
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
So you brought this roll of fabric home

317
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
And what

318
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
You like cut-out patterns and

319
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Still really easy you know about the pat it wasn't even bad it was just a straight square like the square you fold it over

320
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
Isa one side and then you

321
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,791
You flipping in now so and then you sold on the top and you tied a string on top

322
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
You're done

323
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
You just have to sew a straight line

324
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
It was one square with one straight line

325
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
And then you just

326
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Ties on top and

327
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
There you go you had the same exact look

328
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
It was like making the bike taking a sleeve

329
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,711
Right and folding it in half and using the part you know and then putting on your head and the top is open

330
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Can you just tile a string

331
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Those just like

332
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Those are really

333
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Popular

334
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Big Lots of

335
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
Play classic hip-hop artists whose kids were wearing those cuz hat

336
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,071
Yes and nobody and no major corporations making so there's no place to find them so where do you find them

337
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
With guys like me so I'm on the street corner

338
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
So I made 80 of them

339
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
It took me probably about

340
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,823
3 hours meat of them and I hit that I hit that street corner and I sold all of

341
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
Do you know a lot of people don't know a lot of people maybe listen to this and they may not live in a

342
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
Condensed area but trust me

343
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,367
Outside my house I went to the shopping area

344
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Nassau coliseum Mall

345
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
What people actually going into shop

346
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
So I quit people are they walking in that mall and all of them

347
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
By standing on the corner

348
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
End

349
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Did you do the hats have

350
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Fubu

351
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
The food label on them at that point I did

352
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
I put the FUBU logo on on the front of a hat

353
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
And people buy them and how much

354
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
I saw of a 20 but if you didn't have 20 it would be 17 and F 17 to 15 minutes

355
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
2 $3

356
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
To $3 I don't think so cuz I bought

357
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,767
I bought $40 worth of very pretty 80s so that means you fifty cents

358
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
Seacomm home at night and you must be

359
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
That's something

360
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
Well I was on the way home I remember County I'm running I was so excited, nobody I just couldn't believe that I asked

361
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,455
Came up with the concept and I sold it and I was it was depending on whether I

362
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
I can sell it or not and then I just looked up

Making more hats

404
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
And then

405
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
He decides to

406
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Branch out

407
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535

408
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
I study really you know refine the way I made the pass get better

409
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,215
Quality hats you know get better food with logos on them

410
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
And then start to put t-shirts there and then starts lky can't

411
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Just hang out here in the mall

412
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
And sell these t-shirts so

413
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,479
Where can I get a booth out of where can I go to so I started to look at other places

414
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,831
Suzanne Outlets can I start a walking over the stores that were outside that mall saying hey

415
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
I'm usually outside this morning the weekends but if I can't be here

416
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
Can I put some shirts in your place or hats a new place on consignment

417
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,119
So I just thought I'd try to figure any and every way out that I can increase my sales

418
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Lowe's and my exposure

419
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167

Just going to like shops and buy a

423
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Yeah I was going to physical shops down on the Delancey Street area or people knew they can go and buy shirts and then I was

424
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Starting to order as many catalogs

425
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
I could of people that way

426
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Selling sweatshirts so like CCM the Jersey company wood

427
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
Sell CCM Jersey or blank or I will go to Boulder the boulder company in

428
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,815
Boulder Colorado they would sell sweatshirt so I would just talk to source as many places I could

429
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
My something of high quality

430
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
That was that had no name on it and they're using it for that purpose are premium come

431
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
The same company that would sell it to any

432
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
A large

433
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Large, so you can play

434
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Put your company name or logo

435
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
And you were

436
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Literally

437
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Showing the labels on

438
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,759
I was ripping old labels out I was sewing these labels in

439
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:39,135
I would then started going to screen printers and start putting screen printing on the shirts

440
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,231
Then the next step after that was to go to embroidery places

441
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,583
To start embroidering the shirt to get a high-quality I was out I kept improving the product

442
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Improving the quality

443
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
And basically see the resistance or the acceptance of customers what level would they buy it at how much do they pay

444
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
30

445
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
6090

446
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,687
Did they like extra large large red I wanted to just really start to understand the customer so I had to keep

447
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Keep going back in time

448
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Improving whatever I was doing

449
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
And I mean this is like

450
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Free internet

451
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063

452
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343

Places

458
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
They were willing to

459
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Do this for you

460
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Yellow Pages cold-calling if you drive into New York City you'll see some sign on a bridge to say

461
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
New Jersey the embroidery capital of the

462
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
Embroidery capital of the world so what do I do I take a train to New Jersey I start walking around outside walking around saying

463
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,415
You know embroidery place so you know embroidery place I mean just not stopping getting up at 6 in the morning and just hitting the subway

464
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
All the while working at Red Lobster night

465
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
All the while working Red Lobster at night and sewing the hats and delivering the hats at the same time and trying the source the

466
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
The goods

467
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
Yeah I mean just but enjoying it when I was doing was kind of like this this new discovery this path that I was going down.

468
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
I was just so excited about

469
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
And to say that I also have to say that through 89 and 92 I close the business 3 times

470
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Because I ran out of money

471
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
Cuz all these development course all the gas all this going on those trains and cars to go in his place

472
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Places I would run out of money

473
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
But

474
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
I would I would only run out of like a $500 a thousand dollars and before you know it you know I walking on the Block somewhere

475
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
Say hey aren't you the little kid that sells food once again I need some more been looking for you

476
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
I need some more

477
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,480
And I will keep opening the business back up because the business started to call me instead of me calling the business

478
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Did you ever

479
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
Get like were you ever in this

480
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Situation where you were

481
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Selling

482
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Stephanie

483
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Street corner and

484
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
City officials came up

485
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Termidor or

486
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,328
Yeah I mean that had happened once or twice but the best permit ever when you're selling

487
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
Stuff on the streets is being able to run faster than them

488
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
The Great Pyramid

489
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
It's okay it's okay there's there's clearly a demand

490
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
On the street for your clothes at

491
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
When did you decide it was

492
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Who sang take it to the next level

493
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
So when I finally got to the level of 1992 and my friend Jay Alexander came back and finding dead

494
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Storm and he had had a

495
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Couple dollars

496
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
She said I want to put in some money and I want you to take this thing serious

497
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,536
Am I playing at that time do the neighborhood was

498
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
The big black guys in the neighborhood

499
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
They had little

500
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Options on

501
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
What they can have to be very stylish

502
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
So they had to go to Rochester Big & Tall

503
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
Or and get a big white shirt or a black shirt or

504
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
They had to pay a lot of money to get this tub custom made for

505
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,528
Play nobody was really making you some really tall or heavy

506
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
You're right

507
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,184
Right so what we did was we just found a place that made 4X 5x 6x

508
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
6X shirts and we made $20 shirts

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Because

510
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,144
We mate with them cuz we knew that if we gave these guys t-shirts these guys are normally bodyguard

511
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:09,056
Not all of my cards right but the ones we did get where The Bodyguard they were in front of the clubs they will bouncers or something like that

512
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,688
I knew that they would not just wear it once and do something with some else like the more stylish kids who don't want to be seen in something

513
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Twice we knew these guys who wear it

514
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Forever wow

515
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
So that was our first plan of attack for the first 6 months get the same 20 shirts out to these guys and

516
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
That's what we did

517
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
And we just would do that and before you know it

518
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
These guys are walking Billboards and the artist started say

519
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
What am I chopped liver

520
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Why you giving it to you know this guy over here and I can't get there like well I don't know we don't really make you decide you're not going to really we're not

521
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Are you sure

522
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
Yeah I'm sure

523
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Now that was out that was a strategy

524
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
When we first touch really launching

525
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
People I mean at that point

526
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
People like

527
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
Do they know if people still sing

528
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
What is a spoof

529
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:01,024
They started to know a little bit about it in the tight Community we're at and then I'm

530
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
This one thing they're just put me on the map was we would dress

531
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,680
D23 bodyguards at work for a guy in New York named Ralph

532
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
McDaniels

533
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
And Route me can you show video music box

534
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
Texas probably

535
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
I've been on longer than MTV I came out the same year

536
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
And Ralph is really known for breaking most

537
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Of the music artist

538
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
From I would say 85 all the way to

539
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
298 date

540
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
All had to

541
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
Really really beg him to go on his show

542
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
And I'm we put on the bodyguards around Ralph and we found out

543
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
The Ralph is going to

544
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
To Teddy Riley

545
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
Concert with Teddy Riley had a weekend that he's throwing Virginia

546
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
So we said I wouldn't take the train down there

547
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Because we know

548
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
He's not going to know as many people in Virginia

549
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
So where billy gets around easier and we got to Ralph and he said I'm only looking at yourself I know who you are I want to put you on my show

550
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Wow

551
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
And dumb he did this interview with us and I was so sweet was so scared to death but he told everybody that you know

552
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
Who was the next best thing I think we had

553
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
I think we have 50 shirts

554
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,912
And I'll Ralph so much as being one of my mentors and somebody was a mental that the to the community that

555
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,496
If he really put us out there and after that all the rappers

556
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
All of them

557
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
We're ready to wear ice up because Ralph

558
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Davis

559
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Thumbs up

560
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
So I guess around the time

561
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
This is becoming bigger

562
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
You start to realize that

563
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
This has

564
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Potential to become

565
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
More than just

566
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Side project obviously

567
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,280
Yeah so what was your next move how did how are you able to

568
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Garrett Morris

569
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,656
When I was about time for my game face on and it was about time to

570
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
Start looking at the numbers and being a real businessman even though I wasn't

571
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
So I started to

572
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Put this plan together on how many retail stores would take my product how many we can ship and start taking out ads

573
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,272
Add session right on in Black Beat magazine and how can we start shipping these

574
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Shirts across the country

575
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
And also how many

576
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:07,744
Street corners can we saw them on with the Inn in regards to flea markets the street corners and I started to do that

577
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,096
I saw to reduce my hours at Red Lobster and I saw to put in more hours here

578
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:17,216
And then I then I saw to bring in two and three other partners to help with the man hours that we need

579
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Accept all that would require a lot of money

580
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
That would require a lot of money at first so of course you know like like many businesses I leverage my credit cards

581
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,320
You know up until I think my partners and I all of us leverage our credit cards are still be about $50,000

582
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,416
I'm with a very high interest rate which is not the smartest thing to do

583
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
And then it all culminated to when I

584
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
Decide to go out to the magic trade show in Las Vegas

585
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
Issa famous like industry

586
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
Betrayed show where

587
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Apparel and stuff

588
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,984
Yeah so it's the magic trade show the magic stands for men's apparel

589
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
Guild in California is held in Nevada

590
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
I know I'm a little confused out of myself

591
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
But that's where all the stores go twice a year and they basically say you know that they'll go and see you

592
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,136
Ralph Lauren store Nikes your food was of the world no say okay this is what we want to come in for spring as well wind coming from

593
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
False

594
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
And as I go out to that show

595
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
My friends and I would

596
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,120
Scrape around money and we're all going buddy passes and stand by my mother having to work for American Airlines.

597
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
The time so

598
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,544
We all flew into Las Vegas California Nevada and took the bus is over because it was too busy to go into

599
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Vegas being on standby

600
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,176
I only got a small hotel room a couple of miles away from the the

601
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,064
The trade show and we put our clothes on the corner of the hotel room stuff in the beds

602
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Inanna

603
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
On the floor

604
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,976
And we will sneak into the magic trade show show

605
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,840
Now we didn't have a boo-boo didn't even have passes to go into those past that we probably had

606
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
You know

607
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
We probably each one of us had on us maybe $30

608
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
A piece about time we got there

609
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
So we sneak into the tray show

610
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
If you would just go so you

611
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,408
You didn't have a boost there but you would just go around and talk to

612
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
People

613
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
About your shirts

614
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,552
I would have the football on and I will see brands that I felt

615
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
We're like ours so if I was you Timberlin or whatever the case is

616
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,768
A stand aside their booth and say hey how you doing I would say

617
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
The forest by herself

618
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
You're here where are you

619
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,592
I want well instead of walking on my balls you want to hop in a cab or a bus cuz my booth is over the Mirage Hotel

620
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
Oh no no no

621
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
No no no not really in the room

622
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,648
It worked it out and you know we would write $300,000 in orders and that's what I would realize

623
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
How much capital I really needed

624
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,512
You walk away from that show without even a booth

625
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
$300,000

626
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
How are you going to find

627
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
That was a big question I didn't know what I didn't know

628
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
And I wasn't part of that time knowing all the things I know now I wasn't part of the Chamber of Commerce I didn't have an affair

629
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Financial education

630
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
I didn't even have an accountant at the time

631
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
So I want to

632
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
All the banks I could and I got turned down my 27 of them you you said have that this business and and can I get a loan

633
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
Yeah I didn't know how to fill out a loan application I didn't know how to

634
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
You know much about reading pianos how can I write a p&l on a business that I never have grown past you know

635
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:30,240
2200 shirts at a time or 5,000 shows at a time right I don't know how to protect what

636
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
$300,000 would it would turn to

637
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
And I kicked in turned down by Banks

638
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Entice

639
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
7 bags

640
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Yeah

641
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
It was so bad long shots for turning me down

642
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,344
Because I'm happy I mean you were I guess in your

643
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Mid 20s

644
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,744
Make it home with your mom and her looking at you you had no

645
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
Sort of History having a business of their thinking

646
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Apus risk

647
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
Why would they take the risk I had I had no Financial intelligence I had no history in this business I had

648
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
You know

649
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:09,664
I had really Daikin collateralized the home I could I didn't do it at the time cuz my mother wasn't allowing me

650
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
To going to put that up and risk so

651
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
You know why I don't blame them I would have gave myself the money

652
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
And then my mother remember coming home and she came home she said

653
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
You know you've been working on this house as long as I have you put as much money as you put into this house and we have some equity in the

654
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
This house and we need to go out

655
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,496
And I wouldn't do this if you didn't have $300,000 in orders cuz it's all we have

656
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,080
Let's go out in the steak out as much Equity as we can in this house

657
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,968
I want you to sell the clothes you put the money right back and then you're going to hopefully you'll have a nice profit

658
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
So she goes out and she gets up

659
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
$100,000 loan on our house

660
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
So your mom

661
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Really

662
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
Have a crazy risk that you took

663
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
Sheep sheep really believe

664
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
This is going to work

665
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
It was a really big risk

666
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
So

667
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
I don't know anything about manufacturing I mean stuff about you know putting an embroidery on a t-shirt stuff like that but as far as

668
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,360
Cuz I know I've only heard about manufacturing is over in China but

669
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,432
I'm not going to risk my money over in China show

670
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
What happens if my mother moves out

671
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
My friends all move in my house

672
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,880
So we start the early start all paying $75

673
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
A week for the room that they would rent out of my house so I have now 6

674
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
6 friends all living in my home

675
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
And

676
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
All the furniture I couldn't sell

677
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,168
I took on the backyard and we will chop it up and we burned it all

678
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,752
In the backyard because we wanted to make room in the house

679
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,128
For selling machines because we were going to trust a $100,000 around money

680
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,224
Overseas with somebody we don't know cuz we knew that we

681
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
We just weren't sharp in that area

682
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Joey

683
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Get all the sewing machines will get a Cutting Room we hired

684
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,024
We hire a bunch of seamstresses and we hire somebody to cut the fabrics and trim the fabrics and we create a factory in the middle

685
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Animal Hollis Queens

686
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
You decide that you are

687
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
You are going to be the factory

688
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Facilities disorder

689
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,544
My house is a big version of Airbnb meatzza Factory

690
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
How exactly

691
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Did you have to work today

692
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Just to fulfill those orders

693
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
It was hard I think we

694
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
We filled about

695
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,672
$75,000 worth of those orders until I turned around and I only had

696
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
$500 left in the bank

697
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
And I was about

698
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
4 months late on the mortgage

699
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:42,240
Again I didn't have Financial intelligence at the time and what was happening was I was paying for the setup of the machines

700
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,824
And bringing all the world Goods here so I had to pay for all that in advance

701
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,968
Then I was paying for the salaries of the people that will working there for me and that money was going out

702
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,600
The stores when they receive the goods they want to pay you for 15 30 60 90 days

703
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,768
And my lack of financial intelligence was starting to just underline how disc

704
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Company was never going to go anywhere and now

705
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
I made $70,000 worth of the goods that I have a

706
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,472
The $300,000 order on in the stores are starting to say

707
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
You're not delivering to some time we're going to start canceling orders

708
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
So this is like

709
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
What like 95-96

710
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,944
Yeah this is right around 95

711
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
It sounds like you're

712
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
You're supposed to like

713
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
I'm both going bankrupt and losing the house

714
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:35,232
And losing all the orders that I had those stores are not going to trust me again because if they're waiting

715
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,072
Six months for something to come in the one they give you these orders

716
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,424
This is the order that they're not giving somebody else they could be turning other Goods

717
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,032
So now they're losing faith in me and

718
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
You got to be yellow

719
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,176
It was a really really dark time and I see this a lot now and entrepreneurs who don't realize what they don't know

720
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
So are you

721
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Were you panicking

722
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,184
Yeah how I was panicking house value for sure how big I didn't know I didn't know how to get out of it and then my mother comes over to

723
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Simon says I have a I have an idea

724
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
And I said

725
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
What she said

726
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
You need a strategic partner

727
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
And I said

728
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
What the hell is a strategic

729
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
And

730
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,008
She said it's OPM Damon you know

731
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,896
Opium don't have to be other people's money to be other people's manufacturing mine Powerman power

732
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Marketing

733
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
I said alright well what do you mean

734
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
She said I need $2,000

735
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
So I don't have to download to go back to the Red Lobster and I work for a month

736
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,952
Can I come back on my give her $2,000 so what you going to do with the money

737
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Cuz imma take a nap in the newspaper

738
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:45,632
And I said that's that could be the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life

739
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
Like asking people if they want to

740
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Fund York

741
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Classified ads

742
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
And what is the ad say

743
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
Million dollars in orders need financing

744
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
What happened to

745
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
People start calling the number

746
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,088
Yasso 33 people call that ad

747
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
30

748
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,696
125% interest

749
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,744
I live in the Attic with collateral

Pictures of loved ones in case I got lost you know offer they can't refuse either loan sharks

751
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,936
Yeah but three of them were real and one is a

752
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
One with Samsung

753
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
Samsung like the Korean

754
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,664
200 billion dollar privately-held complaint Korean conglomerate

755
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,736
Somebody at Samsung saw that classified as

756
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,344
Samsung the head of Samsung's textile division

757
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,952
Because Samsung makes everything from nuclear reactors the cars the phones

758
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,768
And the text Oliver desorden said

759
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,632
Hey wanted to come in I like this opportunity here we we Finance textiles

760
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
And the deal with us was

761
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
That they would Finance the manufacturer in manufacturing and distribution of our product but we had to self buy milk

762
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
Billion dollars worth of clothes in 3 years to keep the deal

763
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Wow invincible

764
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,296
You went there to meet with them and it was the person that you that was in New York

765
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,904
Yeah of course I was nervous I wanted presented you know I brought my mother with me

766
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,536
The later on you know my partner has a Samsung I would say you know

767
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
First man you ever had for a potential investment or whatever structure that somebody brings her mom like Iowa

768
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
Well miles pretty smart so I'm going to bring her with me

769
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:32,640
And you know I didn't think I was going to hit 5 million dollars worth of clothes in three years I barely even sold the first 300.

770
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
What the clothes

771
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:40,576
But I had known my customers so well because of all those things that I was doing that as we started to put the brand out there we

772
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
We did about 30 million dollars in 3 months

773
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
So Samsung of this huge

774
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Textile manufacturer all of a sudden

775
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,304
Making your clothes and distributing it

776
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
What you're going from like

777
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
A tiny little

778
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
Mom Pasha to working with the biggest

779
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Excel

780
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Make her one of the biggest in the world

781
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
Yeah but I mean the work was still up to us who they were just financing that we still had the market even though they had to manufacture they manufacture

782
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224
In a source of funding the manufacturer

783
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
And we have to find the

784
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
And we have to find the Factory The Factory have to be

785
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,928
Up to par and we dat's LK wire the money over here here so we're working with the

786
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
I mean all of it still

787
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
Landed on us the only area where I felt it obviously it was giving us the ability to scale is number one

788
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,192
The store's knew they were going to get their goods in time

789
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
How did you get

790
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
Entree into the big

791
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Retailers Toy

792
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
To carry your product

793
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,504
Well that really wasn't hard at that point because we had already has six or seven years full of you know really Servicing

794
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
Specialty stores really well

795
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
And

796
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:50,208
A retailer is it actually we have to we have to stop the retails we have to not allowed

797
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
To purchase

798
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Because some of the kids

799
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Some of these big retail disabled NOW Foods not cool anymore

800
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
Because it's in these big retailers

801
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
I guess like

802
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
10 years

803
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Before

804
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Boo boo sucks really take off

805
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Adidas

806
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Struck out

807
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Really famous Teen Wolf

808
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
The first time

809
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
Major company did a branding deal with

810
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
With with any music

811
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Artist

812
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
I wonder if a lot of these big box stores like

813
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Macy's or

814
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,328
Other companies that want to carry FUBU they trying to jump on that on the hip-hop and bandwagon did they see this as a

815
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
Hugely potential

816
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
Profitable Market that

817
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
They wanted it on

818
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,104
They did so they first of all late they were scared I actually did hear many stories say we don't want

819
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,480
You know a lot of those type of people in the store cuz they're going to have shootouts and or shoplift

820
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
I saw it

821
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
A large retailer did ask me to take the picture of myself and my my three other partners off the Hang tag cuz it said we look like a guy

822
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Gang

823
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
So you got to understand the ignorance of some of them

824
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,328
Were you when you're running up against.

825
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Kind of racism

826
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
And by us

827
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
People cannot judge you even before you walked

828
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
To the door

829
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Do that do that

830
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
No not at all

831
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,968
I don't know where these people I don't know it was somebody's bias or something like that I don't know what they've been exposed to in their life

832
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:21,600
If you know maybe they weren't around certain other people and maybe they just need that one person or that other person their life too

833
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,928
Coming to the life the hopefully show them the difference of people are people

834
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
I also felt bad

835
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,792
I wouldn't be here if everybody knew what I knew

836
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,632
So if they all were that smarter than they would be no place for Daymond John

837
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,544
So I can't I can't spend my life being worried about what other people think or the ignorance or the challenge

838
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,848
They may have had grown-up they may just had the wrong

839
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
The wrong family members in their life

840
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Who telling him the wrong things but

841
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,344
I know how I'm I'm listen to glass is half-full and I believe love doesn't come in a color or gender and we have a

842
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,184
With the summer beautiful people in this world that the people who don't understand that are suffering

843
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
1996

844
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
16 and you get this

845
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
This

846
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
Delia steel Samsung

847
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Within two years

848
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
Ubud

849
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
350 million dollars

850
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
And wrap you

851
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
I mean

852
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
That's insane

853
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
How do you what

854
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
What happened

855
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
I don't know what's all the fog

856
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
Sometimes

857
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
It always has rocket ship but it was having really great partners and mental is all around and

858
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,024
Being able to have these systems put in place where

859
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
We could start scaling but if you want to simplify it

860
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
You know if the men's division of what we were doing we were doing approximately say argument sake we were doing a hundred million dollars

861
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,616
By that time I 3 years what happens is after year one you get

862
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
You get a license

863
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:54,016
Comes aboard Jordache without first license and they came up when they started doing ladies clothes

864
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,648
So now we're doing a hundred say 150 million in mens they're doing a hundred million alone and ladies

865
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
Wow you start to put other licenses on

866
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
So bags

867
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Shoes

868
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Boots

869
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
Fragrance

870
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Suits

871
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Bedding

872
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
And he's one of those are doing 15 or 10 or 5 million a piece socks and things that nature and that's how this

873
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Scalability

874
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Dr350 but

875
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
You know 350 million dollars in the fashion business is great but it's it's not you no listen Under Armour doing three

876
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,600
3 billion or 12 billion you know this real numbers at that

877
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
That they're out there

878
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,488
Even though I'm extremely proud of what happened but that's how we started to scale

879
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
And who was buying

880
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Who's buying

881
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Who are custom

882
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
So many people show

883
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:48,544
In America primarily you know African-American and door people who love rap music

884
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
All colors I remember

885
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,431
You know we first NSYNC in one of our ads you know

886
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:59,807
We started getting so many calls from stores in Nebraska and Ohio like hate you know

887
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
It's not just a black thing

888
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
And then

889
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
When you start to have

890
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:10,047
Too many goods are overruns a good to then you sell it to the places such as Burlington and TJ Maxx

891
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
And those

892
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Customers coming in their price-conscious customers they're just not looking for Brandy looking for some good old drawers that good old song

893
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Socks good old jeans and they Brian and a lot of us

894
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
I see so many parents and grandparents with with myself on going I know this is Hulu until till I looked at the label I had

895
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,575
The food just has its own interpretation from various different people

896
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Okay so you have this like

897
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,999
Several years of this incredible expansion and growth

898
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
At some point

899
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
Like a dozer play stupid with everywhere

900
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
Then I guess you

901
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Something interesting

902
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Mystic way

903
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
To describe this

904
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
Use in 2003 you semi-retired

905
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
At least

906
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Place in the US was that

907
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Because boobs

908
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
Overexposed or or what

909
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
Well what we did was we we do

910
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,183
Most of the distribution of it I mean we still obviously kept by categories but we would really narrow down

911
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Apple stores just

912
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Testa products

913
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
See I was going cuz we felt it it just need to cool down and more importantly we will reduce all the logos

914
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:24,799
As we could sell because people you know they already had 10 years of food boy in their closet they already thought that

915
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:31,455
You know it may not have been for them at the moment cuz we you know it goes through Cycles you know when a hot brand last five or maybe six

916
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
6 years

917
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Maybe 7 years

918
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,319
I'm so tired of slow the brain down

919
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,415
And and were you I mean was FUBU did it seem at that point it was

920
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Kind of time to

921
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Wind it down

922
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Is it wasn't

923
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Money

924
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,447
I think it was you didn't want to force it on the consumer that's how I felt and I think that

925
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
You know if if the stores were like oh my God I have to have it

926
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Then you know we needed to find something else to give to them and just put you no fool.

927
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
I want a back burner but kind of slow down till just really adjusting the way that the divisibility of product

928
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
You suck like a cup

929
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Wheatley

930
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Total

931
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Change of

932
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Career passing

933
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
In like

934
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Blade 2000

935
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
2008's win

936
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
You became a

937
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
TD stock

938
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
I mean a lot of these other

939
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
Labels were run by

940
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
But people who work

941
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
Kind of well-known

942
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Kennedy like

943
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Like Russell Simmons

944
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
And puffy

945
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:37,759
And Jay-Z and you were, quiet I mean people didn't necessarily

946
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
No you was walking to the Brad Wright

947
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
All of a sudden

948
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
You become

949
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
A TV star by beak

950
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
A shotgun

951
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
How did that happen

952
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
Yeah so I wanted to start paying it forward and educating people on what I went through in trying to again show them

953
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:59,007
Somebody land mines were so I started writing books I read the first book called display a power and it talked about the fact that we all have the

954
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
The same engine underneath

955
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,687
I will heard but are you going to tap into what drives you and what can make you a rockstar make you proficient

956
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,295
Eminem bring you success and I I started going to

957
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
Stations like MSNBC Donny Deutsch CNBC talk about the book and Mark Burnett

958
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
You know Mark Burnett's you know crew saw me and he had show called dragons then there was already popular in Europe in

959
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
Japan coming over to America he said he wanted me to be a shark and I said

960
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,823
Yeah whatever why not let's try this understand like the show sucks doesn't matter but I'll I'll I'll go on right way

961
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
I went for an audition and they ended up using the the pilot as the first couple of

962
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
Episodes

963
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
Shark Tank and

964
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:51,487
For I know the show that I thought would never get anywhere and sucked with these few No 5 business people just talkin business all

965
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
All the time was that

966
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
Before I know you know going into I-10 theater

967
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,399
Do you ever when you're in the shower when you're in the shark

968
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Yeah that's like

969
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,519
Go back to

970
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
To you

971
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Try to pitch your company to

972
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
The Samsung Light

973
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
Think about how you felt

974
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
No

975
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,063
I don't because I remember I was so I was so unprepared

976
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,463
I don't even I give those people that walk in front of us way more respect than I kill myself when I was pitching B

977
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,607
Those people are night and day comparison to Daymond John so I value what they're doing and I do though

978
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
I I care for them because you know

979
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,519
I love to see the people up there that they put all the work in and they just need a little X

980
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Stop and so

981
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,407
I value their their guts and I value their talking to a spirit

982
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
How much of your sick

983
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
Success do you think

984
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Because of

985
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Hard-working

986
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Intelligence in

987
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
Skillet how much

988
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,327
Very hard I always contradict myself cuz I don't believe there is anything such as look up

989
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Believe it's determination

990
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
And drive

991
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Meets opportunity

992
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,495
But when I look back and I sit there and I and I

993
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
I say see who I am you don't want this National platform able to change lives

994
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Father 3

995
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
And a Pisces

996
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
I said I myself wait a minute

997
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
You know something

998
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,551
God is about to bless me at a very different ways and that's why I work so hard

999
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
How to try to pay it forward to other

1000
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
Other people

1001
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,439
Because it's got to be some kind of lucky I don't know why I was chosen

1002
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
I have no idea but a lot of it is determination dry but I think there is a bit of luck on what's going on in my life

1003
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:39,775
Daymond John founder of FUBU a new book out called Rise & Grind

1004
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:44,639
According to Business Insider Damon's grown his net worth

1005
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
2 a quarter billion dollars since those days selling T-shirts on street corners

1006
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Hollis

1007
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:58,207
And as for Shark Tank Daymond put about eight and a half million of his own.

1008
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
Dollars in the companies featured on the show

1009
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for Howie

1026
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
You built that

1027
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
The Story begins in

1028
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
South Florida where Len Testa

1029
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,151
And every year he and his family would pilot

1030
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
And go to Disney World

1031
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
And he loved it but

1032
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Like everyone else

1033
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:58,367
He hated waiting in those long lines the summer before I went

1034
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
Graduate school

1035
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,231
I took a trip to Disney World with my twin sister

1036
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
And we waited

1037
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,095
For 2 hours in line for this ride called The Great Movie Ride

1038
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,703
I was baking in the Florida Sun I thought to myself you know my God there's got to be a better way to

1039
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,591
Do this and in fact there was a better way to do this and Len was the right guy to figure it out

1040
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,407
Because he was going to graduate school to study

1041
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Computer science

1042
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:27,551
And I went to my thesis advisors and they said I want to write a computer program

1043
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
Let's solve this

1044
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
Problem

1045
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,695
And soul in decided to do his entire Master thesis on

1046
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
Basically

1047
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,535
The most efficient way to visit Disney

1048
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,631
Yeah the first paper I ever wrote was in 1997 this is 10 years before the iPhone

1049
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,471
I said you don't want that we're going to walk through a park and we're going to have these handheld devices

1050
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
Can a GPS in something's going to be feeding it the wait time

1051
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,615
The rise and it will optimize your route

1052
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:58,015
As your wallpaper algorithm that would help people breathe through Disney based

1053
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,831
Don how busy the rides were at any given moment

1054
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,391
And when the iPhone eventually came along

1055
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
Lantern debt program

1056
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
Into an app

1057
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
You tell the app

1058
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
The ride you want to ride in the show you want to see

1059
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
And the meals that you want to eat

1060
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,143
And the Apple tell you the order in which

1061
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,215
You should do those things to minimize your wait in line

1062
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
When zap first came out

1063
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
About seven years ago and since then

1064
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
He's expanded its

1065
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,871
Discover Universal Studios

1066
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,455
And that's how I accidentally stumbled across it

1067
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
When I was planning my own family

1068
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
Trip to Harry Potter World

1069
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
Okay so when

1070
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
So I have to tell you I downloaded this

1071
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
This thing and it

1072
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,719
Where the meat we would have been stuck for like

1073
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Hours

1074
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Outside of some of these right if we didn't

1075
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Follow the app if we've

1076
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
Go to Harry Potter World

1077
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
Blindly it's good to hear

1078
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,519
And is that pretty typical mean to I mean how much time can they can an average family save if they use

1079
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Use the app

1080
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
So on a busy day

1081
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
We can save you for hours in line

1082
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Pretty easily

1083
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
I think it's your app works like Waze

1084
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
It's right

1085
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,039
I'm in a situation very often where I'm driving home

1086
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,159
And then ways is like no quick make a right turn here and then I'm going to like the wind East Suburban

1087
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,279
Read and like what I noticed they're like four cars behind me

1088
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Using Waze number

1089
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
This is

1090
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,959
This is the ways of vacation now driving so what happens when everybody at the park is using your app

1091
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Does it stop

1092
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Saving you time

1093
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:26,847
Right so we have we thought about that early on and here's what we do we know

1094
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,735
When were sending people to each ride and we know how many people each ride can handle in a given hour

1095
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
What say you will send you a dumbbell with noon

1096
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,647
And we know that it takes about 3 seconds for Dumbo to handle every person in line

1097
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
Wishing you and your family of four

1098
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,719
The Dumbo

1099
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
We will add 12 seconds to the wait time

1100
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:50,655
So that the next family gets whatever the wait time was + 12 seconds and we're constantly adjusting that tried today

1101
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
By the way lens app is

1102
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,775
Brie but the company makes money by charging AC

1103
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,383
Description for all this other specialized data about when to visit the park

1104
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919

1105
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
