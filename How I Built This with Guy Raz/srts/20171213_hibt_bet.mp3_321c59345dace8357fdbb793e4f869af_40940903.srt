And he asked me Bob how much is it to take you to lunch bet and I say

That's a deal what Malone didn't know at the time if you reverse the numbers and I'll be hating about you beat

24
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976

How Bob Johnson turned a small cable channel called bet

28
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,576
Into a media Empire and from it became the first African American billionaire

29

Washington DC

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
As a young man in the early 1970s plan to focus on public policy which is

32
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
What he did for most of his early years in 1970s

33
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
Bob stumbled into a job with an obscure trade association called the national cable television assoc

34
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,880
Very very early days of cable TV and very few people understand the

35
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
All of this new force in TV

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Johnson

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
He was one of those very few people and it was while he was there when he started to dream about a black

38
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Oriented cable channel

39
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
At the ripe old age of 33

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
Quit his job to pursue what was then a big gamble

41
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
A channel would call bet

42
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
And a channel that would have been

43
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
Make Bob one of the most successful media

Your child

Illinois

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
This was in the fifties and sixties what kind of place was it in v

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Small town about a hundred miles

Chicago Illinois

61
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
It's a rural farming

62
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
Community with a little bit of Light Industry

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
A town where people

64
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
Got along very well not a lot of integration

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Neither one side of the town

66
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Where are most of the African Americans

67
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Live the other side of town what's the whites with

68
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,327
And they also came together when you got to the high school and Junior High

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
What what kind of parents were where your parents were they strict

70
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215

Uniqlo black pants

72
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
Straight if you

73
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,039
You got to have a good excuse not to go to church you had to

74
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Dressed neatly

75
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
You know you couldn't

76
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
Drake lease around the house

77
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
So that was the weather

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
What kind of student were you at school

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
I was I was a

80
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Turned out to be pretty smart and I was in

81
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,311
An advanced English class in never forget this Center said I could have been that has eleventh grade twelve grade

82
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,687
And I remember this particular pets I never get the guys name the guy was Professor answers

83
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
And one

84
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
Day in class yes

85
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Everybody how many of your going to college

86
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Well as I looked around the room

87
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
Everybody who is Ambrose in white raising hand so I said what the hell raise my hand too so I figured I could get

88
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Pass that day

89
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
After doing that I said I really got to go out find out about college if I'm going to do this

90
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
So I went down and I found out about the an application to us

91
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
University Illinois State School

92
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
And I ended up going to the University Illinois

93
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,087
I was at a social studies teacher education was my major and with the idea

94
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,439
I was going to be a teacher but you know I graduated from honors

95
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
From University Illinois

96
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,815
And at that time the state department

97
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Was looking to recruit

98
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
African Americans to go into the Diplomatic Corps

99
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,567
They would help pay your way to any School of International Affairs that would prep you for

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Ida Pharmacy

101
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
And so I did that and then apply for number schools and got accepted at the Woodrow Wilson School Princeton

102
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
International Vegas

103
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
You

104
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
You first I just came down here to get into public policy around 1972

105
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
To a thing

106
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
What do you remember about

107
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Washington DC at that

108
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,751
Well when I came down remember I came down out of Princeton so if you have a

109
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Ivy league degree

110
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
There's a

111
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
A network

112
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Ivy league graduate

113
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
And Washington

114
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
And I remember beating the lady who was the press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson and then forget it

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
He said who do you want to work for

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
I said I want to work for Kennedy

117
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Yeah I Kennedy doesn't pay you nowhere

118
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Kennedy

119
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
This was different Ted Kennedy

120
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,959
And then I said who else you like I said I like Walter Mondale

121
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,055
Is that LOL I can get you in to see my Dale so I go to see Mondale

122
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
He is off his doesn't have a job

123
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
And then he says

124
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
You know what I just know somebody who is at the

125
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Corporation for Public Broadcasting

126
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Would you be interested in that and I just

127
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Yeah game down from Princess pitcher

128
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,231
So I go down and the guys looking for a public information officer to write

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Information about the programming at the various PBS stations

130
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,935
Abby educational stations in. That was my first job as a

131
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Public information officer Air Force

132
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Corporation for Public Broadcasting

133
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
If any must have

134
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Capture the attention of people

135
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Pretty quickly because

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Within a couple years you were working

137
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
For Walter fauntroy

138
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
2

139
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Would go on to become the first

140
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
DC delegate to

141
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,671
Congress what happened

142
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,279
What happened was I didn't know anything about washing I just came down here off of

143
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Princeton

144
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
And also not working and having a good time

145
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
There's an election

146
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Didn't make a difference to me they both

147
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
Yeah I guess so I don't care about it and

148
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
So

149
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
So what I do is I found out what washing is like is when it changes

150
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Streisand some people get fired

151
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,135
And and and I started saying well gee I guess I'll look around

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
And that's how somebody I know referred me to the Delegate for the District of Columbia Walter fauntroy who is this

153
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Non-voting Congress

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
And

155
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
So I just did what you doing Washington

156
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
When Administration changes you change jobs

157
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
That's that's why I didn't that's why I ended up on that

158
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
Capitol Hill working as his press secretary

159
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Attack point in your life

160
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
If you were not thinking about

161
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,319
Becoming a business if we went back to who you were when you were looking for Walter fauntroy

162
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
You would not have guessed I guess if it's points

163
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
That you would go into business with you

164
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,071
No the only business I ever had was a paper route not failed at that so I didn't

165
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,471
But what I did learn from that and another summer job I had I didn't like working for anybody else

166
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
So if I was going to be successful

167
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,359
I probably have to one day work for myself

168
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,479
So but now but when I was working as a press secretary you meet a lot of people

169
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,343
And I was at a party I live that time over in southwest DC

170
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
So I meet this lady at

171
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
This party Angie

172
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
We get to Talkin at

173
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
She said wow you make a good lobbyist for the cable ends

174
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,375
And I said I don't know anything about cable she said don't worry I don't know anything about it when I got it

175
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
So

176
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
I got in the cable industry

177
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,543
And that gave me the one stripe I was missing so I had to put it goes Drive ahead

178
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Public affairs stipend cpb

179
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
It was the business Drive lobbying about for business

180
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
But deregulation

181
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
And out of that

182
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Kmart

183
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
Andre to the Pioneers in the cable

184
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
So you just met this

185
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
This woman at a party

186
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
And she said hey you should get

187
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Involved in the cable industry I work for this

188
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Trade Association do you want to come

189
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,423
The people who work there

190
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
When I was talking to her she understood you know that

191
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
I had some potential

192
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
To be to be a lobbyist

193
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
What what

194
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
What is the cable in

195
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Industry at that time I mean

196
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
With a lot of pee

197
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
People who understood that it was going

198
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
Disrupt Network TV or did most people kind of

199
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Just think of it is at

200
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
A niche

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Sector you know like a

202
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Flash in the pan

203
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
The

204
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
Rule of thumb was from the broadcast

205
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
Cable would erode audience

206
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,199
And harm over-the-air free broadcasting what's really translated in harm their pocket

207
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Then on top of that there was

208
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
Telephone companies to

209
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,647
Wanted to control cable lines getting on telephone

210
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Because you can't get cable to home

211
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
Unless it's strung up on a telephone pole so the cable

212
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Telephone companies in League with the broadcast

213
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
And a lot of members of Congress because

214
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
See if your a congressperson

215
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
Who do you turn to to get your story out your local broadcast

216
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,639
So they had a formidable group of opposition against cable deregulation

217
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Chicken butt

218
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
No technology is a hard thing to

219
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Keep tie down

220
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Andaz

221
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Satellite

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Launch

223
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
And you can beam signals

224
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Across the entire country

225
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
And aggregate huge audiences via cable

226
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
Overtime the argument for

227
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
More content free choice

228
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
More diversity of content particular

229
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
Who won the argument with a lookup a court case

230
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
And at the end result is you see what you have now is the zillion channels of cable and digital

231
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Continent

232
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
And broadcasters

233
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
Healthy maybe not as healthy as they used to be but still love

234
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
A formidable content provider

235
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
So this was maybe an apocryphal story

236
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
But I have read that

237
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
In 1979

238
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
You met a guy from Florida who

239
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Who is coming to DC

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
C2

241
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
To meet with Congress folks

242
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
About an idea he had you were a lobbyist

243
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
And you

244
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Came to help him what

245
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
What's that story is it true

246
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
The sky he wanted to start

247
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
A channel for the elderly

248
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Dan Silverman

249
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
So cancel

250
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,343
Said to me said I said I was your proposal he open it up and he had this they had this data

251
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,183
He said elderly people consume certain products

252
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
Elderly people have a certain income

253
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
Elderly people make up X percent of the population

254
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
I said what I said

255
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
Good data points in Georgia

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,567
Just kind of facility

257
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,199
Esl Channel off the ground I don't know why

258
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
But

259
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
I had his information so when I started bet I said

260
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Black people have certain spending patterns

261
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Black people have surgeon shopping pattern

262
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
I just where we had elderly I just filled in Black

263
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
And I just went in and took his model

264
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
And out of that game bet

265
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,287
Was that the the Genesis of the idea this guy have this idea for an elderly Channel and you're looking at in your sink

266
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
This applies to

267
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Did African Americans as well

268
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Now that was in the Genesis of it

269
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,271
That's that's too highbrow word for what I did

270
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
That was

271
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
That was pure theft

272
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,743
Genesis would be Genesis would be content

273
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,607
That was not technologically driven by satellite and cable it would be ebony

274
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
Ebony magazine

275
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
Elite assets and black Enterprise and even black radio

276
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,407
They told the story of black aspirations they gave us open to

277
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Black content and information

278
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
Black radio stations play black music

279
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
So the concept

280
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Are the Genesis if you will

281
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Target program already exists

282
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,607
Life or look could have started Ebony magazine if they wanted to they didn't want to because it was segregated or Niche Conte

283
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,239
Fortune could have started Black Enterprise they didn't want to do it because it was Mitch Conte

284
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,823
What I did was to take advantage of the

285
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Technological change that way

286
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
What brought about

287
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
By the launch of satellites

288
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Do I allow signals to be beamed across the United

289
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
State

290
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
And instead of aggregated just black households in

291
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Chicago

292
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
I get aggregate black cable households all across the

293
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
The continental United States

294
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
Cuz cuz you were looking at these media organization

295
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Continued saying

296
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
We can do this on TV

297
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,191
They have the business model they sold advertising they had readers in this case or

298
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Subscribers

299
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,287
And they made money so that model

300
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Woodwork

301
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
If you could put together content

302
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
On television

303
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
But you had the aggregate

304
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
A large enough

305
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Audience

306
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Because

307
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
You couldn't compete with a local broadcast station

308
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,135
Trying to find a chest in one city you had to have the whole country

309
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,255
So you're there working for this cable trade Association this idea starting to

310
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Kind of

311
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,143
Work its way through your head were there other people who were who were seeing the same Opera

312
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Opportunity that you saw at the same time

313
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Yeah I made it that the one that's Most Fascinating is

314
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
Is Ted Turner launching CNN

315
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
If you think about it

316
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
CBS with

317
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Walter Cronkite

318
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
The brand

319
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
As a father of news

320
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
Could have launched on cable a CBS News Network

321
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Instead of letting Ted do it

322
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
But they saw themselves

323
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
As a

324
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
30 minutes

325
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
6 p.m.

326
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Period of news

327
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
They just didn't see news as a 24-hour

328
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Audience product that would appeal to America

329
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Classic country

330
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
Ted when he was starting in the same thing with the guys with ESPN

331
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
NBC could have started ESPN if they wanted to

332
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,039
And I was talking to Ted and he was pitching the idea

333
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Two people about the

334
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
A 24-hour

335
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
News Network

336
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
It's a funny thing if you go back and read some of the clips

337
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
It's about what people saying when

338
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
When tattoos go to the 24-hour news

339
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
You find out people are laughing at me

340
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,911
So I so want a was talking about it and I say Ted

341
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
What happens

342
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
If there is a day where there's no news

343
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Ann and Ted said Bob here so we got

344
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,407
We got a group of people we're going to go out start fires

345
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
And it will cover

346
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
Will cover the fires and it will have some news

347
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,599
So that's what happened is

348
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
People missed out

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,231
On the cable Revolution this is something a business to do is

350
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Steak

351
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
And I see I was saying is that the reason

352
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
The railroad companies dinner on the airline

353
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,239
Is because the railroad companies they thought they were in the railroad business

354
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
As opposed to the passenger moving business

355
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
I mean everybody here in this room probably had one at a time

356
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Yellow

357
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Yeah analog

358
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Sony Walkman

359
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,111
I bet you are in your closet someplace you haven't thrown them out

360
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
But they didn't go digit

361
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
And they lost out to

362
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
Apple and the rest is history

363
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
But yeah I want to come back to that in just a moment but I want to ask you

364
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
How you started this emanuar

365
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
33

366
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
I'm assuming you didn't have a whole lot of your own

367
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
Money to work with I had a paycheck but that was about it and I was working at the cable industry and so I had to

368
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Believe the

369
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
My starter had to leave the cable

370
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
So

371
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
I borrowed some money from the bank

372
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
Start Gym number how much

373
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
It's probably $40,000

374
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Senior bank loan

375
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
And

376
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
That's not enough to start

377
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,351
People television network so what did you do where did you go

378
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,239
I admit I was a lobbyist obviously and I met one of the board of directors of the trailer source

379
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
Json a gentleman by the name of the doctor

380
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Did John Malone

381
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,943
And he and I became friends and one day said to me said Bob if you ever have an idea come talk to me

382
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
So when I got the idea for bet

383
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,111
I went out and talked to John and we're sitting in his office

384
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
And he asked me Bob how much does it take you to lunch

385
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Bet

386
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
And I said John about a half a million dollars

387
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
And so Malone

388
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Says to me say Bob here's what I'm going to do

389
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
I'm going to

390
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
Buy 20% of your company

391
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
480

392
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
And I'm going to loan you 320

393
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,151
18320 there's a $500,000

394
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
None of that business plan Bob

395
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
You will be 80 and I'll be 20

396
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Is that a deal

397
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
I said John that's a deal

398
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
What Malone didn't know at the time if you reverse the numbers that I'll be 80 in Bob ub-20 I said John that's a deal

399
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Now you got to keep in mind a half a million dollars

400
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Tumi

401
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Was equal to the

402
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
Total GDP of everybody black in Freeport

403
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
So

404
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
I got this

405
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
I am terrified

406
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
That's something bad to happen walk out of this building is amazing to Robbie this $500,000

407
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
Gave you $5,000

408
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
Like that with no due diligence no

409
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
Took 30 minutes for him to give me the check

410
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
Why why would he believe I mean

411
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,959
I told you I'm good I even have sex with you tonight

412
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Man with no you haven't

413
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Allen Express

414
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
I did I did a survey

415
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,479
I call I remember I got on the phone and call down to a place call Anniston Alabama

416
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
I call that barber shop in Anniston Alabama

417
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
The shop was owned by guy named

418
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Pink junior Woods

419
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,023
So I called in and I said I'd like to speak the pink junior

420
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
I think Junior got on the phone I said pink

421
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
If I brought cable

422
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,031
Down to Anniston Alabama and play Grambling football Jackson State football

423
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Would you guys cry

424
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
He said you can do that

425
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
I said yeah if you subscribe

426
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
Tomorrow is a guy on the phone said he program in football.

427
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
And they said yeah

428
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,951
So I took that back to Java latte Jana do the survey in the black community

429
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
And

430
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
People down in Anniston Alabama naisu mantises like other cities throughout this

431
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
They would subscribe

432
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
And so he said okay and he brought his lawyer yet took off 30 minutes

433
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
He wrote me this check

434
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
And so

435
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Now John gives me the check

436
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
You know

437
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
I got a side job I got to ask you a question

438
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
But I waited till I had to check first

439
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
So anyway

440
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
I want to be stupid cuz with the check first

441
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Do I say John

442
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
I never started a business before

443
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
What advice can you give me

444
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
And

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
And John bellone said Bob

446
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
Get your revenues up keep your costs down

447
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:32,032
That was my Harvard MBA and I was sick

448
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,664

From NPR

463

Gyros

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
So it's 1980

465
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Bob Johnson

466
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
Just taking that half a million dollars

467
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
John Malone

468
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Duloxetine

469
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,904
But don't get the wrong idea

470
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,256
Actually a Channel with tons of content in fact

471
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Blastoise

472
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Barely longer than this podcast

473
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,704
It was on for 2 hours on a Friday and a Saturday night

474
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
That was it on the

475
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,336
Popular cable channels update USA Network

476
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,712
As we started programming more and more we started getting more hours

477
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
On the USA Network and eventually

478
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,856
We say we got to have our own satellite and so we

479
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
Had enough Capital to acquire satellite transponder

480
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
The beam around signal so we went from

481
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,840
8 hours to 16 hours at 24 hours in and what was the

482
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
That you were

483
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
And the content was

484
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:12,800
Syndicated programming that we could buy from the studio for cheap does content original

485
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
Inexpensive we didn't do anything original

486
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
We it had to be

487
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
We called it the three ends

488
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,088
Indican in the studios are in existence

489
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
That's all it is

490
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
So a Grambling football game they don't play any way we show up or not with camera

491
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
The way you do football games because there's an existing

492
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,888
That was in the can was yo

493
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
Yeah good times and Sanford and Son

494
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
And then in studio is

495
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Youku

496
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
People like we are now

497
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
All we got to do is bring a camera you have a BT show

498
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,528
To offer content that wasn't going to be

499
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Expensive

500
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
But that could build an.

501
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,904
Yeah if it would get your revenues up to the Goffstown

502
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,256
And then when vent when MTV refused to play

503
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
Or started out not playing black music videos

504
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,472
And the Black Talent wanted to have their videos down and I went to him and say

505
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Hey if you keep making the videos

506
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
I'll keep putting them on

507
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,200
And as result of that we gained some sort of an early franchise position

508
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,784
Ensuring Urban R&B African American music video

509
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
And all of that was free

510
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Electronic it was free

511
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
Totally free

512
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Wow

513
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,488
I mean it's like it's like you think about a company today like a media company today and

514
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
You know investors want you know user-generated content

515
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,656
Making content is expensive which is why investors Love YouTube

516
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Write or read it because

517
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Nobody's paying to make that contact

518
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
If you if you

519
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Want to look

520
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
At how I became

521
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
A business genius

522
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
Is not very hard all you got to do is come up with a business

523
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Where you get free music videos

524
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,648
Cable operators pay and advertisers pay you

525
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Do you get paid twice for nothing

526
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
That's a pretty good deal you got to be real

527
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
You got to be real dumb to mess up that model

528
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
So when you started to pitch bet

529
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
To advertise

530
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
In the first for five years

531
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
What were they you know

532
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Comedy with open arms saying yes we will advertise on this

533
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:38,976
Not really early on a couple of big Brands said hey we we really reach black Auto

534
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Chances we want to be in

535
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
Pepsi-Cola was an early advocate

536
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
What's that market stay with Anheuser-Busch

537
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
They got exclusive rights

538
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,104
But what you call the real Revenue generators that the package good guys

539
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
The Procter & Gamble

540
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Colgate

541
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
In the light

542
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
They were slow to come on because they were reaching eyeballs

543
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Amazon

544
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
May all the ascendicate it shows on network television and so you could you could accumulate a lot of black eyeballs and

545
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Viewership

546
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Without

547
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,792
Paying for something that was untested on Nielsen measure

548
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Is cable

549
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
It was it was it was a tough

550
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Argument to make

551
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
But

552
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
You make the case you say look

553
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
You got to

554
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
Reach This audience they consume your product

555
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Stay work

556
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Company

557
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
You do all of the Duggars social selling

558
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
You know it's just

559
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
You come

560
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
That's a within about two inches of threatening them

561
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
You know

562
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,952
And that if you're going to do is I'm going to tell Jesse Jackson that you had advertised and stuff like that

563
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
So

564
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,584
Overtime though is cable beginning rated penetration

565
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
More more programming came about

566
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,728
Advertisers began to see the value of getting in first

567
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
An advertising on BET or MTV

568
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,992
All right so you at you you are running this company

569
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
And

570
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
You got some momentum

571
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
You become profitable and in 1991 you take the company public

572
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
It becomes the first

573
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Majority black owned

574
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Company will be listed on the New York Stock

575
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Right

576
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,912
No African-American had done it before on the stock

577
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Exchange.

578
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Who sings Been Around almost

579
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
Are going back to Bethel

580
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
Founding of the country little bit after the Revolutionary War

581
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
And nobody had done it

582
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,248
So and I had this notion that if you're going to be a visible

583
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
African American player in a pedometer

584
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
White culture business culture

585
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
You had to do something to get identified

586
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,512
And nothing could identify you more than playing at the game

587
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
You know

588
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
On a company go public

589
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,216
Be totally transparent in your ownership and everything about your company under rules

590
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
And that makes you part of the old boys club

591
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
Let me be the first one to do that

592
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
And and that's what I did and

593
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Animated

594
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,088
Up one of the things that you know of when you've dealt with

595
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
During your time

596
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
You was

597
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
It came under

598
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Criticism

599
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
I wasn't always a

600
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Embraced with

601
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
And some some African Americans

602
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Felt that

603
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
It wasn't

604
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Good represent

605
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
Rotation of

606
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
African American culture you've heard those

607
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
I was in the past

608
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
Do you did you ever feel like they were

609
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Fair criticism

610
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,480
I felt the criticisms were born out of what is

611
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,064
In the African-American Community if you think about

612
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Historically the app

613
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
African American community

614
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
It is been

615
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
A collective

616
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
Has been a collective because they've been on set

617
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
By forces

618
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Beyond their control

619
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
And they all as a result of that

620
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
They have to group together

621
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
And so when you start a business

622
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
It was the

623
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
Preconceived notion

624
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
That your business exists it

625
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,224
To further the collective the goal of African-American

626
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
And so if you were doing something

627
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
That they felt

628
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,136
Didn't do it say if you weren't doing black educational television

629
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
You were

630
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Failing in your obligation

631
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
And so we got the Brunt

632
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
Of everybody who wanted us to be

633
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Part of that

634
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
Collective

635
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
Because we were the only one

636
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
We just happened to Garner

637
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
Everybody's hopes dreams and aspirations

638
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
And then

639
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
The other part of it is in Black Culture

640
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,480
Because you have an obligation to be

641
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
I would say

642
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
More

643
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Protective

644
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Of our

645
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
You can't do anything to show our claws

646
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
So if you shows

647
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:01,120
Scantily clad women and videos and all kinds of gyrating dancing

648
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,984
And by the way I never made a video at all so don't blame me for

649
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
That was like that is not proper

650
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Depiction of our people

651
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
On the other hand MTV

652
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,576
Could do anything they could do Pimp My Ride took my sister and pimp anything you want

653
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,512
We couldn't do that we done that we would have been banished in fact the other my successor

654
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Debra Lee

655
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
She was picking it for a. Of almost 4 months outside of a house with people bullhorn

656
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,336
No taunting her because she was running BD that played music video

657
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
But Black America

658
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Has always had to live

659
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
In a contradiction because

660
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
It is

661
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Dominated by white culture

662
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Did that criticism ever

663
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Get you down with especially when you heard it for

664
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
From prominent app

665
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
African Americans did you ever feel

666
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Chat about it

667
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Were you saying what you're saying now

668
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,216
Do you think I would be here because it never got me down

669
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
Do you think

670
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,920
Do you think I'd be saying this in criticism ever got me down

671
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
No

672
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
Alright so you have this

673
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Incredibly successful

674
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Company now

675
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
A burgeoning medium

676
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Empire in 1998

677
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,816
You decide to take it private this is a public companies traded on the stock exchange

678
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,888
How did that happen and why did you decide to

679
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Buy it back

680
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,008
So do me the answer is as simple and I

681
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
Not sure why anybody would be

682
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
Baffled to ask me this question

683
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Because I figured I can make more money

684
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
But you and me the stock price was like 31

685
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
You bought it back

686
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Double that about

687
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
Now what happened was this.

688
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Was

689
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Trading at 31

690
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,816
We felt the stock was worth closer to 45 or 50

691
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
Because we're

692
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
Getting a discount on the value of ishares

693
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
Abacasa stock was family tree why was it under why was it being under belly

694
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,824
Because it was family traded I want a big chunk that I wouldn't have salad

695
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
John Malone on the beach

696
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
A lot of float in the marketplace to make the stop move up and down

697
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
So what we did was

698
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
We said

699
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Les batiks

700
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
TalkBack

701
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
And take the company

702
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Be private

703
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
And we offered 45 bucks a share which was a good premium to Stockton been trading consistently for 3 months at about 30

704
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
233 bucks a share

705
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
The next day the stock went to 6

706
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,520
Which proved that people said these guys are trying to steal the company we don't let him do it so

707
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
We ended up buying a company back at 62 bucks a share

708
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,640
And we kept it private

709
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
And then we sold it to buy a cam

710
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
For a hundred and

711
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Swiss double

712
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
626

713
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
You made 3 billion dollars

714
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
That's right

715
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
In

716
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
In 2001

717
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
You sell the company to buy comp

718
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
3 billion dollars

719
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Probably close to the p

720
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
BTS value

721
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,544
What was lucious thinking at the time did you think yourself

722
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
This thing is

723
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Can I get anymore

724
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,736
We got it we we got to cash out the multiple of Mediacom

725
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
20 times ebitda

726
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
So naturally you're looking at it

727
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Do you say how high can it go

728
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,536
Before you either one you get more competition which drives your value down

729
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
So you you look at and you say Zatanna cell plus

730
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
I had a partner John Malone had been in the company

731
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
20 years

732
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
His only exit

733
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Was the sale of the Hellenic

734
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
Do I have that obligation to him

735
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
So

736
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,944
What did that $500,000 GetJar Malone

737
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
John's

738
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
180 cup at 3:20 and the other side got Payback

739
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,856
His 180 yield him

740
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
700

741
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,720
And 70 million dollars a Viacom stock

742
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,072
And you know and you know I did pretty good too

743
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
And the time it was obviously and pack a bowl because

744
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
You couldn't do that today

745
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
I know that BT's wear for 20 x multiple today now

746
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
At that point you become the first

747
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
African American

748
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Billionaire

749
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Overnight

750
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
In US history

751
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Was that was an important milestone

752
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
For you

753
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
It wasn't a milestone in terms of me personally it was a milestone in terms of achieving some

754
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Something that would

755
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Get you

756
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
The recognition of visibility that

757
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
Would say

758
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
If African-Americans are given an opera

759
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Opportunity

760
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,408
They can prove that they can generate wealth

761
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
For themselves

762
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Their family

763
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
And it's country

764
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
That wasn't what I was trying to make

765
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:13,952
The goal was to say we can play at that level

766
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
Exactly like white Americans

767
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
If you want to change

768
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Economic

769
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Discrimination

770
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,264
An income inequality between African-Americans and

771
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
White America

772
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
Are minority Americans White America

773
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
You got to figure out a way

774
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
To provide a flow of Kappa

775
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
Into the hands

776
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,832
Of entrepreneurs and others who are

777
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Fully committed

778
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
And fully capable

779
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
Of generating and maintaining wealth

780
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,328
Sony

781
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Survive you are

782
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
How to say the least

783
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Complex

784
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
You've got a lot of people in this

785
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
Crowd cheering for you

786
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,152
When you say that I paid for 50% of

787
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,736
But you have said I'm quoting you use this is something you've said in the

788
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
She said quote

789
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,600
I don't want to be seen as a hero to younger people or a role model

790
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Books for African American youth

791
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
Do you still feel that way I mean

792
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
I said that ink and the context

793
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Stove

794
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Of this

795
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
A hero or role model for African American kids

796
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
A my opinion

797
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Starts at home

798
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,128
The mother the father and the people who live in there

799
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
And then next door neighborhood

800
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
It

801
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
It makes no sense

802
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Stupid jerk your hero

803
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Because you see him on television

804
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
More often then you see

805
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
Your neighbor or your uncle

806
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
Who's going to work everyday

807
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
Struggling to survive

808
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
That's the real hero

809
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,448
Is the guys Justin Jackson just

810
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,008
So people take that early bus

811
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,824
That's the kind of hero that they autofocus

812
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
We just have a couple of minutes before

813
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
If we have to wrap up in a while I want to

814
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
These two very important questions

815
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
M2u

816
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,952
What what did your folks and your mother

817
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
At least your mother live to see

818
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Your

819
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Incredible success

820
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
You

821
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Coming out of this work

822
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Class home

823
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
9 brothers and sisters

824
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,520
Becoming one of the most successful entrepreneurs

825
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
In American history. And also among the richest

826
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
What would they have made of that

827
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,064
That they were very regular people they didn't you know

828
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,440
My mother used to say so people would come up and say I know you're proud of your son

829
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:00,096
Until you know the line she come back when I'm proud all my children and that was that was you know

830
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:05,472
That that's that's what she would say and if you know she would

831
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Have a way of

832
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
Bringing you down I will put you in your place one final question for you Bible question that I

00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
This made with the question I asked

Everyone who comes the show

00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
How much of your success

838
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Do you ascribe to

839
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184

Intelligence and how much sugar

90%

843
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
Now that really is a thing

844
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Every entrepreneur

845
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872

Is lucky

847
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
You call it luck

848
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
I call it

849
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Grace of God

850
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
That's what I call

851
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
There is no way

852
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Path that I took

853
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Could have happened without that

854
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Kind of

855
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Guy

856
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704

If there were things Way Beyond My Control it just simple as this

859
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640

860
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
RCA said

Did the guys at RCA then call me up and say Bobby ready we're going to launch it

You know it just happened I happened to be in the right place
