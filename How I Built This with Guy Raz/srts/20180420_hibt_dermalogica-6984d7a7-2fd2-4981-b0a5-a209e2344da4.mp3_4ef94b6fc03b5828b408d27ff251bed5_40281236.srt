To the story about Jane wurwand

67
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Really begins

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
About a month before she turned

69
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
3

70
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Because that month

71
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Her father passed

72
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Jane

73
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Barely remember

74
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
What she does remember

75
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
All of a sudden

76
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Her mom had to

77
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Get a job

78
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
There were four girls in the family

00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Two feed in

80
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
She now had to do it all on her own

81
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
This was Scotland in the 19

82
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
50s

83
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
James Bond

84
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
Happens to have a skill she was a qualified nurse

85
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
So even though she had

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
Worked for many many years

87
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
She was able to fly

88
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Find a job

89
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
And also

90
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Pass along an important lesson

91
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456

00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016

94
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Listen myself learn how to do

95
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Learn how to do something

96
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,976
She was absolutely adamant that we each of us had to get a skill-set training

97
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,816
Set no matter what happen if we were somewhere anywhere in the world

98
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
We would have a skill set in our hands

99
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
The we could go to a

100
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
Immediately and earn money and keep food on the table

101
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
So when she was old enough

102
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
Jane wurwand decided on her skill

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
We become what we

104
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Was called at the time

105
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456

106
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016

And they were based in Los Angeles and within a few months that she got offered a training trip to Los Angeles

190
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
Until I met him when I came on that business trip and

191
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Together we just said

192
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
We've got to do something

193
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
This is such an amazing country in

194
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Such an amazing opportunity

195
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
I went back he's in my notice

196
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
I tried an immigration attorney and LAN

197
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
4 months later

198
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
I was on a flight

199
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
To Los Angeles

200
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Secret telling this is like

201
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
Yeah it was January 1983

202
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
I was 24 and never been so excited in my life

203
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
Londi's in Los Angeles with a suitcase in one hand

204
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
And my beauty school diploma rolled up in tucked inside

205
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Honda

206
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
Had no idea that there was an unemployment rate

207
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
10.4 pen in California

208
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
Point is it good not to know these things right I'm so my boyfriend to be looking for

209
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Schedule for 6 months

210
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Couldn't find any

211
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
Living in a one-bedroom apartment in Marina del Rey ready to take anything

212
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
And I'm a Londoner sdorica

213
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
I'm going to get Joven Hispano

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,175
So I'm going to stop cooling my trusty Yellow Pages

215
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,527
And the first thing that struck me was so hardly any advertisements

216
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Skin care

217
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
They were mostly just like

218
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Paris

219
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,303
Anyways then I quickly realized the ones I could find it was literally a handful

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Roland Beverly Hills

221
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
I'm a very sort of

222
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Elitist

223
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
Expensive

224
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Sword of offering

225
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,871
So I went and interviewed at water-cooled go to job interview went to in

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
I want to go there

227
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
The people at the front desk will America

228
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
And yet

229
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,367
The people I was seeing in the white uniforms who were offering skin care treatments while we're paying

230
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
So when I have my interview

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
There's Johnny

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
Questions I do question why I just noticed all the people are American on the front desk and all the people in the treatment room

233
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
European

234
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
And the woman who owns

235
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Who's French

236
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Said to me was

237
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
It's really simple The Americans

238
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Have horrible training they don't know how to get a

239
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Skin treatment

240
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
And the Europeans call sound

241
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
So high in carbohydrates

242
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,343
I want away from the interviews and can't repeating what she just said to me in my head on my phone

243
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,207
I think we've just spotted the greatest opportunity in this industry

244
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Straight and that is

245
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Train America

246
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
How to do a task entry

247
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Treatments

248
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Ines

249
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
Combining with that retailing and 7

250
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
I'm surprised it's like skincare wasn't a big thing

251
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,615
Is in the us at the time what what was the normal skin care

252
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
Very limited because it was old

253
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Big head big shoulders

254
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Pods Dallas it was all makeup

255
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,135
I mean you can pick up magazines then VOC all this designer fashion magazine

256
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Always articles on makeup

257
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
It was nothing

258
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
The dermatologist

259
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,839
How old saying oh you can use anything you need soap for multi

260
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Remind you

261
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
But not only

262
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Did the correct putter

263
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
What's what how can you go to result in this

264
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Mourned

265
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,383
When you receive a treatment in a salon it's about human Connection in human time

266
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Spiga happening in every salon

267
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Then just the service receiving soap

268
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
I was absolutely convinced

269
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
There was a waiting audience

270
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
For the next

271
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Iran

272
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Instinct

273
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
So at that point

274
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
Like what are you do

275
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
I went back start with Raymond my partner

276
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,263
And he was her husband married and we was do we would just dating living together

277
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,847
So he was having the same experience because I'll be enough

278
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
The only job he'd managed to

279
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Secure was

280
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Selling skincare quiz

281
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
4 Japanese

282
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Commission only

283
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
And we both come from the industry by spinning

284
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
So he can sell one piece of this Japanese

285
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
Equipment which was amazing

286
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
Equipment to do what

287
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
To do skincare to do steaming a foliation and it was brand new cutting-edge and he wasn't selling a p

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Door-to-door to Salon de salon

289
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Yeah

290
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
Until they were saying we are even understand what it is you selling

291
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
So we were having this

292
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
Epiphany to put it together because he was at how come they don't understand what I'm sending when this is

293
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
Absolutely sounded in Europe and the rest of the world and we sat down

294
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
And said

295
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
The opportunity is

296
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Cute

297
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
We can teach

298
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
How to do correct skin care treatments

299
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
End

300
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
We can sell this equipment to the people that were teaching

301
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,935
Right then and there you decide to start building a plan to

302
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Create a business

303
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,103
Yeah we actually cooked at up together on a drive back from San Diego to cos to nakul 2 hours

304
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
Nanette driveway completely to through a business

305
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
Rego Park can we wrote to Allen the kitchen table

306
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
On5

307
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Pages of yellow legal pad

308
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
And the plant and the plan was fine was

309
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
To train the

310
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Professional

311
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Skin Therapy

312
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Then cold

313
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
An esthetician

314
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
Are we going to take everyone who has lice

315
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
We were going to Bridget to the two-year training that we felt would bring them up to 11

316
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Efficiency where they could be

317
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Successful

318
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
The goal was really simple we're going to make

319
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Skin therapist

320
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
More success

321
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Unable to run their own business

322
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
And be financially independent

323
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
Spaghetti was that you guys would open up a school and yeah

324
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,703
Ravens going to still sell equipment he was going to stay on the road I was going to teach

325
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
I was going to use the equipment he was selling in the closet I was teaching

326
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Sell the equipment off to the claw

327
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,711
Are we cooled at the international dermal Institute

328
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Had you even have

329
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,623
Cash to start at the open up at

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
It was a helluva difficult together leaves

331
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
Cuz remember we were immigrants with no credit right

332
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
With no Bank references with nothing

333
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,423
So the only space we could find was an empty space that been empty for years

334
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Next to the social

335
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Security office

336
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
The Marina del Rey

337
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
And they found it very difficult to lease

338
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,199
This is like long lines of people waiting for the checks every day exactly

339
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
Sitting you know people waiting to assist countries

340
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
So we rented it

341
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
And then we got the equipment from the Japanese money

342
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
TripAdvisor

343
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,975
Then We're Off to the Races and now the challenge walls

344
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Who will be going to train because we didn't know any better

345
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Siglap

346
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
People have to know

347
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Like who you are

348
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311

I wanted to develop

513
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
An exfoliant that would be really really

514
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Efficient and not cause irritation to the

00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375

Re-named the line.

522
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
We had the international dermal

523
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
Attitude so it's kind of fitting with that

524
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,295
And we wanted to know which line with a bridge between a pharmaceutical

525
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063

Contacted the raw material supplier in New Jersey often do you have any come smell like that using you material

557
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
And they gave us a list

558
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
And we started calling release

559
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Honda out of the 70 names we had

560
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
5 would take a call

561
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,848
And of the five there was one that

562
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
Number one was willing to work with us the number to we felt

563
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Could do it and this

564
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Book houses in LA

565
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
Yeah he was in LA he's since passed away but he was in Los Angeles and

566
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
We couldn't pay him that was this

567
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,720
So we figured out Raymond figured out this amazing kind of

568
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
Way of paying him based on

569
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
The first two years

570
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
Manufactured products what percentage of

571
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,312
The product that we manufacture not a percentage of sales because

572
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
We wanted to make sure he was tied into the

573
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,432
The fact that we would actually able to ever make this

574
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Not even going to get paid

575
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
He agreed

576
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
And and what did you decide to make what

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,976
Was a one product or two products 427 product

578
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
Because we needed to go in with a.

579
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
If we went in with one or two products

580
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
We couldn't

581
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Capture

582
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Skin therapist

583
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,800
Attention and say you need to use this exclusivity in your room and you need to sell this

584
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Plies it would have been enough

585
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Tula creams

586
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,944
3 cleanses to moisturizers

587
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Three boosters

588
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Two moths

589
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Annoying makeup remover

590
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
And then we had

591
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
819 products that work

592
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Professional only peels

593
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,816
Unprofessional mosques and things that would only be used in the treatment room

594
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
He was making

595
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Office Pride

596
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
Yeah he was like Rumpelstiltskin is formulating them all you were going and testing them out a little bit or not

597
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
I briefed him

598
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,128
He came back 2 days later with a little cardboard box is sample size

599
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Capacity of May

600
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
Any copyright I mean that's going to save on him both elephant

601
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
But they were both great

602
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
I mean an end

603
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
In 9 months

604
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,952
We had developed 27 formulas

605
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
And we named them in one afternoon

606
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,096
How are you like even funding that

607
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
You think about that today

608
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Hundreds of thousands of dollars

609
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
Test it and just to get it into the tubes

610
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
We were buying tubes that nobody wanted we were buying 500 at a time that they were selling to us Vino

611
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Feeling them yourselves

612
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,672
No but we went to a contract manufacturing Los angeles-- the Trees of the fellow nosodes

613
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
And told him I'll dream gave in the pitch

614
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,840
And said we need you to do like a test run for us

615
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
We can pay you like

616
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
$500

617
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
And his minimum monthly thousand

618
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,336
Without him we really wouldn't have to come because he looked to us

619
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
After we've been sort of like pitching

620
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Breezily for an hour

621
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,504
He's absolutely no reason

622
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
To do that

623
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Because

624
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
99

625
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Sign of everyone that sits opposite me telling me this story does not say

626
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
But for some crazy reason

627
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
I think you've got something interesting and I want to be in for the ride

628
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
By the way had you how are you able to test them

629
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
The product I tested every

630
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Everything approved every

631
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
And yourself

632
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
You are like your own

633
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
I was my own guinea pig and then

634
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
I took it to class

635
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
I like week the students like to ask them what they sow

636
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
I love that

637
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
And they were using it in the closet

638
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
It's just out of curiosity what does that have

639
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
How to go through like

640
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
Any kind of regulatory

641
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,512
Commissioned writing

642
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
Either we were very young

643
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Company in

644
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
A lot of the rules I suppose we weren't even aware of

645
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,336
But Tom at the time and still we weren't using any ingredient

646
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
We would eliminated a lot of the irritate

647
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Radiance

648
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm so in the 9-month

649
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
That we were testing the product

650
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Cuz we would develop

651
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
That we hadn't

652
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Had any incidents

653
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Reaction

654
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Benzo allergies

655
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
Cancel that was a thing you just like

656
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
You just launched

657
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Yeah

658
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
We launched in January of 1980

659
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
86

660
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
And the crazy thing was

661
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
The chemist to develop these formulas who we were

662
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Going to pay off over to you.

663
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Came to us in December

664
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
585 4 month

665
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Before we would do to you

666
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
And said that he did not believe

667
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,016
In the product he didn't believe we could be success

668
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
For any new venture

669
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
What why did he say

670
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
Because he just seen so many stars have

671
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Fail this is the visitor chemist

672
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
That's enough

673
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
This is the guy that you like

674
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
This is Rumplestiltskin he just said I don't think is going to work

675
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Yeah I don't think it's kind of what I'd like you to pay me out for the

676
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
The formulas

677
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Now

678
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
And we didn't have any money to buy the forest

679
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,104
Is it going to cost you I mean that he wanted something extraordinary and we whistle them down it came down to

680
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,712
You know Soda $14,000 probably was a lot of money for you and I

681
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
10 million

682
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Why did the chemist not thing

683
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
It would work

684
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
How to get to believe enough

685
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,720
Using the formula I think he's only for two immigrants

686
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
These crazy immigrants

687
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
How did I know about starting a company

688
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
What do they know about

689
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Funding a

690
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Company contact

691
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
Don't stink

692
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Company were you freaking out

693
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,592
Yes we were freaking out but we had to figure this out scramble put it together so

694
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
We

695
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,992
Borrowed money for family we put together everything we could from the school we put it together when we paid

696
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,856
Aren't you so nervous like if this is the key I sing to you this is not going to work

697
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:15,488
And you're likely better come up with a 14000 but we're going to be kind of screwed because this guy

698
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
We were worried that formulas he was giving us

699
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,424
Literally be exchanged on the table of a Coco's Diner

700
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,520
Que pasa manila envelope of formulas however we passed the money out of

701
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
And

702
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,408
We were worried that the phone is he giving us for not formulas that we approve but

703
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
We actually had

704
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
The guy who was going to manufacture the product

705
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
Look at formulas for us and he's another

706
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
This isn't that right

707
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
This the real deal

708
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
Just thinking about that that moment where a guy who was

709
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Total expert

710
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
Same to you

711
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Who's never manufactured

712
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Skin care products

713
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
That

714
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
This isn't a work and yet you have to come up with

715
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
$14,000

716
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Pay him

717
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
Did you have any doubt

718
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
No

719
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
You didn't think you didn't Maybe

720
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,896
No she couldn't be right wasn't possible because if he was right

721
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,784
We are about to launch into the biggest disaster of all life that may have been

722
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
The case may have a week to each other one with self repeated enthusiasm

723
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Yuan Ray

724
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,512
Like you were a world like this is going to work

725
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,584
Isn't it I need one of us is having a modicum of doubt

726
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Guarantee the other woman having a good day so on the days when I might be saying

727
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:32,288
We not crazy right rabies

728
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,616
This is going to be great and on the days when he was saying

729
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
I think it's a house

730
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Cause maybe it'll going to collapse I'd be saying

731
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
I just closed it was so fantastic

732
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Everybody's

733
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
619

734
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
This is going to work

735
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
You know what if it doesn't work

736
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,512
It's not the greatest disaster in the world we have nothing to lose by

737
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
And it was

738
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
What if it works

739
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
And we did the classic immigrant thing way

740
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Uganda population

741
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
1% of the population

742
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
And to buy one product

743
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
How do you spell ready

744
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Enormous bigger than it could ever be in the UK

745
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
So let's go for

746
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Okay so

747
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,552
You had no investors and and you basically figured

748
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Will sell the product that will fund the

749
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
Manufacturer of more of the product exactly

750
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
And most of your customers were who

751
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
My student

752
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,584
The first account be opened with in baking

753
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Pittsfield California

754
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,216
And she was one of your students who had a salon there or

755
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
Becky Sinclair

756
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
She won't talk with the check and I said Becky I haven't even shown you the Prada

757
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
Then she said Jane if you and Raymond are in

758
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
I'm into

759
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,760
Am I said you are first account in the world

760
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,648
And that was at my student came out they came up with so we want and we want to be positive that

761
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
This was a California made skin care products

762
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
We were going to Take On The World

763
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
And you are not selling this in storage right

764
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Who's only

765
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
Do you have to have a skin tag

766
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Next episode

767
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,496
And why was that why wouldn't you just like sell it in Walgreen

768
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
No no because

769
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,664
Because I'm asking therapist we knew that this was an educated so it had to be people understood the

770
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Skin

771
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,480
I don't sell these for the people that brought us

772
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
To the party

773
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,112
I my mom another piece of advice she gave me was you leave the party with the person you went with

774
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
We went with committee to

775
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
The Skin Therapy

776
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Headed Dermalogica do

777
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
That first year

778
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Did $1000000

779
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
That's insane

780
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
It was

781
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
So

782
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Insane

783
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
You must you must have at that point

784
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Like I had all these buyers who wanted to

785
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
To buy you out

786
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,224
And those people want you to lend us money and you didn't take any of it

787
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Sales word

788
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Funding the business

789
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Yeah it was so excited

790
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
It was great I mean

791
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
That first year we were planning everything back into the business unit. We hide ourselves. We wanted people walking

792
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
Dermalogica

793
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,584
And so we will putting everything back into building the base

794
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
But how are you like

795
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656

An organization

We were working all tails up Victoria Day

802
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
I didn't hire another teacher until 1980

803
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432

At 5

824
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm doing this thing that we never

825
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
New way to get rich

826
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
Last year

827
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Lowry

828
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
No

829
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
We knew we had a tiger by the

830
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
The tile.

831
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
And we

832
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
New

833
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
That we had to

834
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
To spread

835
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,616
Hotels International we need eggs in Old basket so that

836
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Is there was a recession in one place it wasn't going to take a business

837
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
And the international terminal

838
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
The Chew is now the number one provider

839
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,696
Advanced education in the industry worldwide we train a hundred thousand skin therapist every single yeah

840
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
And last year

841
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,840
A wholesale turnover was a little north of 250 million dollars

842
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
So you guys were

843
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
You basically

844
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
We ran the company

845
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Promise 30 years

846
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
Yeah and

847
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
Decided to sell it

848
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Last year sold

849
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,408
Unilever why did you decide to do that

850
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Yeah we from the come

851
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
As what I

852
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
So they say was you never beneficial.

853
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Dictatorship

854
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
We've always had a great team

855
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
We still have

856
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
But the decisions ultimately came down

857
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Dongzhimen to myself

858
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,328
Product approval Advertiser everything the brand ID

859
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
And you know we realized

860
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,984
Much that we hate to think about it the death rate is holding steady a hundred

861
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Ascenso

862
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
Ultimately we were going to have to make a plan

863
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
Of what we wanted to do with the company we have to do.

864
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Does the 17 and twin

865
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,320
And neither of them wanted to come into the business and we didn't want them to we told them

866
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,184
Even what kind of before they were born we decided we have five children and not coming into Dermalogica

867
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
It's our dream and we believe it

868
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
It's a burden

869
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,328
Two kind of shoulder your children with that

870
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Responsibility

871
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
And so we

872
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
Decided will hire a CEO

873
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
Are we going through a couple of CEOs

874
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,360
In the eight years before we decided to sell it we just wasn't working

875
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
When we realized

876
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
The problem probably wasn't the CEOs of problem was fully off

877
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Because

878
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
We are the founders you don't we have this live

879
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Passionate about

880
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
The ownership

881
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:11,232
And it's very hard to run a company when the founders room place kind of want to

882
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
I've lost what

883
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,608
I'm so we decided we should at least explore the idea of an ox

884
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,008
We've never taken a phone call from anyone that was interested in buying never even taking a cool cuz we said we don't even have

885
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
It's a distraction

886
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,616
Until we we could have lined up

887
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
Who we thought would be

888
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
The right partners

889
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
And then we we set about

890
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Deciding which ones we wanted

891
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Cool.

892
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
And Unilever

893
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
With very aligned with us

894
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
On that

895
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
Sustainable living plan

896
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
The very long with us on the volume

897
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
I'm so we decided to go forward

898
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
And I have to

899
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
With one year in and it's been a fantastic

900
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,264
The Kia summer so that Raymond and I kept

901
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
Smok centage of the company was still involved

902
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,968
It and that chemists the one who like bailed a month before The Logical launched he ever come back to you guys

903
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
And apologize

904
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
No never

905
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,136
He never did know he was like Rumpelstiltskin that flew out the window and never came by

906
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
It means amazing like looking back at your story

907
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
Because your mom was a widow with

908
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
For girls

909
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,912
And the cheetah racing around it

910
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
A little worried when you left

911
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
England for South Africa and the

912
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
The US

913
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
A little

914
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
What did she make of your

915
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Of your success

916
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:37,760
I know I know that she was really proud she felt validated in the direction that she pushed us

917
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,832
She passed away in 2001

918
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
But she's so awesome

919
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Success

920
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,976
And the lost of months of my mom's life s*** out

921
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
What time is

922
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
I'm not sure she remembered

923
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Anything about gemologica

924
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,424

Petaling

926

I was giving her money

927
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
I was right back to filing her nails and

00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
Painting lemon

929
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592

930
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
And she

931
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,944
I looked across that the woman who was in the chair next to her

932
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,552
And she said to her with a huge liquor price she said to

933
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,368
My daughter is a qualified manicurist you know

963
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,312
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

964
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,896
And today we're going to update the story we ran about

965
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
A year ago this one comes from Winfield Pennsylvania my name is Nicholas Gilson

966
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,136
And I am one of the original founders of Gilson snowboards

967
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,768
Nick and his business partners fell into the snowboard business they were Middle School teachers in Nashville in

968
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
Data science project with a challenge their students to build a

969
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,752
Better snowboard I brought in the original prototype for an idea I had when I was my student age when I was

970
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
Middle School

971
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,920
Was basically to design a board which instead of being flat at the bottom

972
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,272
And they hope that it would make for a faster ride

973
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
And even though their first design totally failed

974
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
Eventually came up with one they love

975
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976
With this board you can actually ride close to flat

976
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
And engage is really surfy drifty

977
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,192
Maneuvers that allow you to get through the trees way easier with way more surfing motion with barely any money

978
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Nick and his partner

979
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Switzer teaching jobs

980
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
And set up a snowboard shop

981
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Inside

982
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
Stable in Pennsylvania

983
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
Who's inactive stable it was an active do they were donkeys and horses next time machine

984
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,808
Mike says they were able to make their boards

985
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Even better

986
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
And we then started to travel the country starting a company much the way our grandparents would have we need to tangibly

987
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Didn't physically share something with people

988
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,144
And so we went out and immerse ourselves in the community travel 17000 miles from coast to coast

989
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
And I started getting these people on the boards

990
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
The last spoke to Nick

991
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,592
His team has traveled 17000 more miles

992
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
The slopes and

993
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
Parks across the country

994
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
Letting people sample Gilson snowboards for free

995
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
The company is now

996
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
4 years old

997
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
