00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Hey everyone just

Hope you enjoy it

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
When I walked into Ross Perot xoffice I felt like I was at

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Like I had tried everything I had tried to access everyone and I knew either

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
He supports this or I just really don't know where else to turn so I I literally told myself

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
I won't leave his office I'm going to glue myself to the chair in his office and I'm not going to

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Until he commits

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
From NPR

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
How I built this

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
Show about innovators entrepreneurs

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Idealist

00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Stories behind the movements

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Convince graduates

15
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Some of the top universities

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
To forget Wall Street

17
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Forget Law School

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Forget big money

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Become a teacher

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Sotomayor

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Different from

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
Other episodes

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
For starters you will not discover

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Because she didn't

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,152
Money was never the point

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Wendy's

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Still a really successful Builder

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,064
You can say what are the most successful non-profit Founders Andresen

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
X

30
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
Our story is

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Textbook case study

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
For how to start a business

33
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Probably why there's an

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
Actual case study about her

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
At Harvard Business School

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
Because Wendy built teacher America

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
From an idea in her head

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,032
Operation with a budget in the hundreds of millions of dollars

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,848
It's a program that sends thousands of

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
College

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
December the most neglected Public Schools

42
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
Across the US

43
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Each and every year

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,344
TFA isn't without its critics and you hear about that

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
But is also a program that's

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Change lives

47
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
And schools

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,768
Wendy during her time as a student

49
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Princeton

50
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,888
Even though she didn't really have any experience working with underserved students

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,448
In fact Corona bringing in Dallas

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Was practically

53
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Another world

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
And honestly I grew up

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
In a community in Dallas Texas that

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
Referred to itself as the bubble

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,552
You know it's kind of lack of diversity and disadvantage me my parents had

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Really made it a point to

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Bias

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,256
Place in this community so that we could go to the unit, notably strong public schools there

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
And

62
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,632
Somehow I managed to grow up really without understanding

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
The extreme disparity

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
Praising our country and

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,592
The fact that where you're born really does so much to determine whether you have access to an excellent education

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
And I

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,224
You can never become aware of that really in its full extent at Princeton but

68
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,320
On NE campus and inferencing included you can see

69
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
You know evidence of that that

70
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
Reminder freshman year roommate had gone to public schools in in the Bronx

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
And

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,328
We honestly love the most driven brilliant people

73
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
To make it to Princeton but still threw her and and threw her friends made from work kind of other first-generation college

74
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Into Princeton

75
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
I realized how differently prepared they were to do well so

76
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
Many things that turn me on to

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Viscous

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Fact that our country that

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,088
Claims to be in really aspires to be a place of equal opportunity really isn't one

80
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
And what are you

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Just thinking about this tougher or did you

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Did you start to do something

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Well

84
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Actually I had organized the conference alongside some other

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Students

86
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Princeton about

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Improving our education system

88
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
And it was at that conference where we had

89
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
Pulled together students from all of it

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
The country and they were some of the

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Most

92
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
Incredible student leaders and they were saying

93
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
We had no idea there was a need

94
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
For teachers in in urban and rural areas we would teach

95
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
And it was really sitting there that I thought of this idea like

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
Why aren't we channel in his pee

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
People energy and

98
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
And

99
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
What struck me was this idea that we would

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
Essentially build a movement among

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,447
The rising generation of leaders

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
To channel their energy

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
The teach in urban and rural Public Schools

104
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Knowing that that would have really important immediate impact in in classrooms and schools and in the life kids

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,343
So I became obsessed in the minute I thought of it I just thought this would change our country

106
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,695
Can we change the consciousness of our country and it became the answer to everything

107
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
I need to propose in my senior thesis

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
So you decided

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Turn this idea into

110
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Is your thesis your like your research project

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,727
Yeah I mean I do know I looked at different things I looked at

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Other models again

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Looked at the Peace Corps and

114
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
There was a federal teacher Corps in the six

115
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
And this time and I really went back

116
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
I analyze the policy

117
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,623
Context do you know what this actually work could we get these folks into classrooms

118
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,999
And also the mood on college campuses having it all the factors and ended up in this thesis

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Proposing the creation

120
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Andava national team

121
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Heater core ideas

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
That

123
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
They were all of these

124
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Talented

125
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
College graduates every year who

126
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Or willing and and could

127
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Contribute

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Set a few years to teaching kids in

129
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
Chicken in low-income areas I mean that that resources

130
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Being underutilized

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
I mean I felt like

132
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
You don't when I was

133
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
Thinking about my own self and all of my

134
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
Piers at Princeton you know

135
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Since we're really searching for

136
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,399
What do we want to do and not a whole lot of people knew exactly what they wanted to do so they were

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Doing was in

138
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Front of them

139
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
The time is late 80s so

140
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
All the recruiters were

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
Literally investment Banks management consulting firms

142
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Send a couple of brand manager

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Friends

144
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
I was at Princeton liberal arts majors at Princeton I mean those for the

145
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Companies that were banging down our doors

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
And so

147
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,951
My thought was you know how different would it be in our country if we had many of the most

148
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Promising

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Future Leaders instead of

150
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
And working in Worcester

151
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
For two years right out of college teaching for 2 years in

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
Urban and rural areas

153
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
And how was the

154
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
Desus receive like when you are advisor

155
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
I called you in to give you feedback what they say

156
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Well

157
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,455
He called me in and said can you come into my office and I was thinking hoops

158
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
I guess this didn't go over

159
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
But he loved it you know he did he said

160
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
About this

161
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Brilliant

162
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Wow so he was like let's let's make this happen for real

163
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,119
In the last week of writing a thesis I decided I'm just going to say in the thesis that I'm going to go do this

164
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
He liked the idea but he thought it was really crazy to think that I was really going to try to go do this so I had this plan

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,127
And one of the things I had looked at the origin of the

166
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
Peace Corps and there's this incredible paper and

167
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
The paper was this beautiful analysis that

168
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
Concluded that it had to start with 500

169
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,207
Core members that that was the smallest possible number that would seem nationally

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Important

171
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,839
But that it was a workable number anything bigger would be unmanageable so that became my number

172
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Like okay we've got to recruit

173
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
500 people saw the whole plan was to inspire

174
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,335
Thousands of people to apply in the first year unselecting training place no fewer than five hundred of them in

175
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,151
You know five or six communities across the country

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,015
And I had a budget saying this was going to cost two and a half million dollars in the first year

177
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
And my thesis advisor became really obsessed with that number like how are you going to raise 2 and 1/2 million dollars

178
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
He said you know do you know how hard it is to raise $2,500

179
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
And he sent me down he said I'll tell you what I'm going to link you up with the head of development Princeton is going to explain

180
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,543
How hard it is to raise $2,500 and this is 1989

181
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Yeah

182
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,175
And so tilted that happened that you'd sit down with the help of development

183
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
You said hey I've got this idea

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Una Familia box

185
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Yes

186
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
He was very nice

187
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
He he did explain how hard it would be

188
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
But meanwhile

189
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
I had take

190
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
Look back at this and I too wonder

191
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
What

192
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Possessed me

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Blessed with the advantage of

194
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
You don't know you have at 8

195
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
And I was

196
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Really obsessed with

197
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
Society I mean I just thought an end really it was an idea whose time has come

198
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Tom I mean I would

199
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,759
Tell people this idea and they would just a dozen this already exists in fact they spent most of

200
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
The thesis writing just looking for I wish you

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,415
Vince someone must be trying to start this because there really was a mood on College

202
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
People really were searching for something

203
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
That would enable them to make a real difference

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
And

205
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,887
You don't the fall of my freshman year of my senior year

206
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
There was a front-page article in Fortune Magazine

207
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Saying Corporate America takes on edge

208
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Education reform

209
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
And so I

210
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
I thought

211
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
These people will fund this

212
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
So I wrote letters

213
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
To everyone quoted in the article

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
And a few others by the way I would pick out

215
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,879
Like you know Delta Airlines and write to the CEO of unless you know the advantage of an expiry

216
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
The believe it or not I got

217
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
7 meanings of those letter

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,303
It's not with the CEOs but with people who they would pass the letters down to and

219
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,887
One was the head of the Business Roundtable

220
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Who is the CEO of Union Carbide

221
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,055
And you know the Business Roundtable was the group that it said we're going to take on education reform

222
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
And they had no plan

223
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
So

224
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
You know

225
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
I think my timing was just perfect and he said I'll tell you what I'll

226
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
But you use our office in Manhattan

227
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
And I'll introduce you to some other folks

228
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
And I met another executive at mobile

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Who was just

230
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
I love the idea

231
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
And said you know

232
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
What do you need

233
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
To try to make it work

234
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
I said I need a $26,000

235
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
Developed a budget saying that's what I needed to do to you don't need it

236
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
Spend three months like flying all over the country and really trying to put it together

237
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,871
And he said okay I'll tell you what I'll do it if you can get Princeton to be the conduit

238
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Funds

239
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,247
So I called the head of development and literally I mean this is amazing I now realize but

240
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,135
In two hours he got the president to sign off on being the conduit of funds what was the condo Define

241
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
What does that mean like they could write the check

242
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
The Princeton

243
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
And then Princeton would just give it to

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Even though we didn't have our tax exempt

245
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Stop

246
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Hawaii

247
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Was that important to him

248
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Well

249
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
Have no credibility in and you can't give him another Foundation you can't give

250
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Funds to an individual like me

251
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
So young other ngos can

252
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Can figure out how to be a conduit to Startup

253
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Spec

254
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
You know you have to jump through hoops to be able to

255
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Do that so you got person to agree to

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Listen to launder this money to help

257
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Help you launch Teach for America

258
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Right off the bat you thought I've got to just go to

259
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
The corporation

260
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
To get funding for

261
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Well I had to find

262
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
Yeah I had to find some funding before I graduate it's what I had to

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Something to live on

264
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
And that was my biggest thing was her you know that was very stressful day April

265
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
I'm thinking I've got two months to get some money

266
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
You know a lot of

267
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
A lot of students right

268
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
College

269
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,135
Reese's right like mine was on gladstonian liberalism that was a last time

270
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
I

271
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,999
Expose myself to gladstonian liberalism two decades ago

272
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
But you can we are

273
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
You know

274
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Your thesis is been your life's work

275
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
What do you think it was that compel you to

276
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
This idea did you go out and graduate and say I'm going to pursue this

277
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
What is a relay

278
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Is good idea right like one of those ideas

279
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
Is that if I hadn't

280
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Pursued it

281
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Someone would have figured it out in the in the

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Couple years after I'm really cool

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,791
Commence to that I mean it's just one of those ideas it's so foundational with so many other things

284
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
You know somehow I just landed on

285
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
On a good idea

286
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Okay so you got

287
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
$26,000 in NC money

288
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
And then

289
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
You got this office space in the Business Roundtable

290
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
And are you guys at this point already calling yourselves

291
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Teach for America

292
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Well we we had named ourselves

293
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
America and then we found out that that was

294
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Name of a medical supply company so we played.

295
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,183
3 months trying to think of an alternative until one night at midnight

296
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
Subway I just bought for

297
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Teach for America

298
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
Thank heaven

299
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
Great cuz Teach for America is such a better name

300
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,983
You keep saying we so I'm assuming that you and Emma I guess a couple of friends

301
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Guy came up with it

302
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
With a plan to launch this thing

303
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Yes well our plan was

304
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Let's

305
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Show people

306
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
So I mean that was

307
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Pretty much

308
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Cuz we were hearing

309
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
No one was going to do anything the school districts were telling us if you get these people from these colleges we had a list of 100 College

310
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
And they would look at the list I would remember meeting the head of Human Resources in Los Angeles and I mean it had its legs kick back

311
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,167
Back on the desk and he started laughing when he looked at the list of a hundred

312
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Intelligence

313
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Okay I'll tell you what

314
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,847
You get 500 people from these colleges to want to teach in my schools and I'll hire all five

315
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Is the LA Unified School District

316
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
So you went

317
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
To meet with

318
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
Seattle hiring there and said I have this plan

319
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,647
Great costumes do you want them and he said if you can do it sure I'll take them

320
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,487
And and he would have to pay any of them because you were going to get the funding for this

321
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
Will know he was going to hire them at regular teacher salary so I had gone through and just

322
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Was really testing the feasibility will the district

323
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Tire them in

324
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
And I was hearing yes

325
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
If you can actually get them in the

326
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Funders I would need these potential funders and they would say well

327
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,151
It's a good idea but you know it's not going to work

328
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Does the college student

329
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
So the whole

330
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
Plan became let's just show people that the college students want to do it

331
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
So what we did was to

332
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Decide okay we're going to find

333
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Two students at each of 100

334
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
We're going to find one and tell them to go fi

335
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
Find someone who represents a difference

336
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
You know what sort of diversity on that

337
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
And then those two

338
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
People are going to

339
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,471
Essentially put flyers under doors and try to inspire people

340
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
So you you said hey

341
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
If you want to teach in a low-income

342
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
It's cool we can train you and then place you in a school

343
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
And then

344
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
Can you put that out there and did application start

345
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
Yeah I mean the pitch was even it was like

346
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
If you want to be part of the movement

347
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Improve education in America

348
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
And ensure that we live up to our nation

349
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Promise to be a place of

350
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Equal opportunity then

351
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Apply today

352
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,143
And you'll teach for two years and then you'll be part of a

353
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Group of leaders who work

354
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
For the rest of their lives to

355
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
To change

356
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
And

357
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
One of the first people we found

358
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Was a guy

359
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
At Yale actually who

360
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Drafted this flyer

361
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
And he was really the first one he put it under doors

362
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
And within one weekend

363
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
He had 170

364
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
Voicemail messages on his answering machine

365
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
Saying hey I want to play yes and and there was a man has some of your listeners

366
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Remember Fred hechinger

367
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Who is a columnist at the New York

368
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
X who

369
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
You know I'd met him along the way and he just couldn't believe he know where is this out

370
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
Preen of idealist

371
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Coming from the

372
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Visions of you told that story

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
In an article in The Faults probably October

374
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,063
And so one thing would lead to another people start realizing wow I mean this generation does want to do that so

375
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
The donors who were

376
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Not

377
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,743
You know making a decision decided some of them okay we'll get behind this the school district started

378
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Taking it more seriously

379
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
So everything was coming together

380
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
The only massive

381
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Problem was

382
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
That we were nowhere near present

383
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Million-dollar

384
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
You

385
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Are going out

386
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Basically advertising

387
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
2

388
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Tencent

389
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Hunter College

390
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Apply for the

391
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
But like you didn't really have a guarantee

392
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
Ironclad guarantee that that you could actually

393
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Place them in any job

394
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
He was really just kind of

395
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
And you were kind of

396
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Hoping it would work out

397
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Yeah well

398
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
That is as I look back

399
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
Like you that maybe how it looks mean at the time it didn't

400
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Seem soap

401
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Precariously

402
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
There were real

403
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Teacher shortages in these

404
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Districts

405
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Talk to

406
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
FedEx in many of these districts and realize that they really

407
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Wanted

408
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
To hire these folks

409
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
And so

410
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
It didn't seem as precarious as it sounds now

411
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
So how many

412
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Applications did you get

413
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
We had 2500

414
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
People apply

415
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
How many spots

416
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Could you

417
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
You were aiming for 500

418
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
So

419
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Wow I mean how many of you were now

420
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Running this organization like

421
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
Four five

422
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Well

423
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
You know it just kept holding on

424
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
South Bend

425
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
We had all these applique

426
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Patience we had underestimated

427
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Everything

428
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
What to do

429
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Do with 2500 go through 5

430
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
2500

431
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Yes

432
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
That's a very good question

433
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
But we hadn't thought through

434
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,975
But one thing we did was say okay we're going to send teams of 2 out in

435
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
You don't actually

436
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
I got the head of

437
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Hurts to donate Rent-A-Car so we had

438
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
Five rent-a-cars and we were going to send to people I need to them

439
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Off to interview these

440
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
So they would eat steak

441
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,823
Parts of the country and they would drive from campus to campus and would do these interviews and we had

442
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,663
Created a day-long application process that you know

443
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,503
Start with an essay application and then they do the sample teaching session and

444
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
And interviewing we have had someone go out and develop this kind of

445
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Selection process

446
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,719
And by the way this is about when I mean you know we have these teams out on the road

447
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
And there

448
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
Spoke and

449
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
I'm thinking

450
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
We don't have it

451
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Money

452
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215

The Scramble for money

454
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
A mutiny in the ranks

455
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
The struggle

456
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Just stay alive

498

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

499
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
Gyros so it's the spring of 1990

500
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:18,047
And Wendy is about to train pfas very first class of teachers

501
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
The only problem is

502
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,679
She's short on money like two and a half a million dollar short

503
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
Kind of a Hail Mary move

504
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
When he decides to contact Ross Perot who at the time was one of the richest businessmen in Tech

505
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,015
Texas and you might have heard of him because he ran for president in the early 1990s

506
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
He's from Dallas and I'm from Dallas and and he's really into education reform and when I was growing up Ross Perot as a busy

507
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Just leader in Texas was no really fighting for all this legislation to improve the school so I had never

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,655
Never met him but I just had in my head he was going to fund this

509
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
And and Ross Perot doesn't doesn't think I wrote him 11 letters before he agreed to see me but

510
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
We have different memories he called me up

511
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,599
I actually thought it was a friend of mine cuz everyone knew I was trying to get to Ross Perot and someone yells down

512
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
The hall

513
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Ross Perot is on the line and I pick up

514
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
The phone and say yep I thinking

515
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
This is one of my

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
My friends

517
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Pulling a prank

518
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:28,192
And I hear his voice on the other end you know which is very recognizable in like oh my God and I said to him I'm coming.

519
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Dallas I'm going to be there

520
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
Next week can I come see you and he agreed and

521
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,848
What happened when you went down there

522
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
Well when I walked into Ross Perot's office

523
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
I felt like I was at the end

524
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Like I had tried

525
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
Everything I had tried to access everyone and I knew

526
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Either

527
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
He supports this or

528
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
I just really don't know where else

529
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Turn

530
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
So I I literally told myself

531
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
And I've often

532
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Wished I could be as

533
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
I won't leave his office

534
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Seminole

535
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Glue myself

536
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
To the chairman

537
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
His office and I'm not going to leave

538
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Until he

539
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
You say to him

540
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
This my thing is my program and what did you ask him

541
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
For how much

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Well I asked him for $1000000

543
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
I needed you know another 2 million

544
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Basically

545
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
And

546
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Keyspan I mean I was in there for

547
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Probably 2 hours

548
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
And

549
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,328
He spent the whole time thinking about his friends who would do this to me really loved the idea

550
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
And he kept saying I think Sam Walton would do this and

551
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
I kept thinking oh now I know where all this leads like no

552
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Like you are the one I know you're the one who care about education

553
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
Haitian you you're an entrepreneur you understand this

554
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
And he finally I actually think he decided I wasn't going to leave

555
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
And he said I'll tell you what

556
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
I will give you $500,000

557
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
If you can raise the other 1.5 L

558
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
And that was the moment I knew it's done like I knew that his

559
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
His credibility

560
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
And that

561
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Can Leverage

562
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
I could just go back to everyone else in that they would all

563
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
You can go back to our house to say Ross Perot has committed $500,000

564
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
I need your money

565
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Yep in order to Leverage

566
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah

567
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,640
All right so so did you I'm assuming you raise the money after arrest

568
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Yep

569
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
The one year after I graduated I was

570
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,600
Literally looking out an auditorium full of 489

571
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
Recent grads who are all in the auditorium at us

572
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Hereafter

573
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Keep right when you have to

574
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
You got it you got these

575
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
489

576
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
College graduates in this room

577
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,240
Ready for 45 weeks

578
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,080
Train from DIA tweaks to go to the LA Unified School District

579
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,432
Net well they were during the summer they were but then they would go to the one at 6

580
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,272
Places where we had decided to Cluster them and where the school district

581
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
Agreed to hire them

582
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
The word a New York City in the NL a New Orleans Baton Rouge in Southern Louisiana

583
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Cannon to World sites in in World Middle Georgia and

584
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Eastern North Carolina

585
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
And they had to make a two-year commitment

586
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
So I mean

587
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
Ifi'm remember correctly you were not a teacher you did not study

588
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Did not have a teaching credential

589
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
Like how did you know how to train

590
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
I didn't know an end

591
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
You know that's why we found

592
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
This

593
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Experience teacher Educators in an experience

594
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
Teachers who had a specialty in

595
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
You know preparing and supporting

596
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,632
Teachers in urban and rural areas and we really just turns the whole thing over to them to her that first summer go of

597
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
It was terrifying

598
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
You know I mean

599
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:47,104
It was the first year we had 489 people cooped up in dorms for 8 week

600
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
A diverse group not as diverse as you know we would all hoping his

601
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Teach for America is achieved at this point but

602
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
And we had a

603
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Max

604
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,648
The folks who had never been in

605
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
An environment like this and we're never

606
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Many of them who had

607
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Been working in

608
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,864
Urban rural communities so there was just a lot

609
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,448
Of tension and a lot of issues to sort through and it was

610
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
It was very

611
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
And I was exhausted

612
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
YouTube

613
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
Start teaching and you see the microcosm

614
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Of the world

615
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Playing out in your car

616
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
You know you see kids

617
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
2

618
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
Are facing all the challenges

619
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Poverty and lack of adequate

620
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Healthcare nutritionist

621
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Racial discrimination the whole bed

622
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
And

623
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
It's very overwhelming

624
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
So the pioneering Force

625
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Four members

626
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Hi-Tech

627
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
Find their way to solution

628
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
You don't often from other teachers in their schools and

629
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
Ultimately we're learning from them

630
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
Once that first class of teachers went

631
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
Are schools in

632
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Start to teach

633
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Did you just have to get right back on the fundraising

634
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Hamster wheel

635
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,392
I mean this and an on the recruitment

636
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
Sidon you know it gets it's a cycle rate like every year and

637
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
So yeah the fundraising never stop

638
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Kind of an ongoing underlying

639
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,704
Casella's were all of your Revenue was going

640
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Come from

641
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
Different fundraising right

642
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
It's a non-profit

643
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Search for different from

644
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
SSS mention the other companies

645
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Switch on the show

646
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
But it does you were running a business

647
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
I mean you were a Christian

648
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,648
In the hardest pieces you say was about recruiting selecting training supporting them but then

649
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
There was how do you manage them

650
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
I had no idea what I was doing

651
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
I mean I hadn't really

652
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
Really idealistic Notions you know we should all make the same salary and there shouldn't be any hierarchy and all sorts of things

653
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
Which now I might think

654
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Maybe this path to some of that

655
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
But at the time

656
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Chaos

657
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
And and then ultimately

658
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Most importantly me there also

659
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
The political earnings you know how do you navigate the politics

660
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Pics of education but probably most

661
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Fundamentally

662
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Can't do anything

663
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Without resource

664
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
How are weaknesses

665
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Stainless things

666
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
Financially because none of those donors

667
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Thought they were going to stick with it

668
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Yeah

669
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
And we were losing donors in

670
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
In like half a million a million

671
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Docker chunks

672
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
And

673
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Sweetly convert the

674
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
The funny bass essentially

675
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
And that kind of

676
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
Threw us into

677
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
What I think of as the dark years of

678
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Teach for America you know what like

679
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Every paycheck

680
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Every payroll

681
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
You know there's a question about whether we were going

682
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Meet at

683
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Was there something

684
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
That happened during

685
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
That. That was

686
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Particularly difficult

687
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,648
If there was so much

688
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Probably the most

689
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Excruciating moment

690
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
Was

691
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
When President Clinton

692
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Launched

693
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
Americorps

694
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
List national service initiative

695
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Teach for America was one of those

696
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
First partners

697
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
Americorps and said that Federal funding really gave us

698
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
But the second year

699
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
There was

700
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
2 question actually about our

701
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
Financial viability

702
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
And so

703
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,856
The defects were operating Americorps

704
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Wooden

705
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Approved

706
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
I granth

707
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
To Teach for America

708
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
And

709
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
This is about

710
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
June

711
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
And we have five

712
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Teachers

713
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Think that they're going

714
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
Going to training but we didn't have

715
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
The money to even

716
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Buy them there

717
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
And so I felt like

718
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
This is at

719
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
Either we get the governmental approval

720
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Or

721
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
We shut it down

722
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
And we were ready I mean we were ready

723
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
To FedEx

724
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
Letters to all five

725
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
People saying

726
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
We can't make it

727
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
You're not going to be able to come

728
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
And

729
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
We could not get

730
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
Anyone in the government

731
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
You know I'm still in

732
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,560
20 is 20 whatever we still had

733
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,656
Only so much credibility and we're dealing with these governmental

734
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Official

735
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,312
And you know we were taking ourselves a lot more seriously than they were taking us let's just say but

736
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Ultimately at about

737
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
One minute

738
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Before we would have

739
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Posh Salon

740
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
You know

741
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,272
Plan B after shutting it down they finally came through but that was

742
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
One of many many examples of

743
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
The extreme stress

744
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
Sarah I mean what how much money did you need

745
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
Toot It To Me payroll

746
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Watch MTV

747
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Well

748
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
I mean I think that Grant

749
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,120
The big one you know is probably one and a half million

750
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
Frost

751
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
When and why did it come in at the last

752
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
I mean we were calling every

753
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
Sing

754
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Person

755
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Lever

756
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Possibly

757
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Come up with

758
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,944
And ultimately I guess we wore them down

759
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
But you know these things happen

760
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Like this is what happens in Vegas

761
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,184
Bureaucracies and it's what happens to social entrepreneurs you know I mean ultimately it all works out

762
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
Appreciate the ecosystem

763
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
The

764
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
And that's why

765
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Teach for America Ulta

766
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Smelly

767
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,656
Thrived but I think it's kind of the definition of social entrepreneurship

768
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,752
There aren't natural funding sources so you you almost have to

769
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Create them in Alton

770
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
What we buy your existing

771
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
It's helped shape them in

772
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Until that happened it's the

773
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Just excruciatingly

774
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
I need to make it

775
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,248
Wendy I guess at a certain point maybe maybe it was about five years

776
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Teach for America

777
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
The staff

778
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,696
I'd like they've they've revolted a rebelde all friend request what was going on

779
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Oh gosh that was even earlier I mean

780
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,840
I think it was our second year actually we were all at our training in

781
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
Institute and

782
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
I was still I had this notion of no hierarchy

783
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Which was a genuine notion I just thought

784
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
If we're all on the same

785
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
You know we're on the same Mission why do we need a hierarchical self-direct

786
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,272
But people decided this was because I wanted to control everything and

787
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,648
They just decided unless we can make all Decisions by vote we're all walking out the door how many people said that

788
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Well it was everyone

789
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
Sitting in a room

790
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,072
People are 15 people

791
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Suicide

792
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,424
If we can't vote on every decision by democratic

793
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
And so would you do

794
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Well disappointed

795
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,128
To know what to do I was honestly still remembers like midnight I'm so exhausted

796
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
And one of our

797
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,272
Staff members who turned into my husband later much later

798
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
Raises hand and said Wendy

799
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
I mean I was making no sense and wasn't being response

800
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
So what I'm hearing you say

801
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,048
Is that we're not going to make all Decisions by vote

802
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Is that right

803
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
And even then I had like I should have said yes

804
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
But now if so we all left

805
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
And the next morning I sent out

806
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Note saying

807
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,104
You know we're not going to make decisions by vote and you know what no one left

808
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
Any truth in what they were saying like were you autocrat

809
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Jamaican in your style

810
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Let's just say

811
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
I wasn't autocratic in Maya

812
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Concussion

813
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
You know I really did have this thought that everyone should just

814
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Do the right thing

815
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
You know it was just not

816
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
In itself out as in

817
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
And it's so I'm sure that there was some truth

818
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
On all sides

819
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
When you are

820
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
24 or whatever

821
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
25 however old you are

822
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
The time in

823
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
The whole team is like hey we want to

824
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Vote of no confidence

825
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Even even if it wasn't but it

826
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
What kind of Lies

827
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Did you did it

828
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Shaky

829
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Did you sleep feel like

830
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Did it

831
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
Exacerbating self-doubt

832
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Oh yes

833
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
It did

834
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
But I didn't know what

835
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
I mean part of what

836
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Was leading me

837
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
Stay in it was just

838
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Ascent of response

839
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Disability like

840
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
I couldn't figure out how to get out of it

841
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
I mean honestly if someone had a

842
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Appeared

843
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
So I felt like

844
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Get us out of this

845
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
And get us to

846
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
Point of stability or some

847
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
I think I would have just turn the whole thing over to the

848
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
There's no doubt about that I mean I was

849
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
In fact I was

850
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Looking for

851
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,464
I couldn't seem to find the answer other than to keep put my head down and key

852
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Keep going at it

853
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
Until we could get out of

854
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Once you get out of bed

855
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
You know

856
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Became more financially stable

857
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Were you able to

858
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
To start seeing the impact

859
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Teach for America

860
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Well I think

861
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
I mean we were seeing even your five we were

862
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Starting to see real evidence of

863
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Beyond the immediate impact of Art

864
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,272
Teachers of what some of our alumni were starting

865
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
To do

866
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Like we were starting to see

867
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,720
The big idea play itself out these people aren't leaving their dedicating themselves

868
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,048
Sylvester becoming the pioneering leaders we thought they could be so

869
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,144
That's what kept us going through these dark years like realizing that

870
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
This really

871
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Is Agatha chilling it really is working

872
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,056
Because we were seeing enough evidence in classrooms

873
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
And enough Avenue

874
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,640
Even a whole school's that actually

875
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
When you meet kids

876
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,272
Who are facing a lot of challenges and have a lot of assets but

877
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
You don't with high expectations Amex

878
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
Support they need they'll Excel

879
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
An absolute

880
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Scale soap

881
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
That

882
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Recognition is what

883
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,048
Really inspired us to say okay how do we take this to the next level

884
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
Azteca America really starts

885
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Takeoff and

886
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
And grow and grow and get more and more

887
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Attention

888
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
You also

889
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
With more visibility

890
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Thomas More criticism

891
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
And I just

892
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
Trying to sing me you were

893
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Still pretty young

894
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,944
You had no teaching experience and there were

895
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
Professional Educators who are kind of going after you

896
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,832
Criticizing Teach for America everything from

897
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
This is your wife

898
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
Eternalism of middle-class wealthy kids

899
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Going into

900
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Poor neighborhoods

901
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Color to

902
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
You know there's not enough

903
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Training to

904
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
You know they're only there for two years is too sexy

905
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Disruptive

906
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Did that

907
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
Did the curse of hurt you did it

908
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Digital

909
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Keep you up at night

910
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
You know we were

911
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Working

912
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
Very hard to get better you know when the criticism actually started

913
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Pretty early on I mean it

914
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
You don't this wasn't

915
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Constant

916
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
Fred

917
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
During

918
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
First decade actually but

919
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,600
In a way we were our own harshest critic

920
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
When we were

921
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Tearing ourselves

922
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Funny weed

923
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Felt that we needed

924
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Do things a lot

925
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Better

926
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
So

927
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
I guess our assessment was

928
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
The world isn't going to be better

929
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
If we shut down

930
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Teach for America

931
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
So there's really only one option

932
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
What does de get better

933
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
So you just it didn't it didn't faze you

934
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Well

935
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,640
It's not that it didn't I mean the fact is it made the work so much

936
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
More difficult

937
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
It's easy now

938
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
2

939
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
Justify a decision to

940
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Go off

941
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
To work for the consulting firm

942
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,136
I'm 40 years to don't even Teach for America really good

943
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Thing like there's enough

944
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Question out there

945
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
They're in the

946
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,304
Blogosphere you know and then so it definitely made the work more.

947
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Call but

948
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:51,680
You know it was the criticism became probably at its most extreme

949
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
We were seeing incredible

950
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
In communities

951
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:01,408
I mean when we started placing teachers in Washington DC it was the lowest-performing of all the major Urban District

952
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
Kids for 2 years behind the kids in Harlem

953
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
And

954
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,296
You don't now it's graduation rates

955
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
Enrollment rates everything moving in the right direction

956
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
And the fact is if you talk the teachforamerica people out of that City not just the teachers during the two years right but the

957
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
Teachers who are still in the system and the

958
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
The school principals and the last two schools chancellors who presided over the system for a decade and one of them

959
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,824
Save an alarm of

960
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
And that's one city

961
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,736
I mean name a city I could tell you the stats like it's really they become such a leadership Forest

962
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
For changing the city so

963
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
You know you can critique it all you want

964
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
But

965
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
I guess my view is

966
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,000
Proposed the Alternatives write like we have here

967
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
Deeply entrenched

968
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
And

969
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Systemic

970
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Issue

971
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
It cannot be solved from within classrooms

972
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Write this is

973
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,080
No amount of teaching is going to solve that we need incredible teachers

974
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
But we also need

975
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Some of those people who understand what you understand

976
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Teaching

977
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
And decide I'm not go

978
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Costco prints

979
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
Schools and some who say I'm going to work

980
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,904
System one summer's day I'm going to run for office cuz we got to change the policy contact

981
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,232
I'm going to start something that proves the child welfare system

982
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Is that

983
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Until we do that we will never solve

984
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
This problem

985
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
And that's what Teach for America is trying to do so

986
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,752
I know that and I know that we need to stay the course because I have yet to see another thing that's made of

987
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
Bigger difference in really tackling

988
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
The systemic challenges

989
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
It's full complexity

990
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
And the critics

991
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
You know I wish they dive in and help us

992
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Do better

993
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Essentially

994
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
What's Teach for America

995
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Budget today

996
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
It's about 300 million

997
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Cute

998
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
It's gone from Two and a half million

999
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
300 million

1000
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
Funny

1001
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Teachers does it

1002
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
They're about

1003
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
You know

1004
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
7 to 8000

1005
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Teachers at any given

1006
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
+ 50000 alumni

1007
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,616
Most of whom I will say are still in the work

1008
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Wendy train

1009
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
I think anybody hearing this

1010
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Conclude that you could have been a

1011
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
Start up business

1012
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
A for-profit company

1013
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
And

1014
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Probably

1015
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
Metronome

1016
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Do you have

1017
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Talent

1018
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Vince Gill

1019
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
To do that and

1020
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
And I wonder whether

1021
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
You could have gone on a

1022
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,240
And on that and let's say you had three hundred million dollars now you could have just been a huge philanthropist

1023
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
Given 300 million dollars to

1024
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Education

1025
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
Projects in your name would be everywhere to be the Wendy Kopp building for Education reform and people showing up to you would have

1026
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Who knows but it's

1027
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Just not

1028
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
There's really not

1029
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,392
A bone in my body I feel like I don't even know how I would

1030
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Do that like

1031
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
You know what everyone's cut out for

1032
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,488

Of course but

1036
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,608
I don't even I have not one insta

1037
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Do that right like I'm

1038
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
So to this day I'm I've never been more energized

1039
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
Like 27 or however many years in

1040
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
You know like this is really all I've ever won

1041

Yuan to do

1042
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,576
That's Wendy Kopp founder of Teach for America

1043
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
In 2013 she stepped down

1044
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,208
Yelp also co-founded teach for all

1045
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
Which partners with organizations all over the world

1046

Sticking around because it

1075
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Timeout for how you built that

1076
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
A story that we were about a year ago in 2015 Abby kircher

1077
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
There was a teenager with a food obsession

1078
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Cups peanut butter ice cream I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

1079
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
But one day a beaded something that you probably shouldn't do with a food you eat everyday

1080
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
She looked at the label and I was just like oh my gosh this is so much sugar tons of additives in

1081
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
Preservatives and so it just doesn't feel like it's almost peanut butter in anymore you know it just feels kind of like a sugar

1082
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
Spread to go cold turkey on Peanut Butter but of course she missed eating it

1083
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
So I was like I might as well make my own there's no reason why I couldn't make my own so that's why I Just Whipped out of

1084
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:31,136
Food processor and just tried it out this was by the way her mom's food processor into what she put

1085
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Some nuts

1086
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,744
And coconut oil and salt and eventually took

1087
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,840
Forever it turned into a creamy texture I was like wow this is so cool

1088
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,448
I got very excited then I was like okay how do I want to flavor this or Sweeney

1089
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,776
So I threw in some dates

1090
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,592
Process. A little bit and it was

1091
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
So good

1092
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,663
So good in fact that Abby started

1093
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
Spreading peanut butter on everything

1094
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,783
Apple sandwiches pancakes even salad

1095
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,111
And she began sharing it with her family and friends

1096
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
And then

1097
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
One night

1098
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
I went into my room and it was

1099
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,559
Quite literally an aha moment

1100
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,375
I can start a business and she was like

1101
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,775
Alright yeah absolutely it's a good thing Abby's mom and dad were on board because remember

1102
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Abby was like

1103
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
15 at the time

1104
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
So she needed her parents help to

1105
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,479
Track down jars and labels in a commercial kitchen to make the nut butter

1106
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
I'm still making a lot of the big decision

1107
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,647
Like early on she actually decided to forget about peanuts

1108
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,951
And the branch out into other types of nuts

1109
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:44,351
I wanted something a little different and I I realize there weren't a lot of pecan and cashew butter is out there at the time

1110
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
Abby came up with five recipes

1111
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
Each with just a handful of ingredients

1112
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Flavors like bait Baccano

1113
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
Strawberry cashew

1114
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Copy almond

1115
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
And Sheena Montana set up a standard

1116
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,687
Big farmers market just outside Charlotte

1117
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
Call people over

1118
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,319
They were all incredibly

1119
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,647
Story and how young I was they would always look at my mom be like so

1120
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
You started this and she'd be like nope

1121
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
Anyway they kept selling out at the Farmers Market

1122
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
And people kept asking for more

1123
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,935
It was getting hard because they were still packing the jars of nut butter themselves and

1124
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,471
How are they doing that

1125
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,103
Spoons believe it or not many spoons many many 1/2

1126
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
That was the worst

1127
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,783
Part for sure it just took so long so few months later they got a machine to do the jarring for

1128
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,135
They were pitching their nut butter at local grocery stores

1129
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
For a young girl and her mom to walk in there excited about a product and it made them excited

1130
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
And I think that was

1131
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
A huge factor in our growth

1132
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,191
Less than two years after a bee started making nut Butters

1133
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,031
They were selling them like 300 grocery stores in the Charlotte area

1134
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
In overtime and it wasn't just Abby and her mom doing this

1135
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,503
Older brother join the business and her dad actually quit his job to join them as well

1136
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,343
Play I'm the boss of my parents and brother yes

1137
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,743
Which is definitely a learning experience trying to figure out okay what are our positions in the business

1138
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:20,095
This regardless of our positions in the family

1139
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
4 years now

1140
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:27,519
And her nut Butters of spread to nearly 1,000 stores across the east coast and the Midwest

1141
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
I'm putting some pretty big chain

1142
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
Like Wegmans and Lowe's

1143
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,223
Abby's nut butter is expected to pull in 1.6 million dollars is

1144
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,831
You're pretty amazing for a CEO who is now just 19 years old

1145
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,159
Young entrepreneur and starting at such a young age

1146
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,743
You know I didn't think that I can't do it I just thought I could

1147
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,839
It's such an incredible opportunity in a blessing

1148
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
The business

1149
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
It's called Abby's better than

1150
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:02,591
