1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
I would order the stuff out of Taiwan and I would give myself 60 days

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Get the money together.

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Read a report to come pick it up so you have to make that same time you don't know

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Know what you're going to do

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
If I didn't I would never do it

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists at the stories

7
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm guy Roz antonym

8
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
A special live recording

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,272
Story of beyond meat a company that wants to take the chicken and burgers off your plate

10
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Replace them with plants

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,392
And do it in a way where you will never know the difference

12
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
Took to the show is a little different from the others

13
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
The story of a startup that is still in many ways

14
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Best startup

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,288
The company beyond meat has not yet turned a profit added CEO and founder Ethan Brown

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
Definitely not a billionaire

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
We start yet

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,944
But he is part of a movement that is it takes off

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Could come

20
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Completely transform the way we think

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
About food

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
Because think about it if you are a meat eater there is nothing more delicious than a freshly grilled steak or

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
Or a basket of fried chicken rice

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Ethan says you can have all of that but the meat doesn't have to come from a cow or a chicken again

25
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Actually come from plants

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,264
Keys and lentils and stuff like that but here's the thing

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
It won't taste like a pathetic vegetarian Subs

28
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
Steven says that at some point in the future

29
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
Maybe sooner than you think

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,296
Meat eaters will not be able to tell the difference between animal meat

31
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
And plant

32
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,904
And find out how he's in his trying to make that happen

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,488
Set down in front of a live audience in Anaheim California

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Here's part of that conversation

35
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Welcome

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Thank you very much for having me

37
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
It's an honor to be

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
So

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
I want to start by asking you a little bit about

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
How you grew up cuz you grew up

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Around

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Farms around animals rights

43
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
Right so I have an interesting childhood in it I grew up in the city

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
But my father is a professor

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
McGill now

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
And

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
He grew up in the country

48
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
And had a love for the

49
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
It really defines who he is

50
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
And so we spent an enormous amount of time

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
In the countryside and he bought a Farm Bureau Leon

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
He bought a farm just like

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
A farm where

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,824
She'll get a couple different ones but that was the one that was for the dominant one

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
I'm within my childhood was in Western Maryland

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
And soda can a Holstein

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Dairy business

58
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
What about a hundred head

59
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Cattle

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,392
So we spent a lot of time there as I when I was a child and then

61
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Side hustle was milking cows

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Something like that so growing up around animals and in did you eat

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912
Animals when you were a kid but definitely I definitely ate a lot of meat

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
My favorite

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Sandwich was the Double R burger from Roy Rogers

66
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Wow what's that

67
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
That's so it would have ham

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
And I don't have cheese and her have the burger and cheeseburger

69
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah exactly and and so as I became conscious of what I was doing

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
What about the older teenager

71
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
I began to think about that to this is the end of the milk from the cows

72
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Miniature pig

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Orgy of of the

74
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Different animals

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
So how did you

76
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
When did you start to begin to think about animals differently

77
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
I should know we should say I should

78
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
You are today a vegan you do not eat animal products right you don't even wear animal

79
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
I don't see these are these are $35

80
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
From

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Target your shoes are

82
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Faux leather

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
But

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,832
The early on I began to think differently about animals I wanted to be a vet

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
I would spend time in our attic or the employer Farm

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
And I would I would build large cages for for mice

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
No cash for the mice and Have a Heart Traps

88
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
And I put him in his cage and they were very different

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Fly across the kids right

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
And it was it to me it was as wonderful world and I loved

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Is it right now in Seoul

92
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
For me the

93
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
Experience was about getting a nosey animal

94
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
And celebrate

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
They took you out of work it out if it is not coherent United still

96
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Eating meat in Wasilla

97
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Using animal products

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
But that early inkling about how I feel differently about animals

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
The news around me

100
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
So you you go to college

101
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
Did you think that you would be entrepreneur I mean you got an MBA was that your

102
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
Should have Vision in the hydrogen fuel cell

103
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Scepter this is after you get your MBA

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
Gurney yeah yeah so I worked there about 10 years

105
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
And I was answering that for reason

106
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
The climate seems to be doing

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Something that was

108
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Socially oriented

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
So

110
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
So when did you like Woodford

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
LED you to start to think about

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Animals livestock

113
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Trailer something that

114
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
Turn all that he was like it was something that even

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
As I was

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
Climbing the corporate ladder within the

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
The cleantech space

118
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
It just kept coming back

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Go something that I felt like I had to go do

120
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
I'm going to literally that strong

121
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,319
And so I chat with that for a long time and I begin to think about it not just

122
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
In terms of my own feelings about animals

123
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Child

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
But

125
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Interesting Billy that's the number one issue

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
And today I still think about this way if you think about

127
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
Affecting really difficult problems

128
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
All at once

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
By changing out the protein attended play

130
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Capri Palace affect human health

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
What are you having a heart disease diabetes

132
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Cancel all these things are linked

133
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
To certain types of meat consumption

134
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Did the climate change

135
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Peanuts by 51%

136
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
A greenhouse gas emission

137
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
It's from from from

138
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
To put it bluntly

139
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
Burps and farts right some percent of it

140
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
A way to get your head around

141
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
So we fought about 66 million animals

142
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
66 billion around the world

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
All those animals are breathing

144
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
When they breathe

145
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Aspire carbon

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
Toyota Corolla number of livestock

147
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
Shrinking number. If you have a carbon cycle it's out of balance

148
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
And so

149
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
That's why this last issue

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Important focus on

151
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
So how did you go from

152
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Starting to think about livestock and climate change

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
Just saying you know what I'm going to give up this fuel cell stop and

154
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Like tackle this problem

155
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
I was

156
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
My twenties miss her late twenties

157
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
I was thinking about this I want to create a

158
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Plant-based McDonald's

159
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Plant-based McDonald's

160
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Then I was in a relation

161
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
I wanted to get out of work I wasn't very good at getting out of

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
I'd like I moved and all these other things

163
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Send it in a way that wasn't very

164
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Freeport

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,991
So I was

166
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
It never leave start on my career

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,391
And I was like I really have a feeling I want to go start this plant

168
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
McDonald's

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Did you even know how to cook

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Lydia pretty poorly and so I really want to do this

171
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
What's in your heart

172
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
I know

173
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
I didn't do it

174
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
I spent like 7-8 more years you know

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,311
Working on cleantech because that's what I was supposed to do

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
You know and I had this

177
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
I said this before

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
I remember

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Seeing

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
And reading Of Mice and Men

181
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Looking at Lennie and being like

182
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
Unlike big

183
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
I don't wanna be that guy likes

184
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Virgos like sentimental Ethan

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,119
You know like I did I wasn't serious enough for me or something like that you know

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
I was afraid to be compassion

187
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
It's so funny when I look at guys like

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
When to sell a phone

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Humane Society

190
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
I really admire them

191
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
But surely on there like

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
Is what I feel is going to act on in the world and it took me awhile to

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
She said

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
The things that I thought I was supposed to be doing

195
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
So how did you

196
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
Getting the courage to leave the stable job and

197
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Start to

198
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Think about

199
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Making

200
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Faking well

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Show

202
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
First

203
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
You're a very small kids literally just born

204
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335

00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Mount Rushmore

206
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
This world

207
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,271
And my wife grew up in the country and until we've had meeting our house Moschino kids meeting

208
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Justice is not

209
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Weavers way

210
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
And I want to make a difference

211
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
And so

212
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
It started to come out

213
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Pretzel meaning we got these pet

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535

Caterpillar Farm

216
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
And they were wondering

217
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,447
That same time would be like on Jersey Turnpike and let the kids need some to eat

218
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727

219
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Precise Barber go to Subway

220

I literally

221
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Feel

222
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
This disconnect in my life right that I got to do something

223
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
It was it was at personal calling and then it was

224
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Sitting in this meeting

225
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Working on climate

226
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
To clean tech

227
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
I began to feel like

228
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
We were just not getting

229
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Take a picture

230
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
And they being big hotels like this

231
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
And we bring our hands but how do you get

232
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Percent workers in Seattle

233
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655

Steak dinner

236
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Just doesn't

237
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Make sense let's attack

238
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
The real problem

239
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
And not really motivated me

240
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
I started to work at night on it

241
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
And this is the great thing about

242
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
Time period in history is the internet

243
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
I'll come home

244
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Kids go to bed

245
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,279
I would just set up another the most living in Capitol Hill time

246
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
And I'll research

247
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
He would like go to Google and type in

248
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
Textured soy protein meat or

249
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
You don't need an animal

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Tripolis Pizza

251
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
But that was the core belief that I'd be into half listed like

252
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
I could see that you could get

253
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
The Demeter really five things as its amino acids

254
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
It's lipids

255
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
It's a very small amount of carbohydrates

256
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Ana.

257
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Trace minerals

258
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
Also very small family water

259
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
What's incremental fabulous

260
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
They're not exclusive to the animal they're all absolutely present

261
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
And the plank

262
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,215
So the animals doing

263
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Massive amount of plant matter

264
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
The running through their system they're crazy muscle

265
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
Why can't we take Plan B

266
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,455
Running through a system increase muscle and that's all we're doing research who's

267
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Taking protein from plant

268
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
And reorganizing

269
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
And a guy two guys at the University of Missouri

270
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,023
You just like came across an academic paper

271
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
From Asia that I thought was really good

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
Nashua

273
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
Texturized pizza store that sell with quite close to muscle

274
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Bring it in

275
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Pain in front of woman

276
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Selling it in

277
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Whole Foods

278
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,175
In the Mid-Atlantic area at night or on the side you were you start of the second sort of a

279
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
A business where you were importing food

280
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
That's hilarious it was it was it was so I would

281
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
I would order the stuff out of Taiwan

282
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
And I would get myself

283
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
60 days to get the money together.

284
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
The paperwork

285
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Port and I always did

286
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
One of the money

287
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Then you get charged every day or an important

288
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Pick it up

289
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Right so you have to sign

290
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
How to make girlfriend to call for the thing about

291
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
I think one important thing

292
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Most innings in history

293
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
You don't

294
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
I know what you're going to do what

295
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
People doing it to your backs against

296
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Cuz I would put myself in that

297
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Yeah because if I didn't I would never

298
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Elsa toys

299
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Letgo

300
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
And then get yourself in a position

301
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
And you'll figure it out

302
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,255
So you you read this academic paper

303
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
Buy these professors at the University of Missouri

304
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
What did you just call him up and say what you say

305
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
I work with you

306
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
But came out there and I started to it

307
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,199
And what was he doing he was making plant-based

308
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
Yeah yeah he was he was basically taking

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Proteins

310
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,647
Could have been corn

311
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
And he was using heating cooling and pressure

312
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
2

313
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
Realign them so they stitched until muscle like fiber

314
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
So you go out there and you meet him and what would you like

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
So

316
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
What is very good what what what they were doing but I didn't think it was

317
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Ready for Market at all

318
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
So caught up in the recent Maryland

319
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
I said I've got this

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Technology

321
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Missouri weather

322
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Can I work with

323
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Maryland

324
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
And improve it

325
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
So I got a grant

326
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Citic antenna research to basically

327
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Try to get it ready for me

328
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
That's why I was funding out of my own pocket

329
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
But I also got my

330
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,607
So it would this is running on just a shoestring are you independently wealthy

331
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
You had to basically

332
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Yes oh my soul my home

333
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
It's funny you set up all these

334
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Founders come never touch that

335
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,455
So you decided

336
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
You said I'm going to start a business and I'm going to sell my house

337
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Kids at the point

338
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:52,767
Thought they were like super like you wanted to or something

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Yeah but she says about everything I do

340
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
I don't know

341
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
And in this is what round 2009

342
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
And what are you doing for the first few years you just going back and forth to misery from Ireland

343
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
Running with a good as it tastes good as it was eating gross stuff too

344
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
It was it was funny so I would use

345
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Southwest

346
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
To go from BWI

347
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,231
And I'll take big duffle bag to the stuff back and forth

348
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
And there was a time when we're the busted open it just fell out over all the plan was like this like this like this like chicken

349
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,847
Did it I was also though importing this product from Asia and selling it to Whole Foods

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,223
I think that also gave me some credibility with that I wasn't just for dreaming about something I had it going

351
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Concerned with small

352
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
But I'm selling into Whole Foods and then and I can say very truthfully about Whole Foods that I wouldn't be here without them

353
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
Helping hand every chance I get

354
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
You didn't have a background in

355
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
I mean you you were working at at

356
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Fuel cell

357
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Nobody but you wouldn't know

358
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,543
Training and cooking or food or the food industry like

359
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
How did you even get Whole Foods to take you

360
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
How did you even

361
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,991
Begin to go to investors and tell them about this idea and why would they have taken you seriously

362
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
So when I got here producer the show asked me just what you're wearing

363
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
You didn't have me

364
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,935
Paper and pencil credentials I mean horse

365
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,543
How did you make the case for what you were doing and how did Jerry Ables it I'm the guy to do this

366
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
That's a really fair question

367
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
I don't know I mean I think one thing that I did learn in business school was

368
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
I think they were wrong about this

369
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,927
Remember that always bring back people who are like super young attractive and

370
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,279
Very successful be like I told this guy to go do this and he did it and you know

371
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
Who are the people that are like living in O in their mom's basement

372
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,959
Eating Ramen right now back to square one

373
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
But one thing that they said was you have to have

374
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Competitive

375
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Moat around what you're doing there has to be some

376
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
The barrier to entry for others

377
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
In order to have successful business

378
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
And I thought that was like

379
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
Stupid

380
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,975
I really can't answer that market right but he didn't believe that

381
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
I think I can

382
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
I just wanted this morning

383
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
That's Ethan Brown of beyond meat and we come back in a moment

384
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,615
The things that still keep him up at night I'm guy Rodney listen to a special live recording

385
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015

Built

413
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,215
It's how I built this from NPR on Gyros

414
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
And the year to after Ethan Brown founded beyond meat

415
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,151
The company start to get some pretty big investors Bill Gates and the founders of

416
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Twitter sign.

417
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
Answer to the Venture Capital company

418
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Kleiner Perkins

419
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
So I initially funded on my own pocket and then we raised money from friends and family we got

420
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Annie's grants

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
But I was running out of mine

422
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
You know what I'd I needed money yeah for the money

423
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
We're opening up in

424
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Old Hospital building

425
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
But he's going to cost money

426
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
So you're selling doing research having facilities we ran out of money they said we needed to go raise money

427
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,759
A lot of rejections or was it like an easy smooth Rider people like yep how can I sign up

428
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
It was hard at first

429
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,111
Stop but Kleiner Perkins got involved

430
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
2010 MR2 look

431
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
And at the time it was not a

432
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Popular decision

433
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Guidestar

434
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,959
I'm grateful for that and once they got involved in another scandal

435
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,847
Let's talk about what this product

436
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,943
Started to become so how are you making it with you taking like

437
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,551
Soy powder and in gluten from wheat and like

438
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,671
Putting in a machine and it was coming out of me take me

439
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,743
So I think it's it it starts with

440
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Apperception

441
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
So my argument is

442
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
That this is

443
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
They just meet

444
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Comfrey plants

445
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
And so I think it important

446
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Station when the company is we don't talk about people not eating meat

447
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
I don't think it's a good idea to build a brand

448
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Telling people not to eat with a low

449
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
What is a good idea to allow you to eat more of what they love

450
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
And if you love me

451
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
I can give you plant-based me

452
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
If you can

453
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Make our products out of

454
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
Bill lentil protein mustard seed

455
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
Tobacco leaves of grapes

456
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
So today we use

457
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
But it's only

458
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Vince Gill.

459
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,887
But I think the idea is let's look for the most sustainable crops

460
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Confirm that

461
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
And use it a great meeting

462
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,359
So when when were you able to when did you create a product that was ready to go to market you start the company in 2009

463
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Calendar

464
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Take you before

465
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Beyond meat was as it was it a grocery store

466
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,295
That year I started to import something I sold into old age

467
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
But it wasn't until 2011

468
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
And really really 2012

469
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
That we started to

470
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
Put into the market this

471
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Basic structure that we could we could license from

472
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,447
We should still sell

473
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
Most of the stores carry mini frozen sectioning chicken

474
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:05,151
Chicken and beef

475
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
You know I'm coming to the harshest critic of our products

476
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
I love her product

477
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
People are products

478
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
C&S products

479
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
You can see how they're not exactly like animal protein

480
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
And that's osterizer

481
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
But we have to

482
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
The collapse of differences

483
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Akon

484
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Would you have a moonshot

485
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
In a company

486
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Adding bacon from a source invalid to like

487
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,800
Let's show them that we can produce a piece of bacon like a real piece of bacon

488
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
What is the hardest

489
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Part of

490
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
This business

491
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Are the things that keep you up at night to have anxiety is India are you convinced this thing is going to be huge and it's going to be successful

492
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
You think you know this could mail

493
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Absolutely

494
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
Inevitability about we're doing

495
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
Ashley feel that way

496
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,840
I think my anxiety is more around execution and

497
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,192
Want to be better when we be better she go when he better found her want to be better

498
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Better colleague

499
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
You don't let them down

500
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Cause anxiety

501
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Yeah I am a speakers

502
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
I believe in you that take a note

503
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
Although they're so rich anyway doesn't matter I mean let's face it right

504
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,256
When do you think for example like when do you think that you guys will

505
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Be profitable

506
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,144
So we actually have turned a really big corner just recently in terms of

507
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Everything we're doing

508
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
The progression facilities went from Kitchen to a

509
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
Quasi kitchen / Factory

510
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,920
To a factory Missouri and we just have like a brand new facility was a beautiful as I was there twice this week

511
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Dallas Texas

512
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
In this new facility at that scale we get

513
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Really really good Ma

514
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
And so and that's a new thing for us

515
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
Pictures of the casa Productions gun down

516
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
Yeah and then just in and everything

517
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
More streamlined

518
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Prototyping

519
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Improving out stage

520
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:03,680
2 into actually scale production is there a chance that this company could be profitable in 5 years old

521
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
NB does it matter

522
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
Is it important or is it it is enough to be sweet

523
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
It is important

524
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
But I Wrestled a ? because I believe so

525
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Strongly in the research program we have

526
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
And I would find that at the sacrifice of almost anything else

527
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
The company because

528
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
I want to be

529
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
Part of that group of people that

530
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Separate me from Anna

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
When it called

532
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
Said and done I want to look back on this effort and old people working there

533
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,680
Going to get these cases with a remarkable people

534
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
I want to say you guys did this

535
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
And are you guys

536
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Thousand Years

537
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
Humans 40 million years

538
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Consuming meat from animals

539
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
You guys were born and he died and in between that time

540
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Physically separated

541
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
Meat from animals and you put us on a

542
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,928
And it's not about feeding the pesky 13 year old girl at the dinner table boy who said Mom I'm not going to eat meat anymore

543
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
It's about creating a new form

544
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
What side of the plate

545
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
The people will love

546
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
And they don't have to sacrifice to have it

547
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,656
It in 50 years or a hundred years

548
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
200 years

549
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
We look back on who we are today

550
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,592
And say wow we that was so weird we ate animal meat like we look back on

551
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
On bloodletting or

552
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
You know poor or witchcraft

553
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
So if part of us is always going to do this right. People on

554
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600

555
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Stuff like

556
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
It's just part of who who who we are

557
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
But I think in the main

558
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:35,328
You know it will be viewed as something we used to do and I think more and more it'll be viewed as a

559
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Like when you go to Central Park

560
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912

564
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
I just have no way around in our job

565
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Our obligation

566
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
To make that protein break

567
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
What can I ask you to go out there and have like a baby dog you don't like

568
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Just want to do it

569
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Hardwired

570
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
We have to create me from plan so there's no trade-off in wood

571
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Trying to do that

572
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880

574
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Can you improve it

00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,416
And even believe the little like a cow Burger the bloody stuff actually comes from beat

580
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
