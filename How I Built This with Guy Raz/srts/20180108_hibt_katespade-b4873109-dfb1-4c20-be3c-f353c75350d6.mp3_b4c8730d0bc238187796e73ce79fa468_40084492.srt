Handbags

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
In the world

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
We were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were Andy was funding everything

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
I just I didn't leave you to shut it down I said it's your 401K money

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
And in all of our savings at that point we still weren't seeing you know progression that we've

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Next year in the near future so we thought we had a good run at it we think we've had it

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
From NPR how I built this

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
The person behind the brand Uno is Kate Spade

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Grew up as Kate Brosnahan

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
In Kansas City Missouri

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Then she always loved fashion but

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Never plan to work inside

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
She wanted to be a journalist

40
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
So in the early 1980s

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
She went off to study journalism

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
At Arizona State University

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
And that

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Kate met her future husband

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Andy Spade

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
We work together at a clothing store and I was on when inside he was on the men's side and

47
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
One day his car broke down and he asked me for a ride home and we really started off

48
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Really great friends in the car continue to break down so relationship along

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
And the rest of the story later they're still together anyway

50
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
Kate graduated from college first Andy was a few credits short so she decided to backpack

51
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
You're up by yourself traveled around and came back to New York and

52
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,952
Brentwood temp agency because I desperately needed

53
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Send money

54
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
To be with Andy but that's where my ticket

55
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
It started and ended in New York

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
And

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Got enough money to get back so I needed a job in order to do that so I started it at 10

58
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
Place I was typing and I said I don't think this is going to work out

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
And then she called the next day and said

60
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,904
Can you get ready right now caught in a skulls and they have a job in fashion Department

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,536
So they ended up hiring me they didn't want to because I couldn't type

62
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
My boss

63
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
That she's great and I don't need a side Lot

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
If we were doing fashion shoots and styling so

65
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
It wasn't it

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
What were you what were you doing at

67
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,896
Well I started as an assistant so I was

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Tying

69
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Model shoes

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
On a photoshoot because they couldn't bend over their clothes

71
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
That are getting hair stylist

72
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Snickers

73
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
I'm telling you whatever I Ironton

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Carry bags

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
It was a lot of work

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Say that

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Did you were you Rebecca

78
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
In Tempe at Arizona State University

79
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
I was back in Tempe hours to struggling with a few required courses

80
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
I think I had more

81
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
Credits the necessary but there were a few that I couldn't get through

82
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
But I did start an advertising agency

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
Can see my senior year in college

84
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
And so I

85
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
I started

86
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Trading ads for

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Barding food

88
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
So I'd I go to a restaurant for example and I

89
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
I bring in the ad that they had running in the local paper

90
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,719
And I would show it to them and say I think I can do better if I come back and show you a

91
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
A better version of this

92
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
Will you either pay me in food or give me a few hundred dollars

93
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
I had like 10 takers

94
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
So I ended up with 10 accounts

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
I mean things are going well

96
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
And Kate were you still planning to head

97
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Back to Arizona

98
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
At that point yes

99
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
And I kept saying it when I'm coming back

100
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
I will only stay here

101
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Woofers photostream

102
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Can I move to to sex

103
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
I said I have to be honest

104
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
I kind of like my job

105
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
I loved it and I love the feel of the fast-paced of

106
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
New York and San Leandro

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I loved it

108
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
When she got a job offer for $14,000 a year everything changed

109
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
She's on sting and that's what I

110
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
I'm moving to New York

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
And you just figured

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
I'll find something

113
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,055
Yeah I figured I'd find something there I had a little portfolio

114
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,383
Of advertisements that I'd written and art directed

115
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
So I took that with me to New York and helped

116
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Defining a job

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479

00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951

And

125
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
I remember arriving in

126
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
It's a call me from a pay phone on the corner

127
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
When you arrive

128
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399

What did you start to do there

185
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
It was first assistant

186
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
For the senior fashion editor

187
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
Then I was promoted to associate editor

188
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
And I was in charge of all the accessories

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
And

190
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
Did that for a couple years and they promoted me the senior fashion editor

191
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
And if there's one thing I did learn was

192
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
How to be very resourceful

193
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
And it came in very handy

194
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
We started our business because

195
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
I mean

196
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
That was do not come back to me with

197
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
No

198
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
I mean you

199
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
Figure it out I mean it would be we have to go on a shoot in

200
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
2 days and we need 8 tickets

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Did Muhammad sin

202
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Figure out how to get us all there

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
I mean if we're all on different airplanes I don't care but get us there

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Make it happen

205
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
So I guess it was

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,975
CertiFit the midday early 90s like maybe maybe 1991 when you decided to leave

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Mademoiselle magazine

208
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
What was going on why did you decide to go

209
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
It's funny you know Angie and I were talking one night

210
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
And I just said

211
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
I was looking ahead and

212
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Saw the fashion directory

213
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
I would be your next

214
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Jump from being

215
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Senior fashion editor

216
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
And

217
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
I don't really see myself wanting that

218
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
That job

219
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
So and I are out honestly

220
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Do the Mexican restaurant and

221
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
He just said

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
What about handbag

223
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Honey you just don't start a handbag company

224
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
Resupply not how hard could it be

225
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Okay really

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
He regret those words

227
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
What white handbags

228
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,215
Well she was in accessories editor and she collected

229
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,311
Your handbags for fashion shoots that was one of her key responsibilities

230
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
So she'd have to

231
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Handbags from

232
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Vintage stores

233
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
For Beach shoot straw bag she had a

234
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,039
A Personal Collection that was amazing and then she knew every handbag company in the market

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
I thought you understood it better than anyone

236
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
What's missing in the market

237
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
What was missing

238
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
At the time things for very

239
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
Bags for too complicated

240
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
And I really love very simple kind of architectural shape

241
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
And I would wear these

242
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Very simple shapes

243
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
None of which were

244
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Famous designers names

245
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
If someone wear today

246
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,431
Whose is that I'd say I don't know I bought it at a vintage store or it's a straw bag I got in Mexico

247
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Soaked and they were all very Square in C

248
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Simple I thought

249
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Xiaomi why can't we find something

250
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Just clean and simple and modern

251
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Okay so about 2

252
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
The time that that you want to quit you were thinking

253
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
Like I'm done with fashion magazines

254
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Yes

255
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
And then he was like

256
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
You know bags you know like why don't you try to do this

257
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Design your own

258
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Absolute heat actually set up

259
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Before I quit so I kind of

260
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Already had in the back of my mind and

261
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
I remember at the very beginning

262
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Stay I could have

263
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,943
Made an income while I was working on that since someone said to me

264
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
The truth is

265
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
You would never have done it had you stayed

266
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,903
Because I would have been a scrap yours I mean that it was kind of been out do or die so

267
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
I think if I'd still been working I would have been like

268
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
A little bit more lackadaisical about it words

269
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
When you don't have an income, then you are doing whatever you can to make it happen

270
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
So how did you even start to

271
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
To design handbags me you had no

272
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
Background InDesign you didn't even know what to do in Lakewood

273
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
So things and

274
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,015
Put rivets in at all that stuff it's funny I did not know and I did start

275
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Taipei

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Big sheets of white

277
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Paper

278
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
And I would cut out

279
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Tape honestly

280
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
The shape that I wanted a knife

281
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
Look at it and make it shorter smaller cut it

282
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
And I went to a pattern maker that I found in the back of women's wear daily

283
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
She advertises she made patterns

284
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,799
Should I contact her she worked out of her apartment and she was

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Patient as could be with me

286
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
Because I didn't know anything and I remember being really embarrassed about that

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
That

288
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
I wasn't going to

289
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Student

290
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
From Parsons to RISD or

291
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
Fit that I really didn't know what I was doing

292
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,487
And I honestly started with paper that would make a sample out of any kind of fabric Muslim

293
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
And then

294
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
I kind of got the shape down and I had to find a manufacturer so I called me mister daily they connected me to

295
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Shoe department that they really said we don't do that but someone in the fashion Department said oh it's so hard I know someone

296
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
And he had left himself this

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Production guide to start his own business

298
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,343
So was this guy that you found was he was he a designer manufacturer so he

299
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Did the production

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
And so I brought in my samples and

301
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
He was like okay why wants the money up front and he really was very nervous and I wasn't going to pay him and

302
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
He took our tiny little production honestly which would be

303
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
10 bags of time you know

304
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
And how how long after

305
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Like you

306
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,127
Assertive start to sketch out designs was this was this like

307
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
A few weeks later a month later what what did you

308
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,319
Were you working on this idea for a long time in your apartment yes

309
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
At least a year and you were freelancing

310
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Knight Inn

311
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Certain days a week

312
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
As a stylist

313
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
And

314
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
After getting the

315
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Patterns made

316
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
The next

317
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Big Challenge was finding someone who would sell us

318
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Fabric

319
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Add

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
Because we didn't have any experience none of the fabric houses would sell us anything other than

321
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
A hundred yards for exam

322
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
We only needed to make six packs

323
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
A shape so we only needed probably

324
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
40 yards

325
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
30 RND 25

326
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
So I called

327
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
I looked in the Yellow Pages

328
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
And I looked up

329
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Burlap

330
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Potato sack

331
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
That's

332
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Who's willing to sell to

333
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Three different

334
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
No wait

335
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
And I needed the heaviest weight

336
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Substantial enough

337
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Bram.

338
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
That was actually our first collection

339
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
Made out of burlap made out of burlap

340
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
So what is the bags look like they were imagine

341
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Brown burlap

342
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Kind of rectangular little bag

343
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
Yes absolutely with Raffia Fringe

344
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
And

345
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
Webbing handle and I found a wedding company also

346
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
In the Yellow Pages

347
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
I see you get this

348
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
You get these samples and then what you

349
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
How do you get

350
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
How do you start with the first thing you do

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
You go to these

352
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Accessory shows

353
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Treacherous

354
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
Trade shows and you get to get accepted

355
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
And we did and

356
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
The question is

357
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
You get the worst spot because all the famous

358
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
People end up in the front seat in New York

359
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
In New York

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
This is the first

361
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
Trade show you went to debut the Kate Spade

362
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135

00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Back yes

364
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
We honest-to-god brought in our own tables

365
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Lounge chairs

366
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Tiffany lamps

367
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Come on apartment apartment actually turn into our partner

368
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
For the week

369
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,311
Nervous I mean Kate were you like I don't know where that were you worried that maybe somebody from

370
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Honey mask

371
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
See you in a few a little embarrassed or

372
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,247
Somebody was her call you out and say what are you doing who you guys were you where you get asked me out

373
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
I was I

374
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
Because the editors come by as well as the buyers

375
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
To the trade shows

376
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
And I really didn't tell my parents

377
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Or my family about it

378
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Or anyone for that matter

379
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
Because I thought if it doesn't work

380
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
I will be so

381
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Embarrassed

382
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Because everyone kept saying

383
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Why would you have quit your job

384
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
You had insurance but you know who do you think you are I just knew my family with just

385
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
Oh you got a little hot-headed big headed there in New York and

386
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Think you can start this company

387
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
So I kept it on the down low

388
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
They talk about it watch 2

389
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Family

390
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
Because I think secretly bug thought it would fail

391
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
How did people respond to the bag

392
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
It well

393
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,399
I remember crying because when I came home we hadn't even sold enough to cover the cost of the booth

394
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
And I started crying and annies

395
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Who did you get and I said

396
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
What we got

397
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Barney's

398
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
And he's a

399
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
Okay and I said

400
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Fred Segal in Los Angeles news

401
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
Brahe to the news

402
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Migas

403
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Katie

404
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
To the best stores in America

405
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Why are you crying I said I think we should shut it down

406
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
I'm very cool

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
I have no interest in losing money

408
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
I said and we've been out we've already spent

409
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
$4,000 and that that's it for me I'm not a gambler

410
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
So that's her and he was like that

411
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Keep going

412
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
And also have to get a great deal of credit

413
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
To the editors

414
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
The time we were

415
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Tell me the lot but the editors

416
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
We're putting this into magazine

417
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,967
A lot what was it about your bags at appeal to them

418
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
I did because it wasn't anything anyone was doing and everyone there's a fabric show in Paris called premiere

419
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Busy on the all the designers go to

420
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
Sometimes you could end up with the same

421
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Materials

422
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
Mine came out of the Yellow Pages chances are I wasn't going to run into any people that have the same material

423
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,775
So we were doing something different which was really to our advantage

424
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
Two editors for like

425
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Beautiful burlap bags

426
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
They thought they were

427
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,015
Beautiful tiny they thought they were interested and

428
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,599
We did we got a lot of credits then that's when my mother first found out

429
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
And she was embarrassed and she called

430
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Embarrassing that you didn't

431
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Tell me and my friend had to tell me I said

432
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
I know I don't know I don't wanna make a big deal of this and

433
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
It okay it's one credit that's not a business

434
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
How did you come up

435
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
How did you serve land on the name

436
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Well that was an

437
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Because we weren't I was not Kate

438
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Spade I was

439
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Kate Brosnahan and

440
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
I kept coming up with these names

441
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Kate

442
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
Stay because we were 50-50 partners

443
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
Finally I just said okay then once I'd love it

444
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Kate Spade do you work and I remember telling

445
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023

In flames

449
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
But you're not keep say that I said I know but she's a

450
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:22,847
Oh now you'll never be Kate Spade now you've been jinxed it and why would you name it Kate Spade and I said

I'm gonna rise

494
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,951
Soap when Kate and Edith debut the original Kate Spade bag

495
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
They got orders from

496
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Barney's

497
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Fred Segal

498
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
And it was a big deal in the world of fashion

499
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Even with those orders

500
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
It didn't mean Caton and E were suddenly flush

501
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
With cash or living large in New York

502
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Wasn't going to guarantee that the

503
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Company was going to be successful

504
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359

00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
Paying the overhead yeah I'm basically the Rams and the other expenses right we'll keep freelancing that started the company

507
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,415
And I just thought what we're both 29 30 years old and

508
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
It's time to do it we don't have children

Let's not quit even if we

510
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Lose everything

511
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,607
Kate can always go back to Fashion job

512
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
You know I can

513
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Continue working advertising

514
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
And you guys are running the company

515
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Apartments

516
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
We'd move to a loft

517
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,383
Tribeca because we were in a small apartment then we move to

518
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431

519
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479

Crawl up

522
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343

Very well fit.

526
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
It really was that we were still

You could take the train

532
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704

533
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240

540
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,696
Excited put the orders would not be that big because it was hard to

541
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,816
The people that time to cut once they started selling then you get bigger order so it was really

542
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
Very gradual I mean it was at least

543
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
3 years

544
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424

In the first year two

554
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Fat women walking around New York with

555
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
I did

556
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Most of whom

557
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,048
We redditors who are getting them a very good discounts

558
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
But eventually we started to see it and I remember thinking

559
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,680
When I did that was a big deal

560
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
And

561
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,800
You know I think it took people while even my family my sister was working

562
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
Bucheon actually

563
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Called me and said we're all pitching in

564
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
Mom

565
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Mother's Day

566
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Get her Gucci bag and I thought

567
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
What

568
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,160
Because I really didn't think

569
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
It would be much

570
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
I still should be upset with him about that hopefully they're listening

571
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,912
Show all the while you're sleeping bags out you're getting orders in and you are still designing

572
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Facts

573
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Yes

574
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
So you're working like

575
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Crazy

576
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
We are and

577
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
What we ended up doing

578
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
What's Peter Kahn

579
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Two partners

580
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
For Sweat Equity only

581
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
It was supplied by the way

582
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Terrence my best friend

583
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
That was 80

584
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Someone that we just met

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Define seer in New York

586
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
So

587
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,976
The three of us were in cars going to the factories

588
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
I was really doing the design the only the

589
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Didn't I also noticed

590
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
Steam in the bag box and packing

591
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
And how are you guys funding

592
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Was always around

593
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Yeah I got a job offer to work

594
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,848
For Saatchi & Saatchi in LA and I almost tripled my salary

595
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
Yeah we're still funding the company ourselves

596
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
And we needed money

597
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
For fabric and we needed money

598
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
The trade shows

599
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,600
Until we both agreed that I would go to La you did move to LA

600
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
I thought I could go back

601
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Bedford Hotel New York

602
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
Partner with you

603
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,656
FedEx in all my designs and materials than a regular house that I called the house I never lived in

604
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
I never bought a piece of furniture

605
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
And I just took the money and send it to me I'll put it back into the business

606
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
Did you ever get a point in in the first two years

607
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Where you thought this was going to collapse if the

608
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Yes and I remember calling back

609
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
Talesun Pamela New York Mason

610
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
I didn't leave you two

611
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Shut it down I said it's what wow are you guys

612
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Like in data

613
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
It was hard I mean it was we were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were and he was funding everything

614
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,912
And at that point we were all kind of putting money in family would put into Emeli Sande

615
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
I just remembered thinking up again it's like

616
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
We run to your 401K money

617
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
And in all of our savings at that point

618
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
We still weren't seeing

619
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
You know progression that would go to pay the salary that I

620
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
Year in the near future

621
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
A good run at it

622
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
I think we called the partners who

623
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
We brought in as as

624
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
Equity Partners on a handshake without any salary and we said we think we've had it

625
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Exhausted

626
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Leftist art

627
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
With you and we haven't returned the deals.

628
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,592
Not working it's a we felt like you can't just walk out and I remember we spoken

629
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,944
We're going to go back

630
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
I'm trying to make

631
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
9595 96-95 probably 95 and I did get another job

632
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
New York a great job actually

633
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
And so

634
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
But still the company was not making money

635
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
What was the what what happen

636
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
I would say the stores really

637
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Started to buy more we were in sacks

638
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Bethany Menzel

639
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
When the

640
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Large department stores started to buy

641
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
It

642
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Kind of really took off and

643
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
We won

644
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
The cfda awards which is

645
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
The Capitol Fax

646
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Designers of America

647
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
And

648
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
There were reporters from around the country not just

649
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
New York at the show that were saying

650
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Who is this

651
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
So that really really

652
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Help us a great deal I have

653
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
How's the word that

654
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Your smile designers

655
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,216
Didn't win at the time that was usually a Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein Donna

656
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Karen all this be

657
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
And I remember Kate when we came back to New York and we were hoping

658
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Think something would happen

659
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
Either Neiman's are stacks

660
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,736
They're buying for two or three stores and they said we're going to buy for all of our stores

661
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
And that was

662
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
50 stores

663
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
More Than Words

664
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
And that quadruple our business

665
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
But what you have to realize his

666
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
When that happens although it's very good you also have to upfront

667
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Pay for the production they don't pay you for

668
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
30 to 6 today so I remembered

669
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
Are we going to afford this but we

670
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
Never borrow a dime

671
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Ever

672
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Was there something that you guys did like a business

673
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Decision that you

674
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
You made

675
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
That

676
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
That was the

677
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
The key to turning this around or was it just

678
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
More people started

679
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,552
Covered in you just you just persevered through those rough years and then it's

680
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Finally just kind of on its own

681
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Ghetto

682
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Got discovered

683
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
That's exactly what happened I mean it really was just

684
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
Kind of a little bit of a Snowball Effect

685
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
No just got a little bigger and a little bigger and bigger and

686
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
I think

687
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,008
We're the largest department stores we're picking us up

688
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
I think that it will be realized

689
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
Getting larger and larger spaces in stores which is very important

690
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
At first you wanted honey little table

691
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
And maybe get a few

692
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Basin shelves in the next

693
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
Stores to shop and Shop is what they call them where your name is above it really big

694
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Seizure to talking to

695
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,008
I think it's more fun for my mom actually but it was a lot of fun I have to stay in the

696
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
Opening of stores do you know we'd open the store

697
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
And Soho tiny little 300 square-foot

698
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Pet store the next day

699
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
You know we're opening a bigger store in New York

700
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
And then we're opening in

701
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Los Angeles

702
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Westin Chicago

703
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
It was kind of

704
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
At that point it became a little dizzy and

705
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
A bit of a whirlwind

706
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Thought it was fun

707
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
And so some point you guys sold at

708
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Part of the company

709
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
That was at the service scale up or

710
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Like to make it even bigger

711
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
You know it was also a safety that quite honestly

712
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Lee Brice personally

713
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
And it was Neiman Marcus and we thought that would be somebody that would

714
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
Be in a position to help us

715
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
And they bought

716
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
More than 50

717
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
Keepers of the company that they bought 56

718
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
And reportedly for more than 30 million dollars was that

719
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,696
And same to you guys went with when it was they were I think our biggest

720
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Quieter

721
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Restore the time and

722
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
We're doing very well with them and they just started

723
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Investigate other little little brands that

724
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
They thought I had potential

725
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
And yeah they came to us we were

726
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Completely

727
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
In shock

728
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Is exciting because

729
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Cuz we thought wow

730
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
Which everything goes goes away tomorrow

731
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
You know it will be able

732
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
Sustained

733
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
I mean it was really about not being able to have

734
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
A bit of an essay going forward

735
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
The four of us

736
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
I know what it mean when winning in Marcus by

737
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
More than half of the change

738
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Kate Spade

739
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
We started going into more categories because they were

740
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Encouraging that which a lot of the stores not too

741
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Mancino's Zach all of them work

742
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Really encouraging us

743
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
2

744
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
Categories

745
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Stationary next

746
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,056
Switch that was right when the phones and emails and all that were

747
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Replacing p

748
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
People writing notes

749
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
Texas native

750
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Another category we didn't mean

751
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
Dying category

752
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
So I think what they were and flying

753
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
Shoes they really wanted some

754
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Real substantial

755
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
Second categories are third fourth

756
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
So then we started doing shoes and

757
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
It really just started

758
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
No I think it was just a good boost

759
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
And I mean you guys probably had to go from you and Andy and your two

760
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Two partners II

761
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Mexican place

762
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
We did but we have done that actually

763
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
In the process

764
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Slowly slowly changing

765
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
Offices and we take a floor and then

766
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
We take another floor in the building

767
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,856
Started hiring people hiring Department in different departments in production

768
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Can people in

769
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
And then hiring people that

770
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Have more experience

771
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,488
So I really had a lot of people around

772
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
And Andy did Andy really surrounded himself

773
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Really

774
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Greats

775
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Art Department

776
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
And I really had great designers with me and

777
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
I think we really developed

778
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Employees that were amazing

779
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
When did you start to see

780
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Kate Spade bags

781
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
All over the place

782
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Huge iconic

783
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
And when did you first kind of realize

784
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
I'd say was about

785
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
97

786
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
It was still

787
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Ferry New York though I must say

788
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
There a New York Los Angeles Chicago

789
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,584
I think it was about 98 or

790
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
90 / UTM

791
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
Did any city that you went to

792
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Counterfeit start

793
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
That was about

794
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Which Andy said that's actually a comp

795
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Something right when

796
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,760
They're on baby blanket on every street in order to be celebrated for a day and then the next day that was over

797
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,416
You guys sold the rest of your your share of

798
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,256
2007

799
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Walked away from it

800
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Why'd you decide to do that

801
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
So

802
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
We

803
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Panda baby

804
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
In 2005 and I just wanted to

805
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
It was a perfect opportunity

806
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
The point was it

807
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Neiman Marcus

808
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Set the time

809
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
Was selling

810
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Themselves

811
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
To text

812
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Pacific

813
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Paintball Des

814
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Get them a lot of credit for that

815
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
But when we saw them everything

816
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Keynote

817
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Kind of like we have a

818
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
I bought some music I want to leave on

819
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
On good terms if it's a

820
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Perfect time to leave

821
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
I wanted to spend time with my daughter

822
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
It was

823
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
You've heard so many horror stories

824
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,704
About people who style and then they stay and then they fighting and they sue and

825
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
That's too ugly

826
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
Before me so

827
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,128
We left on great terms we stay because of turnover

828
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
For a year I think

829
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,504
For that transition to make sure all the employees who we loved had

830
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Had agreement

831
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
The carry-on

832
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
And I'll make sure it was understood

833
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
The process was

834
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
And

835
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
They were very gracious and I think we all handle it very well

836
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
It was seamless

837
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
It was a very

838
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,144
Quiet exit

839
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
You guys obviously have the same

840
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Incredibly strong

841
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,360
Marriage meme email heera college students are still together you have a

842
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,456
You created this big amazing brand and how do you

843
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,552
How do you have a marriage and a business and make it work

844
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
I mean

845
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,696
Safe from my perspective I remember people saying how do you work together when I was thrilled

846
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
I don't wait up wait up and I'm not ready yet means

847
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,632
Let me tell you right now if you think that everyday

848
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,752
Office together we can have lunch together

849
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
We actually work on separate floors

850
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
For that very reason because

851
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
Keep you on the phone and Isaac

852
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
Get off the phone I have something to tell you or ask you

853
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
And that we had to really I had to myself

854
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Find boundaries in

855
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
We had to make

856
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
Conscious effort not to talk about it 24/7 which is

857
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,512
As you can tell by how quickly I talk like tendency

858
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
And I also am very

859
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
A nervous person I worry a lot

860
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,472
A nanny could not be more different sleepless nights

861
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Always another

862
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
The sky is falling

863
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
You know it's good it's fine because we

864
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
We kind of grew up together

865
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
20s

866
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Up until now in AR-15

867
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
And we actually have a lot in common with help

868
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
You guys

869
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Recently

870
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Launch a new company

871
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:13,888
Together we could you call it by Frances Valentine in case you changed your name from Kate Spade

872
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,752
To keep Valentine I did but I added it I didn't change it I just added

873
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Francis

874
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Valentine into it so it's very

875
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
It's Katherine

876
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
No

877
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Francis

878
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Valentine

879
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Brosnahan Spade

880
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Eddie Long

881
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
Did you do it in part because

882
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Kate Spade and become

883
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Its own singing

884
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
Beyond a single person

885
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,024
Yes and I thought it was important to make sure that we weren't stepping on any toes and

886
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
That we distinguished

887
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Our company

888
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
And I think that was important

889
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
For both of us

890
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,704
I mean people still call me Kate Spade I go buy it

891
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Seitz eye

892
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,824
Myself so you can call me Francis if you want

893
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
Tell me about Frances Valentine

894
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
We are doing

895
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Shoes and Handbags

896
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
So we actually when we started

897
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
It was

898
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Initially just

899
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Shoes

900
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Until there we go

901
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,952
I'm not your just your little over a year

902
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
But we realized that

903
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
People expecting bags

904
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
I and I mean now you're different

905
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
The hunger is

906
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
I'm sure it's still there but

907
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
It's not like a do-or-die

908
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Sing like a

909
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
It must be that I don't know

910
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Is it less stressful

911
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,200
We've air conditioning I think that's think that's a big difference right elevators and air conditioning

912
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
I would stay there

913
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
It's

914
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
But I feel a little more confident

915
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
I think Andy feels the same because we've done it before

916
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
But on the same hand

917
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Do you think that

918
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
People are expecting a great deal

919
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
So they're still there still a lot of pressure Trestman

920
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Personal finance

921
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Again so

922
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
I'm not crazy that as I mentioned earlier

923
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Losing any money

924
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
You know this thing go to work

925

And my daughter kind of kept nudging me to his died for me to say something

945
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744

I know for how you built that

968
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Update story of how Dennis Darnell solve a problem we can probably

969
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,856
Bubbly all relate to when I used to get home you can come in the house

970
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,976
And there'd be that one fly flying around you have no idea how it got in there but it's flying around at the buccaneer

971
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
I think we can all relate to that problem

972
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,144
One summer day in San Diego where Dennis lives

973
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Joyland

974
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
We're sitting in the kitchen and they were watching him

975
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,312
Fly Buzz all around we sat there and watched it

976
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Trying to get into the garbage can

977
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
And what if I said

978
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
Why do I drill a hole in the lid

979
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
And let it in

980
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
But put a trap

981
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
On the underside of the lid

982
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
And that is how the garbage can

983
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Fly trap

984
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
Was born flies

985
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Of course love

986
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Garbage

987
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
Soap Dennis designs trap where

988
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
Drill a hole in the lid of your garbage can

989
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
Then you pop in this little

990
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
Plastic doorway for the fly

991
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
But there's also a second part which is the cartridge

992
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
Which is lined with flypaper

993
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,824
And so why the fly thinks it's going down into the garbage can

994
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
It actually walks into the Disposable cartridge

995
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
And because

996
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Stuck cartridge gets

997
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Full with like a hundred flies

998
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
You don't have to look at that more touch anything sticky or gross

999
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,648
Stand just push the button on the lid

1000
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:30,048
And the cartridge falls into the garbage can that's Dennis turn out since we first spoke to him

1001
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
A year ago he started selling his products on Amazon are still selling the original fly traps

1002
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,824
Spell Dennis has their best selling product is a pet waste bin that comes

1003
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
With a fly trap

1004
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:48,736
