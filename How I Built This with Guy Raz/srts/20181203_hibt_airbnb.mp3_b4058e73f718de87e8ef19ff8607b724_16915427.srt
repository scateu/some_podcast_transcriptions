Hate this guy here today we got another brand new episode from the house

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,176
Built this Summit in San Francisco that happened this past October

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
This one is for my live interview with Joe gebbia the co-founder of Airbnb

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,184
October of 2016 for one of our very first episode

20
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:06,048
And you haven't heard about the wild rollercoaster ride of starting Airbnb

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
You should definitely go back and get that episode of listen

22
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Because Jonah co-founders they really went through major changes and pivots and disappointment

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Send failure

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
Before they hit on the idea that today

25
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
We all recognize one of the most iconic travel brands in the world so when I sat down with Joe Bacci

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
October

27
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
I want to spend time talking with him about why they never gave up

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Even when lots of people were saying

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
That idea

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,816
Was never going to work

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
Joe

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Guy

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
It is

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
It is actually amazing a 10 years ago

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,336
No one in this room no one listening no one in the world

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,200
Imagine that people will be sleeping at the homes of random strangers

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Soap

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Let's start with the idea

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
The beginning of Airbnb go back to 2008

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Really at this point

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
Nobody wants to invest in this business

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Does Hugo

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
If you remember the podcast

44
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
They email 20 investors

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
10 replied 5 coffee with them none invest

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
I mean I'm not surprised

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
The time people are telling you

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
This is a stupid idea and it's not going to work

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Right because that's what you were hearing

50
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,152
We got that I can tell you all the times and show you all the emails from

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
I'm really credible investors like people that

52
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Disturb investors that picked

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,624
Google and PayPal and YouTube and Facebook and all of the kind of Internet Grace that came before us

54
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
And so

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Sitting there offices you know

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
It was just demoralizing

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
To be

58
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Sitting across from somebody who has

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,912
A good Instinct for a good idea paint lead based on their portfolio

60
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
And to look at you in just say

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
This is never going to work

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Or

63
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
There's one investor that will go unnamed who said

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
You should really focus on Church groups

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,016
And then he said but you know what church groups aren't a big it's not a big market so I'm going to pass on this

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Cuz he couldn't get over the hump of

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
How could you possibly

68
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Build a company that's based on Strangers

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Posting pictures

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Of the most intimate

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Parts of their home there

72
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Bedroom Gallery kitchen or bathroom

73
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
On the internet

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
If you are going to pay to come stay in their home yeah

75
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
That's going to be big

76
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
But in their defense Joe like

77
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
I think

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
Most of us in this room probably would have

79
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Agreed to send 10 years ago I mean I think that

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
It was a weird idea

81
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
It was so weird that was kind of a

82
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Dom ideas

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
4053 North

84
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Westport outside

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
I mean

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
People were probably sing that you over and over again like this is just

87
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
Like move on do try something else

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Is that was it happening that was actually happening in

89
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,544
You know the truth is if you made decisions based on what a spreadsheet tells you

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Are spreadsheets said

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
This is not going to work

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Get a job or start something else

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
Like it was highly irrational to keep going with their product

94
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
And I'll never forget when we went home by Bryan my co-founder and I

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
He went back to Upstate New York coming back to Georgia

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
So the holiday been home for Christmas

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,768
2007 you go home for the holidays and what do people ask

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
What are you up to what are you doing

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
How's your day going for you and so

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
You know neither of us really had a lot to say about the year except this one time and people say no

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
Our apartment design conference

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
And

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
One of two things happened like

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
People eat with either way

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Oh my God

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Tell me more

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
This is really interesting

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Piedmont ohmygod

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
You're insane

110
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Yeah and they would leave the conversation

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,391
And there's something about that visceral reaction that it got out of people

112
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
We're Brian and I were like

113
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Maybe there's something here maybe this is there's there's more this to me thinking

114
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
There were enough people to wanted to hear more about it that said yeah I tried like that or

115
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
Noah Nelson college of us through your travel through Europe and you know I get off the train station or not

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
I want to be standing there is a pension with a sign we don't stay in her place

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
So people started telling stories about actually you know

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
People are already traveling this way it's just not

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Formalize

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
It's not easy

121
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Yeah smart people

122
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
That you respect

123
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Tell you you're wrong

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Tell you your idea is bad

125
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
When do you know that there are

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
Did you think they were wrong or did a part of you think

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Maybe they're right

128
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
This is the part where in your head is an entrepreneur you go a little bit crazy

129
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
Because you bounce back and forth between like

130
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
Wow that's a really smart person they said this idea sucks

131
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
And then you go home you're like no

132
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
I'm sticking with this I'm going to make this happen

133
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Like they can't tell me this is wrong

134
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
And

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
I think

136
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Maybe it's a personality trait

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
For me

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
You know that kind of stuff actually fuels me

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Yeah that there were times at

140
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Study design at RISD where

141
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Professors would tell me something couldn't get done

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
And that was all I needed.

143
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
I mean

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
In this because

145
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,727
Not everyone's wired that way in and maybe you you aren't either maybe sometimes

146
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
You were

147
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
You did kind of give up

148
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,127
Will actor hear something very important to know about our story

149
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Is that

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,735
If you look at Airbnb from 2008 onward

151
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
You're missing

152
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
A big chunk that took place before Airbnb

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
Because I've worked on a lot of ideas that were really bad

154
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
You just haven't heard of them cuz they never went anywhere

155
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
And so

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
I think it really takes

157
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Eugene

158
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
What I would say in the gym of Entrepreneurship

159
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
Were you just trying things and it doesn't matter if it pans out or not it's about

160
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Going through the process

161
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
I was at working on the street here at Chronicle Books as a book designer

162
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
University. San Francisco

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
And

164
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
Every dad leave and

165
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
In the room right where I was the exit was there was a Giants industrial size trash can is gray big trash

166
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Afghans overflowing is white books

167
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
One day when I can pick up the books and discover their completely blank

168
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,655
And I went to my manager at the time I said hey what's going on at these books Gozo those are the proof books they do before they make

169
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
A big running back of a book

170
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
I said all the trash

171
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
I have them

172
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Sure

173
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
What's the deal with me really weird like what do you want trash

174
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,711
I was like these are perfect just like sketchbooks or journals or other things

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,063
So actually co-opted these books I throw my bag in for like a year and a half

176
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
I didn't gather these books I have a $2,000 books

177
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
In my garage

178
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Down the street

179
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:32,607
Did I collect in the cool thing is everyone is different notes you're exactly the same and I came with the rubber stamp I give it a brand

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
I sold them online I saw them design fairs

181
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
And I

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Yeah

183
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Have a silly idea if

184
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Didn't go anywhere

185
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
But it was just like

186
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
But you see something and you do something about it

187
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Yeah

188
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,271
I mean so we we've done an episode was about Slack

189
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Stewart Butterfield who's actually here and in the audience

190
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
S&M

191
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
Really the story of slack is a story of

192
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
A completely different idea it was supposed to be a game company

193
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Uglich

194
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
And that

195
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
That didn't work didn't work out with a beautifully designed

196
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
They kept out of the capital and they kept pushing forward but eventually

197
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
They had to give it up

198
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
And that was it was that was going to be before the end of the story and slack was kind of an accident because it was his intro message

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Charging system that they

200
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Created

201
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
Just so the engineers could talk to the marketing people and

202
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,623
It was this amazing serendipitous pivot

203
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
How did you

204
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
How did you guys know

205
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
That you should just keep pushing forward was it where you talking about this

206
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
Was was Brian sang with we got to keep pushing forward you saying it figures

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Where I go to when I think of that question

208
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
We had an experience that those investors did

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
We had three people stay in her home

210
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,127
We for 5 days we knew exactly what that felt like

211
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
It was magical

212
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
I'm getting to Shogun San Francisco getting to

213
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Like really go from strangers to friends but in such a short Arc

214
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
The time

215
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Russ was like really inspiring and

216
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
And one thing you just reminded me of is

217
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
A piece of advice that Paul Graham who started y combinator

218
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
I'm gave us and gives all the startups

219
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Is very simple

220
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
In a startup

221
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Do one thing

222
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Don't die

223
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Keep going

224
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Just figure out a way to keep going I think your story about

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
Stuart is so on point because it's just like Heat going you don't know like

226
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
What

227
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Yuan cover or what

228
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Other idea you'll stumble onto

229
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
Idfc if you haven't tried A and B 4

230
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
If you get off on a forget about it

231
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
But an end

232
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,511
Be mindful of a folks in this audience who are early-stage entrepreneurs

233
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
There are times when

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,423
It's better to kind of packet in or pivot or give up on

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,007
That idea and accept the failure and move on right

236
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Yes probably

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
I think it's also worth

238
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Remembering that

239
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
The way that our service started

240
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
We thought the big Grand idea

241
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
Wizz Air Beds For conferences

242
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
And we actually start it was very laughable thank you

243
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
We thought that

244
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
We were going to be at an event website where conference is it sold out

245
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
People can inflate an air bed in their living room

246
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
And that was the big idea so

247
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Our next iteration

248
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
For South by Southwest in 2008 was literally conference website

249
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
After the dove that launched

250
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
We regrouped

251
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
And listen to people's feedback and only wants to give the DNC

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
And that flopped

253
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Let me watch the fourth time a year after that

254
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
And that's where the numbers finally started to click the product Market actually had a fit

255
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
And so

256
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
I think the important part there is a

257
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
We were constantly listening iterating

258
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
We got wrong four times

259
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
In a row

260
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,239
The good news though is that you can watch and it's a dud you can watch it again because nobody knew about the first one so

261
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Today is not easy

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
It was easy more people would do it

263
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
So like their tastes like

264
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Psychological

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Strength

266
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
To stick with it

267
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
Even when there's no hope in sight and when spreadsheets tell you to do something else

268
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
But is that an inherent

269
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Quality or is that something that can be learned

270
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
I think an absolute be learned

271
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
My experience

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
I've looked back in my life I've seen I've ever has a pattern

273
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
That whenever I've been

274
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Uncomfortable with something

275
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
I-10 not all the time but I tend

276
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
2

277
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
See that as an invitation to engage in

278
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
So freaking sample

279
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,367
I was reminded recently was back on rizzi's campus a couple weeks ago for a one-night weekend

280
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
And I was

281
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Why can't I campus I remembered that

282
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
How uncomfortable I was public speaking

283
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
At that time in my life

284
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Could not get in front of audience I was terrified sweaty

285
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
Palms of a nervous shaking car

286
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
A common feeling

287
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,031
Totally right on and I knew that about myself and so I purposefully signed up

288
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
To be a tour guide on campus

289
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
Because I knew it would force me to be in front of people and 1/2 Bossier therapy some

290
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
I didn't know that

291
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Okay

292
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
So I think that's one of the

293
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,767
See what you would force yourself to confront things that you weren't comfortable with and that's sort of how you practiced

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
This this kind of always do that

295
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
There are times where

296
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,727
There's something in front of Mike I don't want to do that I want to talk to a person I'm nervous and intimidated

297
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
They're more important me that about like whatever the excuses that goes on your brain yeah

298
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Like

299
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
I think an entrepreneur can reframe those things sake

300
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Opportunity

301
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Yeah

302
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
You really describe the

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Emotional rollercoaster

304
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
Of of doing this and in something that

305
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
So many founders

306
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,839
Experience and just kind of grind through it even even if it's difficult to put this in context for everybody so

307
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Over the years

308
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Restart you do everything

309
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
So what do we do every goal in the company

310
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
I remember the earliest days

311
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Realize

312
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,663
He already has our service and we probably need a number for them to call if there's a problem

313
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Enable

314
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Last minute decision

315
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
I threw my number up on the website

316
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
As customer service

317
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
And I

318
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,207
My phone almost immediately started ringing

319
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
I'm from that point for the next probably

320
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Gosh I don't know what year and a half

321
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
I was very closely associated customer service

322
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
Eventually we hired a team

323
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
And they took it over and I got to

324
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Get out of little bit

325
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
But the people would call like in the middle of the night

326
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
Hey I'm trying to check into my place in Berlin and

327
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,831
I can't find the host how do I get the keys and I have to like go scramble get to put my laptop with their account like

328
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
Like 3 in the morning in San Francisco

329
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
Just remind another story where

330
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
I'm about to go to bed at 11 tonight I am just so tired

331
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
And we're still working at her apartment at this point

332
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
And I'm about to turn the computer off

333
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
And I got houses check the Gmail inbox one more time

334
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,079
I'm about to close it out I hit refresh and sure enough right of the top there's a big bold black

335
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Email

336
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Subject line

337
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,271
But this is like help with like 12! Voice I click on it sure enough

338
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
It's this couple young couple in their 20s

339
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Checking into the marina

340
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Here in San Francisco there's summer in the marina there lost their host isn't answering the phone or phone doesn't work they found wife at a cafe near

341
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Nearby

342
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
They said

343
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Standing at this intersection

344
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
Of like Laguna and something

345
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
And so

346
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
I just

347
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Jumping my Jeep

348
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
And I drive to the intersection

349
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
It's at night

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
It's 11 it's dark

351
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Dena street lights

352
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
I'm driving slow with headlights on

353
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
And sure enough

354
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
On the corner

355
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
I see a couple of it

356
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
You know the big roller bags

357
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Oh my God I have a scarf in like

358
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
I just like

359
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
That's them

360
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
So I pull up in a window

361
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,655
And heading out The Meadows coming so it wasn't like this random guy in a car

362
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
I said hey it's Joe I'm here I made it

363
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
And

364
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm at this point I'm like

365
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
When you get the car will find a place for you but I had no option

366
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
To take them to I'm just like

367
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
We're going to make this up as we go here

368
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
And so

369
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,879
We start driving back to our apartment and I'm talking to how was your trip really sorry about this

370
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
We'll get to the bottom of it don't worry

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
And

372
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
As I'm driving back

373
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
I realize there's a

374
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,375
I friend-zoned apartment below as an extra bedroom cuz room had moved in yet

375
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
The only thing is it wasn't furnished

376
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
I think I myself okay I've got a room

377
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
How do I get it furnished

378
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,639
The clock is ticking here we're almost back to the apartment they think I have a solution for them but I don't

379
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
And

380
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,575
I get them in the apartment I take bring up the living room in like a beverage of some kind

381
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
And it said just hang here for a minute I'll get the room ready for you

382
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927

383
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
I Blitz down the hall

384
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
And

385
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
I ripped the bed sheets off my bed

386
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
And I grabbed my mattress

387
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655

388
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727

389
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823

390
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
