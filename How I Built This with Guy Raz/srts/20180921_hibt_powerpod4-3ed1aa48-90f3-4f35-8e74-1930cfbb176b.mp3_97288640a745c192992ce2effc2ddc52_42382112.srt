You know I usually get to ask

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,528

Last year

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
I hope you enjoy it

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
I have to tell you that the biggest hits

19
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
That I had in my life ending music and hunting television and heading business

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
I have been always as a result of significant projections

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
And the repeated rejections so every time I have an idea that people tell me no don't do it

22
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
From NPR

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
How I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist stories behind the movements

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
A group of a spandex wearing teenage superheroes called the Power Rangers help turn Haim Saban

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
One of the richest man on earth

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
If you ask the Haim Saban what he does

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
I used to describe myself as a cartoon schleper

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Cartoon flapper

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Yep

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
What I did for years is I

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Went and knocked on doors on

32
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Try to sell

33
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Cartoons

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
All over the world

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
That's what a slapper does

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,792
And he slept some of the biggest cartoons of the 80s

37
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
The 90s

38
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Inspector Gadget

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
X-Men and of course

40
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
His biggest hit

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
The Mighty Morphin Power Ranger

42
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,032
Which has just been revived is a blockbuster Hollywood feature

43
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
Kids found a spaceship buried underground

44
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero

45
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
But we're getting ahead of ourselves here because long before the Power Rangers long before

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
Haim Saban was flying around the world on a

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Private jet charter

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
Hangouts Beverly Hills mansion with Bill Clinton

49
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,352
He was just a poor Jewish kid living on a Dusty Street

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
In Alexandria Egypt

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
We lived in

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
Very narrow Street

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
We were kind of

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
Lower class

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,224
Family my father was a Salesman in a toy store and my mother was a seamstress

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
We had

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,880
Family friends were Egyptian Muslims Egyptian Christians

58
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
Greeks Italians

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
It wasn't pretty Cosmopolitan city Alexandria in 1956 shortly after

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
The Suez War many Egyptian Jews were accused of being traitors so I'm Stanley had to flee.

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Israel Highway 12 at the time and no one in his family spoke in Hebrew in fact they didn't know

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Anyone in Israel and when they got there they were housed in a tiny apartment in a rough part of Tel Aviv

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
It was one room in an apartment that had three rooms and the other two rooms

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,048
Who are occupied by another couple and by

65
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
A hooker and her pimp

66
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
And it was the five of us

67
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
And

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
My father basically had a job

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
Selling pencils and erasers

70
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Door to door

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
And some days you would tell three pencils and some days

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
No pencil

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
To say the least a very hard

74
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Life yes

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
And do you remember

76
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Going to school right away

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Well I didn't want to go to school but my father thought I should be a lawyer

78
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
I mean I I wanted to make money you know because

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
Living under these conditions was not

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Avairy

81
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Exciting prospect

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
That's all

83
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
We compromised that I would

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Work during the day

85
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
Study

86
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
At night

87
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
So

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I'd wake up at 6 I go to

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,087
Be a runner in travel agency

90
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,183
4:30 the afternoon not go to school until 9:30

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
Antonia come home I do my homework

92
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
In the staircase

93
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Because obviously I couldn't do it

94
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
In the room

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
The family was

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
And

97
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Go to sleep and then

98
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
Everyday was the same routine

99
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
What were you a good student

100
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
I was a pretty bad student

101
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
And

102
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
The principal called my father and said

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,831
Your son most probably is going to make a lot of money one day but

104
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
A student and academic she ain't going to be any ain't going to be no lawyer so take him out of school so my father

105
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Father sat me down and said

106
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
I need you

107
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
To finish

108
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
High School

109
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
I'm finished with high-grade

110
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
And then you can do whatever you want

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
But you must finish High

112
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
And did you finish with high grades

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Yes

114
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Did you feel in any way

115
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Being a Jew

116
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
From an Arab can

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Free in Israel

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
The time

119
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
That

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
I know you were you were

121
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Racine assertive

122
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Lower

123
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Citizen buy

124
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
I choose from

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
From European country

126
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Yes

127
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,303
I had a girlfriend whose parents were from Poland

128
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
And her mother said to her

129
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
If you bring

130
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
That's what's higher than black

131
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Animal

132
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
To the house

133
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
I'm going to jump off the balcony and kill mice

134
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Wow

135
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Yasso

136
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
We would make out in the garden

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
Then I joined the army I was indeed

138
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Infantry

139
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
And were you actually in combat or did you have

140
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
It was at the beginning in combat

141
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Unit

142
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
And then

143
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
They realize that I would be

144
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Much more efficient at organizing entertainment for the soldiers that's what they put me to do so my job

145
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
What's to put together

146
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
Bands I'm go from one

147
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Post to the other for example I remember right after the

148
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
Six-Day War

149
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
We went down to the Sinai

150
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,463
And drove from one position to the other

151
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
Wedding entertainers

152
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,607
And entertain the soldiers in each position

153
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
That's what we did

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Obviously.

155
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
Foretold what you would do with your life you would become a person in the entertainment industry but

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
What was that your first exposure to

157
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Jumping in

158
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Entertainment

159
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Environment

160
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
It's actually

161
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Organizing this thing

162
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,855
Yes well that's a job that gave me you know I don't know why they gave me that job I have no

163
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
Background in it

164
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Out of the fact that I

165
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Play guitar little bit

166
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
But that's a job

167
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
They assigned me to so I did

168
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
The job I was assigned and was that

169
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
What led you to kind of thinking maybe I

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
I should pursue

171
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
This after f

172
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
No

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
What led me to join a band

174
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
After I left the army

175
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
I was simply

176
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
The necessity to

177
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Make some money

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
And get out of that room and support my family

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
So that my father

180
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
They didn't have to go

181
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Door-to-door selling pants

182
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,535
At the time there was no television in Israel

183
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
That was radio

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
And I used to play

185
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
You know Beatles song

186
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
And

187
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
In our band

188
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
The lead singer

189
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
Sounded exactly like McCartney

190
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
So

191
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
We were pretty successful

192
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
Even though I was a pretty lousy bass player

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
I've read that you actually were so bad that you would turn down the apps

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
We're just at the beginning

195
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
So where did you eventually get good at it

196
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
No

197
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
I was never good enough

198
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
It was just why one day the two brothers that were kind of the basis of the band the lead singer and

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
By the way

200
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
Solo guitarist came up to me and said that

201
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,311
Why don't you be your manager

202
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
And cuz you're holding us back music

203
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
And I couldn't be happier

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
So one of the happiest days of my life was the day I put down my guitar

205
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
My last gig

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
I became a manager and then

207
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,231
You manage one band and you manage to bands and then

208
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
You build a business

209
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Surrounded

210
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
At some point you left

211
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Israel

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,495
I became a to promoter and as well and I bought

213
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Mini Aussie

214
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
Just toys route from Ray Charles to Jose Feliciano

215
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Blood Sweat and Tears

216
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,223
Many others how are you doing this is a 20-something year old

217
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Can you were just hustling you were

218
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Convincing people

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
That you were the guy to

220
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
Mark Zuckerberg a24 has built Facebook

221
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,815
Before I was able to bring Jose Feliciano to Israel what the heck

222
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
You're supposed to be

223
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Doing stuff

224
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Get all your nuts supposed to be sitting in

225
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Counting on your parents

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
Okay so so at some point

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
You moved

228
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Tattoo ideas

229
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Paris

230
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
When did you decide to do that and why

231
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
Well I move to Paris

232
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Simply because

233
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Israel was really

234
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
From a business standpoint

235
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Too small on

236
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
And

237
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Despite

238
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
My success quote on quote

239
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
I was in

240
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
That

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Of $600,000

242
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Wait you were you at $600,000

243
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
How old are you

244
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
By the time that happened I was 29

245
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
Did you accrue all that dead by the way well I had a big group of harpists from

246
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Japan in October of 1973

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Ready to pull the country and the Yom Kippur War 2 castle by surprise

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
So obviously there were no contest there was no shows there was no way for them to

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Do even leave close to the airport was closed I had to return the money I had paid them in advance

250
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
And I had a couple of other bumps in the road again that has nothing to do with

251
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,111
With me which is the devaluation of the Israeli pound which meant that

252
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
We had big shows lined up where all of the expenses were in dollars and the revenue

253
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,375
What an Israeli pounds would the devaluation of the pounds we played

254
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Two full houses and losing money every night so these two things compounded

255
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
Dockmate to $600,000 in debt

256
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
What are you freaking out I mean thinking how am I going to pay this back no I don't think I was freaking out

257
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
I was in a state of panic though

258
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
You know freaking out the fumes

259
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,023
You still have some control but when you're having massive panic attack you have no control what did you do

260
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
So I moved to France

261
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
And

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,935
So I signed this nine-year-old who sounded

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
Like an adult and Eagles

264
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
Is a fantastic singer in 9 year old singer in Israel

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
You said he was going to help you

266
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
You pay off this debt

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Well

268
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
I got very lucky I got very lucky

269
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
How did you get lucky

270
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Oh you know what

271
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
Being lucky means it means having the scale

272
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
To grab the lock when it's presented

273
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
What was the last that was

274
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
Wildest first record that I produced

275
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
Went platinum with his nine-year-old

276
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,423

277
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983

278
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
The song OG

279
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
Deficient

280
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
Basically

281
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
Strike gold with this or platinum a gas

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
Circus record and you've got a career I guess

283
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
France like it at this point to you

284
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
What did you do did you start a production company in in in France

285
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
And I started production company that I set up my own label

286
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
And

287
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,311
I sold over period of 8 years that I live there

288
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
On my own label more than 18 million records

289
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Wow

290
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
How did you even know how to cut

291
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Deals in Paris like me you get there and Israel

292
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039

Spokes in French

294
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
But how did you even know how to

295
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Wheelin dealin and

296
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
You know get a studio together

Define

Distributors

299
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
I have no idea

300
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
You just started knocking on doors

301
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Oh yeah knocking on doors as what

302
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Guido Wright comedian

303
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
You know all business people knock on doors

304
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
Old salesman knock on doors

305
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
I learned it on the job I guess

306
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
You know I don't know I never produced the record in my life

307
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
When I produce that trust tracker

308
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Why did you

309
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,743
Did you decide to move to the US I guess

310
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
In the early 80s

311
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
Well I bought a house here in 1978 and I moved here in 1983

312
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Yeah and what did you intend to do in LA

313
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
I was planning to

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,663
Basically continue doing the same thing which is creating

315
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
Producing and distributing music and

316
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Therefore I built the studio

317
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
In Studio City

318
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
And

319
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
We started

320
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Creating music for cartoons

321
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Why cartoon how to draw

322
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Steven

323
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Get into that

324
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
That world at all

325
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Well I

326
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Studied

327
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
How music is

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Paid for

329
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
In America

330
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
By ASCAP and

331
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
BMI

332
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Is the publishing

333
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
The agency

334
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
These are the publishing

335
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
That's right

336
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
8 or they are as Representatives

337
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
Collection agencies

338
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
Is what they are they pay royalties

339
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
And I pay royalties

340
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
So when I realized how

341
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Much money there is

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
And this I thought I

343
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
That would be a good idea

344
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
And was it because of her

345
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Meet with music in cartoons or just

346
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Any music

347
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
It's any music but music

348
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,823
Cartoons music can be very profitable and here's the reason why

349
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
If you look at the sitcom

350
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Darryl musical stings

351
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
So they have cumulatively maybe two minutes of music

352
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Maybe three

353
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
Banana cartoon you have wall-to-wall music

354
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
And because these collection agencies pay

355
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,791
Based on the number of Munich minutes that are

356
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
You would make a lot more money

357
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Drama music on

358
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
You know a little known cartoon

359
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,615
Then you would make on The Mary Tyler Moore Show or The Cosby Show

360
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
A lot more money on the cartoon

361
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
How did you figure that out

362
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,319
I called ASCAP and I said can you explain to me please you have at the pocket in pocket

363
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,671
And I called BMI can you please explain to me Mickey booty bukaty

364
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,255
And then I shut down and I calculated and I concluded

365
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,839
That being a member of BMI is the right way to go

366
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
And I went for it

367
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
And how did you

368
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Create cartoon music what did you do

369
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
Well I want on that knocked on door of different

370
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Cartoon producers

371
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
And I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.

372
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
And I said to them

373
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
I'll give you the music for free

374
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
If you let me keep

375
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
Bought the publisher share

376
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
As well as

377
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
The composer

378
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
And people said well that's not a bad deal we don't really pay all these composer for that then you'll do it for free I'll do it for free

379
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
I'll just keep the royalty

380
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
So what cartoons do you

381
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215

Yeah there you go

384
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Amongst many others

385
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
We went from Hanna Barbera Ruby Spears

386
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Indeed

387
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
Filmation He-Man

388
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
Just you know tons and tons of cartoons at one point

389
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,767
My music partner and I wear the top Riders at

390
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
BMI

391
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Do you remember the Heathcliff 1

392
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Heathcliff Heathcliff

393
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
If y'all don't know no no no

394
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
Heathcliff no one should

395
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
Terrorize the neighborhood

396
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Are you

397
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Are you a fan of my music

398
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Huge fan

399
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Okay

400
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
This is good

401
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
How are you getting all of this music

402
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Decompose

403
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Well

404
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,047
At a given point we have so much work that was no way

405
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
That

406
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
One or two composers can

407
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Satisfy

408
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
Get all the hundreds of episodes that we were scoring

409
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
At one point had 12 Studios studios just making music for cartoons

410
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Plug Studios making music for cartoons when people ask me what are you doing side make music for cartoons

411
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
Could see the compassion in their eyes because they thought it was no room for compassion

412
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
I was making money hand-over-fist

413
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Of course

414
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Turning point in your life I guess

415
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Happens when you discover this

416
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Japanese

417
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Live action

418
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Show

419
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Which

420
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Of course became

421
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers with tell me how did you

422
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Come across

423
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
This whole concept

424
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,111
Well in 1984 I was in Japan

425
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Now stretching on my bedroom

426
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
On the TV on the wall

427
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Only three channels

428
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
Two of them showing game shows

429
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
Alarm some other reality base

430
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
That I do not

431
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Understand a word

432
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,239
And the channel had these kids in spandex

433
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Kicking monsters butts

434
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
And I thought

435
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Hey

436
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
This looks like

437
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,687
Fun

438
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,111
It's all of a sudden dawned on me that once they turn into

439
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:11,487
Superheroes meaning in the power Rangers and they have their masses are on and they're

440
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,095
Kicking monsterbots it could be anywhere

441
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Show all of the action scenes

442
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Which is what

443
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Cost the most money

444
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,127
We're basically accounted for so I thought if I shoot an American segment with American Kids

445
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
Being an American environment

446
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
And I died this up

447
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Into the action sequence

448
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
I can create a show

449
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
Very little money because all the action scenes I would purchase

450
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
And

451
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
That that sounded to me like a great idea never mind the fact that I truly

452
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Enjoy the show

453
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
It's funny I remember cuz I was

454
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
What are the child

455
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
World we live in Japan

456
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
From 1979 to 90

457
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
U2

458
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
And I remember when I saw Mighty Morphin

459
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
Power Rangers on television America I recognized it immediately as a show that I watched

460
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
The kid in Japan

461
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
What's the show called in

462
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
In Japanese

463
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Jewel Ranger

464
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Meaning 10 Rangers

465
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
In Japanese

466
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Since you bought this in

467
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
I guess 1980s

468
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Surround them

469
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
No I bought it in 84

470
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
And I slept it remember cartoon slippers leopard

471
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
And I slept at 4:18

472
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
What do you mean you would you try that you went around trying to

473
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
People on the show

474
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Yes

475
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Well

476
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
I just

477
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Loved it and I thought that these card

478
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
So many Alamo

479
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
That we do

480
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
At the time didn't see

481
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
On America

482
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
TV

483
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
And then

484
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
I said to myself my

485
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
It's been on

486
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
For like 20 years old

487
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Something in

488
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Japan results

489
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Success

490
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
Why in the world would need work here

491
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,799
I know that some people look at it as a

492
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
Campy cheesy I don't know I heard all kinds of definitions

493
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
To me it's a lot of fun

494
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
Shaw and everytime I look at the pilot

495
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Over and over again

496
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
That I was using

497
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
Couldn't figure out why people don't see it and what are they say when you shut it

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
They said

499
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Why do you embarrass yourself

500
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

520
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
Gyros

521
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
It's 1992 and Haim Saban has been trying to sell his idea for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 2

522
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Anyone who would listen

523
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,832
I'm pretty much no one is interested

524
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
That is until he gets a meeting with an executive at Fox

525
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Names Market leche

526
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
And unlike everyone before her

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Margaret

528
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Actually likes it

529
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
She's the only person who said

530
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
There's something there

531
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
There's something there

532
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
So she orders the show to air in 1993

533
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
And

534
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
We go and produce

535
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
40 episodes

536
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Group b strep

537
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
On the fox kids network which at the time is the number one Outlet

538
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
For kids

539
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm producing it meaning I'm just there

540
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
With every script every outline

541
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Every frame

542
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,376
Every daily every sound effects every piece of music every casting I'm not

543
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,192
You know letting this thing go to anybody

544
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
Basically

545
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
What's wheat producer

546
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
There's a mutiny at Fox

547
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Books from Rupert Murdoch on down and the group of a failure to basically say

548
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
This is horrible with nothing to air it

549
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
This executive Margaret

550
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
She goes to pack

551
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
So what she said she said look

552
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
I can fight

553
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
All my bosses

554
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
The Tetra I understand all of that

555
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
So I'm going to air it

556
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Early in the morning

557
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
In the summer

558
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
And I'm going to Eric for 8 weeks right

559
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Disassemble

560
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Some of my teeth

561
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Correct

562
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
And I'm down I'm going to take it off and will College

563
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,624
I said you know what I'll take it. I'll take whatever you give me and did you buy the rights to the show

564
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
100%

565
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
So you take this deal because you will have no other choice you

566
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
That's why

567
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
And she believed in it

568
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
Stephen told her that she's playing her career by putting this show on just scrap it

569
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
But you believed in it and she just

570
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
Put it on and within less than a week it beat every other show

571
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
Across it generated the highest rating of any show on Fox schedule

572
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
At the time you had Looney Tunes or Tiny Toons you had Batman you had all these

573
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
Shows that Weatherhead softbox kids and he delivered double triple the ratings of oldies show

574
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
Tell course that 8 weeks

575
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
Was renewed right right away

576
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
Because it was such a monster head for her

577
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
Yeah I know I asked you this but I'm still trying to figure it out like

578
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,576
How did you know this was going to be

579
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,160
It's called in Yiddish kishka meaning in my cut

580
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
God is many times more important than brain

581
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
I have to tell you that the biggest hits

582
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:15,168
That I had in my life ending music and hunting television

583
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
And hunting business

584
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
Have been

585
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Always

586
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,640
As a result of significant which action

587
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
And the repeated regex

588
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,832
So every time I have an idea that people tell me no don't do that oops

589
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
You I mean

590
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
When that happened when that show was a hit

591
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
You go to other people's at

592
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Told you this

593
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Who's going to record

594
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,608
Before you just I didn't have time to go then people whatever I got my

595
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
What do you want from me

596
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Okay so Power Rangers

597
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
Is doing great

598
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
You got the directions

599
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Saban entertainment

600
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Yes

601
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
And then about a year later

602
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Fox

603
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
To buy your

604
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,368
Well I'm approached by Rupert Murdoch himself at the time

605
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
This is what round 90

606
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Before 95

607
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
94

608
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
And

609
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,328
He has all kinds of concept that he's putting on the table

610
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
And I was holding firm

611
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
P**** money with exchange hands

612
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,800
We would put our content into a joint venture

613
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
And he would put

614
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
The network

615
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Walk into that joint

616
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
You were basically saying yes I am not looking

617
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Sell my car

618
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Create a joint

619
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Adventure with you

620
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Correct I realize that they

621
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Sweetie

622
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:44,000
Great to have a great piece of content that is a game changer for a network

623
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
But to own that that work

624
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
What's the weather like outside

625
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Fox new kids coming to you and saying

626
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,032
We want to buy your production company and all your cartoon

627
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
And you're saying

628
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
American Electric

629
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
If you give me half of

630
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Fox kids is that right

631
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Yes

632
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
Figure out why Rupert Murdoch with

633
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Take that deal and he couldn't

634
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Do all this without you

635
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
What he asked Margaret

636
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
Was running Fox easy to duplicate buchheim has done

637
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,376
Including his International distribution and presence

638
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Worldwide

639
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
How long will it take

640
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
And she said

641
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
I can do it but it might take me five years plus

642
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
And he wanted to know work right away

643
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
He walked it

644
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Presence

645
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
And that

646
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,320
Categoria and by doing this joint venture with me

647
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,648
He was instantly in the worldwide

648
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Kids bus

649
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,744
So he basically agreed to give you

650
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Half of fox

651
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Kids networking

652
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Exchange for

653
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Your distribution Network

654
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
Cartoons that you had

655
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
But then at that point you owned

656
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Half of the

657
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
The kid Network

658
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240

I mean the pretty incredible

660
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Gamble Utah

661
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Rejected is a

662
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Original offer

663
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,408
Yeah I mean I wasn't going to do anything

664
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
I wasn't going to

665
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
Bring in a partner in a company I own 200

666
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah

667
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
So

668
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
What what are you guys doing

669
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
What's your next move

670
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
What's the next movie called Chase Carey and Margaret last one day

671
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Chase Carey was a chief operating officer

672
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,984
And I said look I got this idea we should be

673
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
And the 24/7

674
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah and that is only one channel

675
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
That is

676
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Knox

677
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
Part of the big conglomerate

678
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
And that has folded

679
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Distribution

680
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
That we can buy and that's

681
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
The family

682
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Old buy petrol

683
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
The Taliban

684
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Correct

685
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Basically you wanted Fox

686
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
To help you convince

687
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Pat Robertson to sell it

688
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Right

689
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
And they said to me

690
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Well

691
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,704
Did he would never sell

692
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Icilome

693
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Well how about we ask

694
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
How about that

695
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,152
So they meet with Pat Robertson Pat Robertson they call me afterwards

696
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
They say about Roberts

697
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Monticello

698
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,064
But I chase is going to meet with his son pin

699
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Tim Roberts

700
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Pat Robertson's son

701
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:23,232
And maybe the try to find some kind of copper

702
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Joni Mitchell

703
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Dim

704
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
A few days later

705
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,888
And I say can I come and you said no no no

706
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,240
I'll handle it I said okay fine if you didn't want you there because they thought you were going to be

707
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Pain in the neck

708
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Abacus

709
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:42,688
Maybe they were concerned that I would be too pushy or I don't know I don't know I don't know I just

710
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,760
Care all I cared about was a result I didn't care

711
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
So he goes to the meeting with Tim he comes back and he says

712
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Nothing to do

713
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
I said okay you're done

714
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
You said you would. I said okay I want you to come

715
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
To a dinner with Tim and myself

716
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
Always not there

717
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
You

718
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
Should be you should have a dinner with

719
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Tim

720
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
And you said let me have a shot of

721
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Just let me see it

722
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,152
Right and we set the three of us at dinner and I said what I said

723
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
We left the dinner with a deal in French

724
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:22,112
What did you say to him that I don't want to get into what I told him I want to get

725
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Into I can tell you that chase told me at the end of the dinner you're crazy man

726
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
What are you doing

727
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,168
I said don't worry about it we'll figure it out

728
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,824
Housemate has a bit of a negative

729
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Not true

730
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:49,248
Natural natural you speak English better than I

731
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
I was hustling

732
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Andy Robertson then says okay we have a deal. We had some sort of a joint venture

733
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Concept

734
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
That's what we agreed upon

735
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,120
That brutal negotiation

736
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Evolve

737
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,728

738
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776

1.9 billion

741
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Which

742
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
Sounds like a lot of money what was it a good deal

743
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
No it was.

744
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624

750
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,376
And then you transition into a kids

751
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Shell was that

752
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Is it hard to do that

753
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:45,056
No look I mean we converted the channel from the channel That targeted people

754
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
80 +

755
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,176
80 years old plus survey they was a disaster Zone

756
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,528
Demographic standpoint so we struggled for a couple of days

757
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,856
And then as we were turning the corner

758
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
I realized

759
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
We had built the company

760
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
That was

761
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
Worth between 5 and 5 and 1/2 billion dollars

762
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
Competing with companies that will work

763
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
10 to 20 times

764
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
The Disney Store

765
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
And so on so

766
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
I came to the conclusion

767
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
That it's time to sell

768
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
So so wait this is about

769
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
5 years in

770
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Yes

771
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
And so you have this channel

772
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
Fox Family

773
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
And then what

774
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
You decide you want to sell it right

775
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Can you own half of it

776
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
But then Spock's don't

777
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Like how are you able

778
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Seoul

779
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
I had the right

780
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Based on my contract

781
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Red fox

782
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
To put my share today

783
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Which I did

784
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
And we said

785
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
Negotiate

786
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456
They told me that they thought my share was worth half a billion I told them that my share is worth 2 billion

787
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Let's sit down and talk

788
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Yeah but half a billion dollars

789
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
A lot of money

790
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Why not 2 billion is more

791
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,696
But you could have walked away at that point with half a billion dollars

792
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,816
Would have been up I wasn't going to walk away with a half a billion dollars that was not a shot in hell I was

793
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Going to do that okay

794
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
My stake in the company's what do William that's what I thought

795
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,824
So what did you end up doing so I didn't want to get into a pissing match with my butt

796
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Give me a property to sell it

797
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,760
If I can sell it for four and a half billion dollars would you sell it with me so you're sure they said yes

798
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
That I ended up selling it for 5.3

799
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
How did you do

800
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Whatever two potential buyers

801
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
One was CBS and the other one was

802
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
And Disney was

803
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072

Dead in the asset

806
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,472
And they ended up putting up

807
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
The right amount of money

808
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032

Easily with more than a billion dollar

812
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176

Half a billion

821
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232

And Israel which took me in when I was a refugee

869
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,064
So there's a lot of gratification in that

870
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
When you look in the mirror

871
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464

00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,072
Yeah it's almost as good as Go Go Power Rangers

898
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864

Thanks to one of our sponsors Microsoft Surface

904
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
Introducing the new Surface go

905
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,520
The smallest Microsoft Surface ever

906
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
Just over one pound as a

907
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
The 10-inch screen

908
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
The new Surface go has

909
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
The performance of a laptop

910
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
But with the portability

911
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Tablet

912
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

913
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,256
I know for how you built that and today we're going to the story we ran about a year ago

914
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,096
And back then Chris Waters wake up every morning

915
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:05,728
And hedge was job as an account manager at a software company

916
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Desk phone usually talking to relatively unhappy people now as you can imagine Chris prefers to talk

917
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
Relatively happy people which explains how he started his side business a few years back he was in the

918
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Reddit

919
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:24,672
And read it has this thing around Christmas time where they'll connect you with a total stranger

920
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
And then you can send them a gift and I got matched for this guy who live 20 minutes away and I was thinking

921
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,448
About what to give him and what I could do with this great opportunity where you live so close

922
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
And Chris was thinking Way Beyond the scope of this hold secret Santa thing you don't send a boring

923
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
Gift card or a snack box and fortunately I was hosting a weekly poker game with my friends and I had

924
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
I just happen to one five weeks in a row and so

925
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
I had a lot of extra money like almost

926
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
$2,000 in extra money in Kristen. Just paid forward and put together this really

927
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Inexpensive I like doing things for the people I like creating something

928
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
Special and magical

929
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,592
And if you have the opportunity to do something truly spectacular for someone including an internet store

930
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Grainger

931
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
You should take that opportunity

932
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:25,088
Chris is really into scavenger hunts and buried treasure in planting Clues and stuff like that so

933
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
First secret a guy Chris wound up planning this

934
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Credible

935
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,792
Day-long Adventure at 8 a.m. a century-old suitcase

936
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:39,680
Filled with envelopes and a box with a chain wrapped around it was hand delivered to his door

937
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:46,080
This is all happening around Scottsdale Arizona by the way they got to a place where there was an envelope with two tickets to the zoo

938
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,480
And at the animal pens there was kind of a cipher that you used to decode the message and then it sent them to

939
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:58,880
Restaurant where the servers said we've been expecting you

940
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
Hundred dollars of his poker money on tickets and chachis and clues meals all for the total

941
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,864
Will stranger and at the end of this incredible day

942
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,472
Chris actually met up with the guy at a local bar his name is Blaine and as you might guess

943
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,872
Blaine was pretty blown away and couple days later Blaine posted to Reddit and it just blew

944
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
Blaine's post about his secret santa experience went to number one on Reddit front page

945
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Started to get inundated with messages just people commenting and privately messaging thing that you need to do this in Vegas you need to

946
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Anyone here I live in England can you come over here and do this and then business is saying we would like to be apart of this and

947
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,168
That is how Chris started his business constructed Adventures

948
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
He puts together these personalized scavenger hunt Cindy long excursions for people's birthdays and marriage from

949
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
Puzzles and stuff like that

950
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,991
Pretty good money minimums probably going to cost them about $2,000

951
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:03,391
For the whole shebang anyway just days before we ran Christmas Story last year he's actually

952
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,975
She submitted his letter of resignation at that boring office job

953
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,791
And he started to do constructed Adventures

954
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
Full time I honestly I should be more nervous and I should be scared but if I can quit my job

955
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:20,287
And spend my life doing that for other people I'd say it's a pretty good life

956
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:26,687
Since we last spoke to Chris he's plans 24 more adventures and he's made around $100,000

957
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
Dollars in revenue and he's also been approached by a production company that wants to do a TV show about it

958
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
