And I did and I remember it like I was taking anyone who would meet with me I was asking for people who would give me advice

32
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I was looking for advisors just literally paint

33
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Literally fire during a Starbucks and I really do want to work for my company my company was

Billion dollars

43
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Most of us

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
You me your friend's spouse is whoever

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Do not know how to organize

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Our finances

47
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
I just just think about it

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
The average US household has at 16

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Thousand dollars

50
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Credit card

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
And 2/3 of us

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
Have less than a thousand bucks in our savings account

53
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
One more

54
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
The median amount of money the average American has saved for retirement

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
5

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
$1000 switch

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
And I hope I'm not freaking out here

58
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,744
This is not enough money to get you very far after

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
You stopped working

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Even her well-educated friends

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Think much about financial planning

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
Especially because the whole process can seem in

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Frankly something

64
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
You do when you're older

65
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Let's face it it's

66
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
But it's super

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
Back in 2006

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
What's an opportunity

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
The opportunity to build a company

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
It could demystify financial planner

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
Especially for young p

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
People people without a lot of money

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
Had a big party idea came from a traumatic

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Experience that

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
She had as a teenager

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,080
Alexa grew up in Jacksonville Florida her mom was a nurse

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Kitchener

78
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
And her dad

79
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
What's a pediatrician

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
So I

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Would go to my dad's office

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Notify alive clean up all the toys

83
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
And actually I think

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
My dad wanted me to like observe

85
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
Other families going through

86
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Do challenges

87
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
Some days I eat kind of pull on that more than I

88
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Even realize now that I have my own family

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
I think

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
Basic minimum wage

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
Fun things I want to do but yeah I got a job really early and actually one summer I even put into a

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
And I are a witch my dad

93
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Kind of taught me early about financial planning in that way

94
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
So your dad was Doctor your mom was a nurse nurse practitioner

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
I'm so it sounds like you had a

96
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Economic science

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
I did all the my mom was like a developmental

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Specialist

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
So I always joke that I think my parents probably like secretly had me take like six or seven different tests like whatever they were

100
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Trying out at work I remember just like

101
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
A few times sitting down and

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
People take my cake

103
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Go just like

104
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Computer test really quickly

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
I was joking they were testing me for hyperactivity because I have so much energy

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
But yeah really

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
Sciency luke kuechly signs he like my daddy

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Make potions to turn fire in the fireplace

109
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Purple and blue

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,327
Putting some chemicals in it I've no idea what they were

111
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
And that's kind of what I would do with my dad is going to geek out on that stuff and I'm sure in some very subtle

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Way that really influence kind of my own patented

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Technology

114
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
So

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,175
Pretty stable childhood right I mean get you to pretty kind of

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Stable

117
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Middle upper middle class

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Stop ringing

119
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
In Jacksonville Florida

120
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,463
Yeah I was a really stable except for when I was 14 my dad unexpectedly passed away and I think that

121
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Kind of seeing

122
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Throws and it gives in an axe

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
I didn't say it was very much like

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
Noise stop sound stop time stopped

125
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
Can ask any child who lost their parent they

126
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
You unfortunately remember

127
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Every minute every day

128
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
Of that whole period of time it's like

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
It's burned into your Pinterest

130
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Remember

131
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
The day that

132
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
It was 1998

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
June 9th of 1998

134
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
My dad is going to work I was supposed to go

135
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
I work with him that day

136
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
And I I didn't because

137
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
I was here that.

138
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
Beginning to be an adolescent and I was like I asked you want to go and you'll hang out with friends today

139
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
And I remember cuz I'm pulling up to my house

140
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,431
Just saying tons of police lights and

141
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
Frankly was like the like I literally felt like a horror scene

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
And

143
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
I just knew something was real

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Really bad and my dad

145
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Got in an accident and passed away and

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
I remember

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
Literally processing this is my worst nightmare.

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
This is my worst nightmare

149
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
And

150
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,471
And I said that kind of weeks my by after the biggest thing that really stuck with me.

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Is

152
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Life is

153
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,895
Literally so short like one second you can breathe in the next second it kidding just literally the over

154
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,551
And I think that was the thing that was grappling with the most of those few days because I wasn't physically present and I didn't see the app

155
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Accident

156
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,183
It was just like wait but he was here this morning saying goodbye to me and then all the sudden I'm coming home and it's it's

157
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
I'm here

158
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
I know we're going to get

159
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Tennis later on

160
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
You're at your mom and your Marianne

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Successful career

162
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Is there a day that goes by that you don't think about your

163
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
It's such a good

164
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Question

165
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
In the absolute truth is like

166
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
No not a day goes by it's like the

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
Totally getting choked up

168
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
The truth is that every day

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
It's really really simple

170
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Small Things big things

171
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
The songs that we sing to my daughter now

172
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Her song that he loved

173
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
So

174
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,775
No and I think any person who's lost someone they really really love

175
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Nose.

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
I think when we think about

177
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Losing somebody

178
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
In our lives we

179
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
Obviously and of course we think about the emotional impact of that

180
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Don't think about we don't

181
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Talk about witches

182
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
The impact on

183
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
I have family function to me often times

184
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
There's one

185
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
Current kind of handles things like finances and

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Bills and

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
The household

188
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Stop and

189
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
It's complicated when one of them

190
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Pass away

191
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Exactly

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,967
Tencent kind of dishes where some of the idea of her learnvest and

193
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Might my own like

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Unclear ultrasabers really born which is

195
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
First

196
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
That kind of alluded to

197
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
What's my parents

198
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
Very skilled very very capable people

199
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
But still tradition has its

200
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Ring on a family right so I

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
My mom managed the budget it's definitely where I get my skill of being very frugal from

202
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
And then my dad managed all of our

203
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Investments in kind of the bigger picture and

204
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
To be clear my my mom's a tough cookie like she's

205
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
Very brave

206
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Very very smart

207
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,183
Tom there's nothing that she really tries away from but she didn't manage our investment so I think that's the best way to put it

208
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
I think it's true for millions of households by

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,583
My dad passed away one of the really clear things I remember was

210
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
My mom just didn't

211
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Have a really clear handle on

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
Where everything was in what the picture look like

213
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Night remember my mom being like

214
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Not

215
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Quite sure

216
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Like how many was going to work

217
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Imaginative

218
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Potentially

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
Paralyzing thing for for for any family

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
You're so I think this is one of the things

221
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
Guy that really stuck with me is

222
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
Just 14

223
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
Just knowing that like my mom was even questioning that like

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,631
It kind of made me sick to my stomach that there was one other thing that she the worry about

225
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
And so it is really like the last song

226
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Impression

227
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
When your life is

228
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,895
Crumbling in Lakeview are devastated whether it is an illness or an unexpected accident that like takes away a loved one

229
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,271
Or losing your job or are your partner walking out on your life whatever it may be all the things that Crush people

230
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
I don't want you have to worry about money I don't want money to even be

231
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Flash in those times I wanted to be like

232
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
You're good right

233
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Which

234
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
College and I started getting

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Starting things I'm interested in

236
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
I ended up

237
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Literally

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Financial planning class

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,823
Like how many credit cards should I have and you know how do we think about these things in like just basics

240
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
And there was no class and there were no

241
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,711
There was there wasn't a program and I just remembered kind of being appalled

242
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
That I can't teach myself this life skill

243
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Easily

244
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,111
And you know that kind of is some of the seedlings of like

245
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
Really where learn bass was truly born

246
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,607
Did you have like an entrepreneurial kind of mind in in college

247
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,239
Maybe Rich business even part of your thought process

248
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
It's so funny

249
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Which was never something that seems like exciting if that makes any sense that said I always

250
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Thought like

251
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,831
CEOs of companies were like rockstars and because I just find them so

252
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
So interesting and I just want to learn everything

253
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,279
That coupled with if you ask my mom my mom would tell you I was an entrepreneur at like Age 4

254
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Because I was

255
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
Instead of having a lemonade stand I was actually thinking things out of my house that I wasn't allowed to have

256
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,079
And selling them like

257
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
I got in a lot of trouble a handful times cuz I once took a piece of art off the wall but I just didn't think we needed

258
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
So you are at your first

259
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
Job out of college was was with Morgan Stanley right

260
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Trader

261
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
I kept saying like Okay just like a good foundation of job that will give me the foundation of what

262
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
But I think I wanted to but I had this

263
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,639
Really constant energy of like I want to build I want to create I want to make

264
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,271
Nerd with kitties like really wild notebooks of like list of ideas of things I was excited about

265
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
I'm glad you have learned that had already been kind of boring in my head of like why don't we learn about money why isn't there a better way to do this

266
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Why isn't there something out there

267
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
And I'm just wondering

268
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Back to when I was in college and

269
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,727
I really wasn't thinking about financial plan on going to be on Sunday like I wasn't

270
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
It wasn't something

271
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
That we ever crossed my mind not

272
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,431
Jamie maybe I was irresponsible or maybe I was just not that intelligent but I just did

273
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
Think about I thought

274
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
What's going to be interesting

275
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
I like studying history it's interest

276
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
What that was

277
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Extent

278
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
So I'm

279
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
I'm trying to figure out how was it

280
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
You suck

281
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
Financial planning this is something that more people should know about

282
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Cuz you're like in your

283
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
Early Twenties that just seems like a boring

284
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
At that point in life

285
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
It's so boring and I'm not I was like

286
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Here I am saying accepted the job at Morgan

287
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
I remember sitting there being like I work

288
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
At like a great financial firm

289
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
It's like I'm on a trading desk

290
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,807
And I am sitting here struggling with like do I put money in my 401k or my IRA

291
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Write like basic

292
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
I just would like if I feel this way and I don't even know

293
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
Have a family I don't even have a mortgage I don't even

294
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Going to have kids like

295
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
I feel pretty lost

296
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
With my financial planning

297
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
How do other people feel so I started asking

298
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
I asked everyone who would talk to me

299
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
How do you feel about your wallet is it stressing you out

300
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
And

301
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
It literally it was amazing everyone I would ask what date

302
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
I have no idea

303
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Young old

304
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
Money no money people who had like you

305
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Golden parachute

306
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
McNair family excetera

307
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
From that I was like

308
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
This is a knife

309
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
That was the beginning of learnvest

310
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
That's how I started working on it and I embarked on it being like this is the sexiest idea cuz guy there was another

311
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Part of me that struggled with

312
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
I need to do something that is so cool this wasn't cool

313
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
I knew that

314
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Honestly

315
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Core part of me that just scared

316
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
So damn much

317
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
That that's what was right I just I was like

318
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
I was hooked

319
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Stuck and I had to go.

320
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
You are at Morgan Stanley

321
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Wrangler

322
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Yes so I was at Morgan Stanley

323
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
An essential that gave up having a real social life

324
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
Like nights and weekend I would like

325
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,351
I put together the 75-page ish business plan that nobody read

326
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
I was all my thoughts in one place on what this

327
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,751
Futurelearn bass company learn bastard for learn in.

328
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
Even though by the bad guy

329
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Build what I was going to look like

330
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
But I started feeling like

331
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Get it like this is what I meant to

332
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
Places around 2008/2009 2016

333
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,879
You got this idea for learnvest

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
And and you leave Morgan Stanley

335
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
But I guess right about this time you actually

336
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
Start going to Harvard Business School

337
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,911
So I enter business school in September 2008

338
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
And I actually took my

339
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Leave of absence

340
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
School on December 8th

341
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
2008

342
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Saddest thing about 90 days

343
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
And I drop my business

344
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Is plan and when

345
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Basically the economy crash like

346
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
If you remember guy that followed 2008

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Blood. It was a nightmare and that actual

348
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Kicked my courage

349
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Steven hire Garibay

350
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Because

351
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
I said to myself this is literally a time when

352
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
Anyone in my family anyone I knew was like should I be

353
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Selling my all in all my retirement Into Cash

354
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
People were putting money under their mattresses like

355
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Everyone was

356
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Terrified

357
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,127
So in the midst of all this chaos you thought paid leave in the school and start a business

358
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,247
Yeah and I was like this is a Time in America needs more financial planning than ever

359
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
It literally was the scariest big decision that I had had to make personally and so December 18th

360
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
And then I said I'd like to take a leave of absence where you get like a one-year and then you can keep it

361
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
I did that and then I would literally said to myself I was taking a plane ride from there I'm to New York and I said

362
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
I literally cried the entire play Silent like it was like one of those

363
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
You know you see people crying on the street

364
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,247
Straight talk I was just crying on this plane to myself

365
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Thing like what

366
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,159
Gabby that something like you were an a student you went to Harvard Business School

367
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,487
Clearly you are a good student clearly you followed rules

368
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,095
I hope you don't strike me as a, cuz you risk taker

369
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,727
What what what what is this stability

370
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
And just go into

371
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
I'm I'm I'm laughing because the

372
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,151
Truth is I am a rule follower but I think there's this other

373
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Greeley

374
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Another really really deep

375
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
Part of me guy that is where I go to to make my decisions which is

376
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,647
I always say there's a little to one of the things I learned in Psychology is that

377
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
If your a sponge a nine-year-old

378
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
How to say hey what are you regret

379
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
They never regret

380
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
The stuff

381
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
That they did

382
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
They never regret that I kissed a boy or I

383
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
Quit this job or I did these things are spent this money

384
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Ever

385
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
US 9 year olds

386
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
They always regret the rest they didn't

387
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
So you

388
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Leaving school

389
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
And you

390
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
You move to New York to start

391
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Learn.

392
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
That's where our office is

393
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
We're going to be that's where I was going to hire p

394
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
People New York is the finance capital

395
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
The world

396
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
Very early startup day so really important to say out loud

397
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
There there isn't a lot of likes

398
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
They're like there was not a startup

399
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
Community truly in York and I kind of Base

400
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
I wish I had this myON

401
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Funeral Cinderella moment

402
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
I got 9 month

403
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Savings

404
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Basic Finance

405
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,103
A plan I knew that if I hadn't raise money like an angel round 2 actually

406
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Get going

407
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,711
I wasn't able to find this out of my pocket and hump

408
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
So I had them from all of my bonuses and everything from Morgan Stanley about $75,000

409
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Enough to

410
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
I mean you could start with yourself

411
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
It wouldn't be enough.

412
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Give you that much

413
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
One engineer

00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
That was about $10,000 a month

415
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
One really high quality engineer New York

416
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
And you knew this was going to be a tech company

417
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Who's going to be web-based or

418
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,079
At the time I wouldn't have said it was technology

419
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Company I was like I'm building a

420
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Consumer

421
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Internet timeout

At the minimum 152

426
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
$20,000 a year so like my money was indenting anything

427
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
So how did you get that the seed money to start

428
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Yasso

Start hustling

432
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,983
And I did and I remember it like I was taking anyone who would meet with

433
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
With me I was asking for people who would

434
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Give me advice

435
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
I'm looking for advisors

436
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
I'm in little by little over the next

437
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Do you mind I started gaining

438
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Actual company

439
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711

I'm Iris said me working 30% of 40

441
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
Percent full-time on a startup does one thing me working a hundred

442
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Percent of my time like literally not do

443
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Anything else

444
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
You just I just started seeing results and it felt like this little bit of snowball in

445
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
This is actually my husband

446
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Speech at our wedding

447
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583

Success he's like that I watched it

450
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
And he and his big joke

451
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
If you would come home from work

452
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
11 p.m. and I'd be like furiously still working

453
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
And one of two things is happy

454
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Meaning I was either clutch

455
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Like a bottle of wine

456
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Or some days by The Wanted

457
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,623
Cookie and he like new boats

00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,743

$750,000 to be exact

512
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
In 2009

513
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728

Andy knew I would pay for them to get coffee with me and bring them lunch in like I was like I know it's like a gopher I was at whoever or meat

520
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
You really grind people waste my time for sure who were like

521
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
Totally uninterested in and those socks

522
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,704
Can I leave an object demoralizing that I have to suck it up

523
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
It's 5 minutes later and my next meeting and I should run and how did you make the pitch how do you convince people

524
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Even

525
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
You

526
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
With all of your intelligence and talent were so young

527
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
At that time

528
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,576
I was and I will tell you I'm at you know

529
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Just turned

530
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
25

531
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
I'm I was not proven I've never done this

532
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Before

533
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,512
But I think one of the things that I kind of really rested on

534
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Guy was that I'd written the 75

535
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,680
Researched it I knew my stuff and if if there was going to be someone in this

536
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Space that you

537
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Could care about

538
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Like I

539
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
I was all in

540
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
In that nine months of trying to raise money this is like

541
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,016
Collapse in the country's collapse and there's there's a huge bailouts in

542
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Stimulus packages in p

543
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,136
People are freaking out

544
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
I'm trying to figure out how you were able to

545
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
To convince people to

546
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
To give you money

547
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
A time when I can imagine nobody

548
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Monica take

549
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632

550
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
You nailed it I would say

551
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
A year-and-a-half

552
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Sounds like just take

553
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
People's names in following up with them instinct

554
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Persistent

555
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
One Direction

556
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
She said no to me then

557
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
Came back and buy the summer

558
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Was like you know what I mean like

559
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Crazy like your

560
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
Totally committed

561
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
One of the things I really held onto through that time as I even had a few people that were like mentors to me who were great entrepreneurs ahead of

562
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
I never liked you can do it in this environment you can do it anytime later

563
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
They're like they're like the entrepreneur

564
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
True survivor

565
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Literally like

566
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
Multiple like jumping through knives and hoops

567
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
You can get through it like

568
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Uconnect

569
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Thrive

570
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
It was true

571
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
But you were you were saying to people

572
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
I'm going to offer

573
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
What

574
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
So what I was saying to pee

575
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
People AIDS

576
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,904
We are going to go after a younger Millennial audience

577
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
We are going to be the

578
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Searching for their money

579
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
For them understanding

580
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Everything to do with their money

581
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
And everything was

582
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
With sound really Broad

583
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
The point was it with content in providing the education

584
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,216
And the tool so we built our own swover you could aggregate

585
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
All of your money in one place

586
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
And then we launched

587
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Advise and advice

588
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
But you could call in

589
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Talk to someone

590
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
So you would talk to one of our planners

591
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
We are going to apply

592
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Super modern world today

593
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
That's so

594
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Open 24 hours a day

595
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Super super

596
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Refresh

597
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Banks

598
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Timer

599
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Stupid ads on

600
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,512
TV that were like we're open on Saturdays from like 11 to 2 when you were like

601
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
What is a cat's so irrelevant for

602
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632
A young person who doesn't even want to walk to the bank

603
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
See you on the site I think in in mm

604
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
How'd it go

605
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
2010

606
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640
Like just like all good Founders have the

607
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Storysite went off

608
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Daily candy cupboard Austin weather

609
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
News outlets cover.

610
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Site crash

611
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
4500

612
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,696
I think around that the first day the next day with episode back up another few thousand

613
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
People sign up and in that first tweet about 10000

614
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Wood sign.

615
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
And just

616
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
To your point

617
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
Boring

618
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Like you say dailycandy in another p

619
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
People like

620
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Was it pitched as a

621
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Hey this is freon

622
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
People are this is for women or this

623
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Mike Howard

624
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
How was it

625
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
It was literally pitched his like

626
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,856
Anybody who wants to get like their butt kicked about their wallet in in a way that's like plain English and

627
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Go to learn bass

628
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
And we had

629
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,280
10-day email program that was basically going to give you like a

630
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Simple overview on

631
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Every

632
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
Young fortnite to find younger

633
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
I think 40 is Young

634
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
Person young person

635
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
I need Center steamer wallet

636
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
And we 10000

637
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
PayPal sign up

638
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
Any open rates and engagement with the site work

639
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Massive

640
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
And I remember being like

641
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
While this data is

642
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Really compelling

643
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
And we had a bunch of advertisers jump out

644
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Addison sofa

645
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
By February 15

646
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
I remember cuz

647
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
She's right on that Valentine

648
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Wednesday

649
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
I'm literally we are in a play

650
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
The spot where

651
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
We had

652
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Haunted Adventure

653
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Italiana New York

654
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
I was like

655
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Wow okay

656
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,336
So we ended up taking just under 5 million dollars from Excel bench

657
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,664
Partners in a bunch of other really cool people

658
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Nearest threw in some money at that point

659
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
And in short what we felt was

660
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
TurboTax

661
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
For financial planning

662
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
No

663
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
A way for you to come

664
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
Very affordably get a financial

665
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
A plan

666
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
I'm most Financial

667
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
The plans cost

668
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
Is $5,000

669
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,352
I don't know about you guys but if you're in your twenties and thirties you're not really ready to go spend

670
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
No $5,000 on a financial plan when you're trying to figure out

671
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
Do with the $5,000 do you have

672
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Extra

673
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
So is it I mean so

674
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
So you didn't have to hire a lot

675
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
And lots of financial

676
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Advisor

677
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
People to say

678
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Here's that you should do here

679
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
You should do because

680
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
As you were developing

681
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Essentially

682
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
A software that

683
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
Give you answers based on the on the day that you that you

684
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
You put in

685
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Correct

686
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
Helping software is not

687
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
Easy or inexpensive things to do and you need

688
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
Not just like

689
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,936
10 Engineers you need tens of engineer's

690
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,288
Very sophisticated Engineers with certified financial planners

691
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,896
And to develop this software so essentially what we started doing was we started

692
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,224
Asking people we had their data sing what are the questions you have

693
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,064
I'm in really listening and eventually we developed

694
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Software that I liked

695
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Think of it as GPS

696
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Fairmoney

697
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
It gives a real several sense

698
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
And then from there we didn't kick

699
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Kick your butt we would hold you accountable we

700
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Gnu action items

701
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Go close this account go open this

702
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Account

703
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
What we would see was it was

704
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
Just a very Innovative way to

705
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
Answer your

706
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,104
The entire business model is built

707
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Around

708
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Scribers rather than

709
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Getting you know

710
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,552
Commission from like steering people into a specific investment are fun

711
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Cracked

712
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
And then on the

713
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Business-to-business sideways

714
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
We sold learnvest at work

715
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
And that was weird

716
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Really big companies

717
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
Started coming gas and actually

718
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
It kind of shows you like the nimbleness of an entrepreneur

719
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
I remember we'd a really big

720
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
Big Brandon Carter

721
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Become. Since they hate

722
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
Buy this for employees

723
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,616
And things you say yeah of course we can figure that out

724
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
12 like

725
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
You guys have raised

726
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
25 million dollars are even more when you were growing so fast

727
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
So much attention

728
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Dislike

729
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
Caught the attention of big companies

730
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
Is Charles Schwab in other

731
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,584
Or other companies offering financial planning

732
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Yep

733
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
So why I would say bye like 2012-2013

734
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
14

735
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
We were having active conversations with

736
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Either for Business Partnership

737
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,200
Or sponsorship sponsorship deals or they wanted to license or white label our software so

738
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
All of a sudden lots and lots of business interest

739
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
Coming. But nobody was saying we're going to

740
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
What we did was really radically different and so

741
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,328
No one was quite set up the way we were which was

742
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,704
Kylie humans we still really believed in the power of humans and still do to this minute

743
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,848
And we were just really convicted because of our principles of every American deserves a financial plan

744
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,176
It needs to be cheaper it shouldn't you one thing I said over and over

745
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,736
Initial planning should not be a luxury product

746
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,856
Yeah the big brokerage firms don't really want to talk to you unless you have over $250,000

747
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
It doesn't

748
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
And I just a vowel what if we

749
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Tip it on her

750
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Non-attachment

751
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
And really make this

752
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Do you

753
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Is any

754
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
Part of you motivated

755
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Buy competition likes

756
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
Do you want to win

757
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
This is a really good question

758
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,872
I'm hyper motivated I get up I get up with like a spring in my step I want to go

759
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Do things

760
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
But my whole life I've always been like

761
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
I don't joke

762
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Additive if that makes any sense

763
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
What I figured out is there

764
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
There's two types of people there's competitors

765
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
And there's a cheevers

766
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Cheevers wake up at their own 2

767
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
To do list of things that they want to do by the end of the day

768
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
And

769
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
Focus on getting those things

770
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
And it's very much

771
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
You know within your own swim Lane

772
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
Competitors actually are looking to

773
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
To the people together swimlanes want to beat them

774
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
I'm not a competitor

775
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
The achiever in me is super

776
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Focused on

777
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
You're raising the bar for myself and things I think

778
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Compilation

779
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
And it was just a really good distinction in one of my best friends

780
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,904
She goes I wouldn't be your best friend if you're a competitor alright so you guys

781
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Rock the race

782
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Cuz you're doing really well

783
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
You're growing and then

784
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
2015

785
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
You

786
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
You get acquired by

787
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
My Northwestern Mutual was that

788
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
Was that part of your

789
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
Your plan for the beginning that that you would have that exit

790
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
So

791
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
I always have a good on

792
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Preneur

793
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
It's not that you don't ever say

794
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Think about an ex

795
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Prodigy

796
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
But it's not your goal

797
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,832
Gomez let's continue to stay in business and get bigger and bigger and deliver more more

798
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Keep making this work

799
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
So Fast Forward 2014

800
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Literally Northwestern Mutual

801
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Emailed in

802
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm asking to invest and and and

803
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
And you're my board said yes

804
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
Ambassador

805
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
April 2014

806
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Buy that thing

807
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Giving

808
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
The CEO John

809
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Rashad Smith

810
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Can we spend some time

811
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Weider really good conversation and it

812
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Quickly turned into him saying hey

813
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
We both believe in the same things which is

814
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
We believe in the power of

815
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,112
Human advice and we really believe that Americans deserve access to

816
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
2 plans

817
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
And he was like What if we teamed up

818
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,256
That was now December and the next thing you know

819
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
We're signing a term sheet to be acquired on March 25th

820
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
Alexa

821
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
And you don't have to confirm this

822
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
But the reported number

823
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
About sale

824
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
What is a

825
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Order of a

826
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Billion dollar

827
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,456
When you are 14 and your your dad passed away

828
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Your mom was like so

829
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,088
Let's figure out the finances and in the finances of family which

830
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,416
Obviously created some instability

831
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,768
And that you that decision in in 2015

832
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Made you and presumably others around you

833
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Financially secure

834
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
Cure for life I mean

835
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
What does that mean to you

836
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
I mean no

837
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
I think

838
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,104
A few things in this world like a very personal story

839
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,248
That I actually told the board after we sign the document I sent them all a video of the board of Northwestern Mutual

840
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
I sent them

841
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:31,136
Now the 3-minute video is kind of surreal at the time cuz I actually didn't intend to do this but

842
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,952
It just felt right and I just went with my instincts

843
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,536
Tell my dad passed away without you in Northwestern Mutual life insurance policy

844
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Stabilize my family

845
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
And I knew the power of

846
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,448
I want Financial stability really provides to family

847
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
And I

848
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
Just send them a video and said here's why I'm doing this

849
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Here I am I

850
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,784
Having helped build this great products that helped America innovate on Financial Planning and if I can put it

851
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
In hand

852
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Of their 8000 financial planners

853
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Provide more but I felt at 14

854
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
I can really get behind that

855
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
You are in your early

856
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,584
I'm your mom you've got

857
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,680
Do you have your old and then one on the way

858
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
You you have

859
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
Like your whole your whole life is ahead of you

860
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,408
But you're an age where most entrepreneurs start their first business

861
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
And obviously right now you still have a role at

862
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
Northwestern Mutual you that

863
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Cheapest lobsters

864
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
When do you think you'll

865
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,184
You'll ever go on to do something else like what you start

866
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
A new business

867
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,560
I don't know right I kind of like to solve problems all the way through

868
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
Kind of what I care about right if I'm going to start something I want to finish it

869
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,240
I'm quite busy right now I will say that I see very very very full plate

870
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,336
Hundreds and hundreds of employees in a lot of work on my Horizon

871
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
And for me I

872
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
I like big

873
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Big meaty challenges

874
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
And I

875
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
That that's the one thing I know about myself

876
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Self self

877
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
What's next

878
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
I don't know

879
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
I've been really really honored to have lots of exciting options

880
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
Diet that I want to see things through and I still work today

881
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
You heard me ask a question before

882
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
People

883
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Ask it a question

884
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
How much of

885
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Your

886
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
Success do you think is due to your

887
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,128
Intelligence and hard work and how much how much business do to lock in circle

888
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
So I know there's all the cliches

889
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
People always exciting too much

890
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
The Locking bubble blinds

891
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
I would say

892
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Definitely not my intent

893
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
And definitely not luck

894
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
I would say it was

895
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Contributed to

896
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Incredibly powerful

897
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Team of passionate people

898
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Frankly

899
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Stop through walls

900
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
And we

901
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
Saw a better life

902
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
And for me I having had such

903
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
Traumatic experience when I was younger

904
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
What I really learned wise

905
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,088
Kind of the fragility of life in like someone that you love is really important to you as a live one second and

906
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Literally meaning

907
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Later gone

908
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
It kind of helps you just

909
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Get rid of

910
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
A lot of the

911
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
Your focus gets really clear

912
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
And in fact

913
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Did almost

914
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,400
Getting me a superpower in some way because

915
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Inow process

916
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
Things a little differently which is

917
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,592
Does really matter raven like a really big stressful stupid thing is happening

918
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,176
Are we alive are we breathing okay next

919
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,248
At some point when you shift into a perspective that like

920
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,856
They're still oxygen in your veins are still breathing the people you love are so alive like

921
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
Nothing stopping video

922
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
I think you do your best work

00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
Play something Alexa did not mention

927
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Is that a high school

928
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,544
He was a competitive diver was actually recruited to compete

929
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,592
At the division 1 level in college

930
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Even though

931
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
I don't love height

932
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,760
That said you know I've gone bungee jumping and I've gone skydiving in so I'm not like

933
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,832
As scared as your average person probably with height

934
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
I don't love them either

935
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,416
I think I just like to face fear

936
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
Please do stick around cuz it

937
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Just a moment

938
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
And hear from you

939

Gotowebinar

949
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

950
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
For how you built that

951
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,816
It's right here from Dylan Hill he's a student at UC Davis

952
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
Years ago

953
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
He co-founded a nonprofit called

954
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
Gamers gif

955
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Yeah so our biggest thing right now is

956
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Is bringing virtual reality

957
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
The headsets

958
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Two

959
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Veterans Hospital

960
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Assisted Living

961
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Facilities

962
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
People with

963
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Abilities idea goes all the way back to the fifth grade when Dylan's best friend Chris

964
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Was diagnosed

965
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
Cancer had to spend months in the hospital

966
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,048
I would visit him every single day and what I saw was my friend was no longer the kid that I knew

967
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
My solution was to bring the video games

968
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
Because I knew that those would make

969
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,008
Smile Chris eventually did get better and he and Dylan stay friends

970
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
And that experience always stuck with me

971
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
And I remember looking back on it as

972
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
While those video games really helped us

973
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,504
Anyway fast forward to senior year in high school

974
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
And Dylan is now doing volunteer work

975
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
In his spare time

976
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
But he's not all that happy with it

977
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
I volunteered at a food shelter

978
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,720
And instead of spending time with the homeless

979
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
I was in the back

980
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Packing bags

981
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
And then obviously all these things they help

982
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
But it would just wasn't rewarded

983
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,936
Dylan kept thinking about the video game

984
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
Maybe there was some way he could use them to tell people

985
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,872
Chris we're doing a little random Googling

986
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,456
And Dylan said hey I wonder what it would take to start

987
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Own Shirley

988
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,296
And we googled how to start a nonprofit in we saw

989
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
Wow this is simplified into

990
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
6 step

991
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
First make an LLC

992
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
And then skin touch with

993
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
The Franchise Tax Board

994
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:33,632
Actually some of the stuff does not sound so simple but eventually Dylan got his mom to guarantee

995
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
TD Bank account

996
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
For their nonprofit

997
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
And they became a 501 c 3

998
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,824
I think we've probably Google every single line on the tax paperwork

999
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
Because we had no idea what a lot of it meant but

1000
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
I mean we have the internet you know we can figure out anything

1001
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,320
Cancel after they got it sorted out Dylan and Chris started to raise money to buy video game

1002
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Samsung VR headset

1003
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,928
First they sold baked goods door-to-door

1004
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,744
Then they got some donations through an online service

1005
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
And by the spring of last year

1006
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,144
They were starting to visit hospitals and other places in California

1007
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
Sharing VR and games

1008
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
The children

1009
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
And adults

1010
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
So for example there was this man Dominic who's living with cerebral palsy

1011
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
And he's always wanted to drive a race car

1012
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,712
Now he's only able to communicate by moving at at up or down

1013
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:25,344
But we can put a headset on him and we can push his wheelchair around his living room and we can emulate

1014
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
Him driving a Formula 1 race car

1015
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
Right now Gamers gift has about

1016
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
20 volunteers who

1017
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
Have brought VR sets

1018
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Sore computer games to Neely

1019
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,352
40 facilities around California

1020
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,144
And they're hoping to expand

1021
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
Yeah I would love to but because you know

1022
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,264
This technology and in the time that we spent with

1023
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
People

1024
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,848
It doesn't have to be limited to a particular

1025
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
Geographical location

1026
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
And I think the communities were already serving

1027
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,760
Are the ideal communities

1028
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Especially people just

1029
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Yeah because they will never be able to

1030
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Experience

1031
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
Scuba diving

1032
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
But we can take that

1033
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,488
And there's no reason why that should be limited to

1034
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
California

1035
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Let's still in hell

1036
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584

1037
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
