11
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
Hey there we messed up

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
We made a change to our web servers that we didn't expect

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
To have any effect on podcast

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
Clearly we were wrong

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,672
And it forced a bunch of episodes in to NPR Podcast feed

16
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
Resulting in downloads

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
You didn't ask

18
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
It also made it hard

19
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
Or impossible

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,608

We are truly sorry for the

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
We fix the root cause of the problem shortly after we discovered it

23
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,848
But it's taking awhile for that fix to make it to all podcast apps

Thanks for listening

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Hey it's guy here

34
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
And you know what are the things I love

35
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Astronaut noises

36
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
What did you start at

37
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
Tell people about your idea

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
Because some people keep it a secret

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Susan Tynan

40
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,432
Check she shared her idea for framebridge with anyone who would listen and some people actually told her

41
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
Oh you know why I thought of doing the same thing

42
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,832
But Susan was the only person to actually go out and do it

43
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,928
It's an awesome story we first ran it in November of 2017 and if

44
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
She's already heard it is

45
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
It's worth a listen again

46
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Enjoy

47
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
There were days

48
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
It is possible this thing doesn't scale

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
And it's possible we want

50
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,080
We can't keep up with the order so the issue was not that you were framing them badly but there's

51
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
Oh yeah we're framing that perfectly just took too long

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
We started to see

53
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Really angry emails

54
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
People saying like

55
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
This was

56
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
DeBerry special gifts

57
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
For my grandmother's 90th birthday and you ruin

58
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
And

59
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
It felt terrible

60
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
NPR how I built this

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Show

62
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Innovators entrepreneurs

63
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Stories

64
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
And the movements

65
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
They felt

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
Gyro House

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Dispense $1,600 framing posters

68
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
And then turned her sticker shock into a more

69
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Portable idea

70
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Call framebridge

71
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
So therapy

72
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
Pieces of artwork hang up in my house that

73
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
Cost a lot less than what it cost to actually frame

74
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
You know you drive to the

75
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
Restore you get the Madden you pick

76
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
The frame glasses

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
You're down

78
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
400 bucks

79
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
And then if you're like me

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
Framing stuff you end up turning a closet in your house

81
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Do you like a

82
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Photos and artwork Storage Center

83
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:11,232
And this is exactly the opportunities about 5 years ago

84
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,048
When she starts how to make framing

85
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Cheaper and

86
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Easier

87
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Now at the time

88
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
Susan was already a veteran of a bunch of startups

89
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
Mostly failed but those experiences she figured out how to raise money to start

90
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Framebridge

91
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
But I like a lot of the companies we had on the show

92
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,088
Framebridge is still in its building base it's still working to become a sustainable company

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,440
And Suzanne is still working like crazy still starting early

94
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
And still staying late and she says she got that

95
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
Run a small business on Lake Erie in Cleveland

96
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
Tugboats meaning the little votes that helped big boats and so it really

97
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Operationally intensive business and

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Our family really revered

99
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
Providing for our family and then

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
We ate dinner at 7:30 because that's when Dad got home from work

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
That's so cool like

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
I've never

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Met anybody who

104
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Who is involved with the tugboat

105
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,327
There's something just iconic an awesome

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,959
So are you know I certainly have been on my share of tugs and I think

107
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,543
My one soda party trick when I got to be a teenager was that we were

108
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
An event downtown

109
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
And there's a tug out on the water you know my dad would have them

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Honk your horn when they went by us

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
See your dad and did you were you involved in

112
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
I mean we pinch and I remember you know if the receptionist was out would go in and answer phones for my dad and

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
We are certainly

114
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
This again like reverence for were

115
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
And what it took that it didn't come easy

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,911
Yeah I can just imagine my dad on vacations on the phone or

117
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Are the phone ringing late at night and

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
If something goes wrong and

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
In a business that operationally intensive it's really gone wrong so

120
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
I remember that

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Drama

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,943
Do you or did you grow up thinking

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,271
Entrepreneurial like I'm going to be an entrepreneur because

124
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
A jamming were around the same age and

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
I don't remember that

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
BMV Parma

127
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Culture

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
No I think it was my dad and I thought I was going to be the boss but

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
But I didn't

130
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,143
That wasn't like I'm going to be the boss and great things come with being the boss it was like and all the responsibility that comes with that

131
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
And soy

132
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,751
I guess I had that vision of a business career

133
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
He's but you said you didn't think I'm going to go to

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Vista College NM

135
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Like a lawyer

136
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
No idea

137
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
And I certainly had a lot of ideas

138
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
None of which were great like there should be a pancake delivery service

139
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
But you know what

140
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
I was always thinking along those lines always solving consumer problems

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Susan went on to study at the University of Virginia

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
And then she got a degree at Harvard Business School

143
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
She dip your toes into the

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Startup world for a little bit

145
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
And then

146
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
She went to work at the White House during President Obama's first term

147
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Battleground 2011

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
Susan once again

149
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
How to start a bug

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
So at the time

151
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Some guys I had worked with previously

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
I had started a startup

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:19,391
In a hot new space called daily deals on soda company was called living social and I

154
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Was watching them from afar

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
I was just started

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Jealous

157
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,119
Blowed it was social Groupon that was the daily deal thing and if they're still around

158
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Ndnu

159
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
Seeing friends of yours and you were thinking

160
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,847
I got to get into this I got to get on it I am so jealous like truly a joke

161
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
When when one of them called

162
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
And asked me if I wanted to join I sort of had like my desk packed up I was like I'm ready

163
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Wow

164
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Cheap a cup and you are like

165
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Great I'm going to do this and what did you do at looking at ID

166
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
I'm so

167
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
How work was he sent emails with deals to local

168
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Merchants & Shop

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
And so they decided they would do some specialty ones

170
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
Paradise Run Travel and hard meat

171
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Do anything else

172
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
So I did

173
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
You don't first

174
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Family-friendly deals and then

175
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
In-home services so like what kind of deals

176
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Yasso deals for

177
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
You don't things like Gymboree and child care services and things like that things that a family might be

178
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Be interested in apple picking

179
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
And then it was just like what else could we sell into what other group

180
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
What was that time like is ime Newsom not that long ago were talking about like

181
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
67 years ago

182
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
I mean

183
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,863
I remember LivingSocial here in Washington DC

184
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
It was

185
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
YouTube

186
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,007
It just seemed like everyone is throwing money at it what was it like working at a time

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
It was really really exciting

188
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
You know we were all relieved driven

189
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
We were all really bullish

190
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,783
We knew that speed mattered and in that case in that industry really

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
And so it was fun cuz we had to unlearn I had to unlearn some things I was coming right out of the White House I mean you had to

192
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,559
Like this email doesn't have to be checked by 10 people we just got to get it out the door and

193
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
That was exciting

194
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
It was like a gold rush

195
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
I didn't speak to you remember what LivingSocial is valued at

196
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Now a couple billion

197
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Yeah

198
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,687
Remember even the business lines I was running I got to launch when I got 280 million in sales like

199
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Get out of your house

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
So was it just insane were you working all the time

201
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Yeah I was

202
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
I was working a lot but again it was coming from a job where I work a lot so

203
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Clearly something I'm used to

204
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
And also it's funny cuz I had you know

205
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
A baby at home and it was certainly a startup

206
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
Party culture as well and I found for myself there at a certain became sore like

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Dementor aunt

208
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,663
Do a lot of people like I was where is a little bit older

209
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
When did you start to see

210
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
I don't know things at LivingSocial kind of

211
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
Turn a little bit when did you start to notice that maybe

212
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Maybe this isn't going to

213
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Work out the way

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Everyone

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Thanks I will

216
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Obviously you see

217
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Metric to see growth slowed

218
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
And it makes you start to question certain things

219
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
And then obviously you see Talent

220
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
And so when

221
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
You know some people admired started to leave

222
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Just even

223
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
Composition of the whole experience begin

224
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
Penta LivingSocial capacity

225
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
What what actually went wrong

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,207
You know I think it's a multi-part answer some of which

227
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Was

228
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
You know that

229
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
Exchange was really that local Merchants would get

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Loyal

231
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
And so that had to be the case

232
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
And I think in some cases

233
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,823
That trade-off didn't exist and so some of the best Merchants said not in

234
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Anymore and so then

235
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
Females wearing is exciting and they didn't have the best

236
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
Restaurants in stores in southern customers

237
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Speaking lessons

238
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Did the idea and so it was that

239
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,671
It when that cycle was reinforcing it was Unstoppable but when you know started to unwind

240
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
It got hurt

241
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
Did that give you an insight into

242
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Stop

243
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
A thing of

244
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
New things new technology new products new apps like I don't not to pick on Living Social or Groupon Europe

245
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,335
Neither tons of these examples where you know one day at company's value today

246
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
5 billion dollars

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
And then

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
It seems like a year later

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
It's sorta like the emperor

250
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
You know MP

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Closer

252
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Google what is actually what's the value here

253
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
Well I think no doubt it led me to a business that I could

254
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
So I think yeah I just learned

255
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
Give me some of those businesses are hard to

256
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
Hard to know whether they're going to be transformational our Fleet

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
So at what point did you decide to leave

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
So

259
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Growth was slowing and I think

260
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
More importantly I thought my personal development was slowing

261
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
And I thought you know I really

262
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
I want to run something

263
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
I just do and I always sort of just

264
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Feeling that

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,487
Were you anxious about your future

266
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
I don't think I was anxious about

267
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
My future

268
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
At that company I was anxious about my future

269
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
In general I just wanted to get on it

270
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,567
And at that time I had started to think about building my own business

271
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
I'm in and I with my head was going there when I got a job offer that sounded

272
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
Melissa Zoe

273
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Woodworking for a taxi app

274
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
It's called Taxi Magic that was actually had an iPhone app to hell.

275
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Uber

276
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
And so I thought well that was sorta scratch this is

277
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
That'll be close enough to do in Miami

278
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
But was it a well-funded startup

279
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
So at the time it was but certainly nowhere near Living Social

280
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Free snacks

281
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Oh yeah yeah

282
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Foosball the whole thing

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
You know that company

284
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,943
Sales Retreats beautiful graffiti on the walls

285
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
CTE

286
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
You were trying to convince taxi companies to adopt

287
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
Taxi Magic app or whatever and then

288
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
You would click on the app and then you can order text you that was

289
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
Align with hex magic that works exactly and how long did you do stay there

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
I wasn't there long I was there only about 7 months

291
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Because

292
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
As soon as I got there I realized

293
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,567
I really want to do my own thing that I just that feeling could not be sated

294
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
In another way

295
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Yeah and so what

296
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
What did you have to do to start a kennel

297
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
Brainstorm possible ideas did you have

298
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Idea

299
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
For a long time

300
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
I met someone should make custom picture framing better

301
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
How did you get the idea

302
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Daddy originated

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Truly back probably

304
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Eight or nine years

305
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
I had

306
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
National parks

307
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Posters

308
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
I've never had bought on his annual hiking trips out when

309
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
On with my sister

310
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
And I took them to a local frame store to be framed

311
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
The terrible experiences

312
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Really intimidating and

313
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Really expensive

314
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
Like more expensive the posters much more expensive and the framing was for

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
$400 each

316
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
You spend $1,600 on

317
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
And so you were thinking what this has to do somebody has to change this

318
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Do this again

319
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
And so

320
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,823
I just always had I like I had a mixed reaction even towards the posters when I finally picked him up three weeks later

321
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
I just thought I'd like

322
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
How did that happen to me

323
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,711
I just started going about my life and I kept noticing thing

324
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
That I would like and I have will you can have that you can frame it

325
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Chester Patterson

326
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
Because it this is I'm having flashbacks to my conversation with the Warby Parker

327
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Which it was similar because glasses are so expensive

328
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
And they were asking why I mean

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Plastic and

330
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Ghettos some hinges

331
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
It's right in Super Why

332
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Why is the framing

333
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Why am i spending so much money

334
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Sofer a local store

335
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
They don't

336
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
Store any inventory

337
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Is there any of their materials in their store

338
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
And sew in or when you go in and you select from the thousand

339
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Frame styles on the wall

340
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
The

341
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
That bring sword actually buying those

342
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Materials for your

343
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
When you

344
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Place your order

345
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Text week

346
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
And it's really heavily marked up you're buying from a distributor

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,191
So our Innovation which I doesn't seem like much of one was really like

348
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Why don't we choose frame styles We Believe are beautiful

349
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,567
Invest in them and make it centrally

350
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
So you can't so so basically you have

351
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Some options but not

352
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Not internet

353
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
40 styles

354
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
I'm rotate

355
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Driven by Trends but we don't

356
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Yeah we don't overwhelm you with a thousand Francine one

357
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
And you have the inventory

358
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Then we have

359
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
And the concept was that

360
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
That you would roll up your artwork

361
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Nail it in and then it would

362
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Come back Frank

363
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,215
Yes that was the concept the concept was for less than half the price of a retail store

364
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
With very clear upfront pricing you choose from a

365
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Beautiful selection

366
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
We mail your Packaging

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Email us your art

368
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
We send it back to you in a couple days Reddit

369
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
You're working a taxi Magic

370
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
But if you have this idea for a long time what was the

371
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Spark that actually got you

372
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
To do that to actually

373
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Believe in

374
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Make goforit multi-step

375
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
LivingSocial I sold a lot of

376
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
And so people I new customers are looking for a deal on this

377
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
This category but didn't

378
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
They still didn't like their experience

379
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
And so that

380
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Validated

381
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
And then

382
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
When I get to Taxi Magic I had

383
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
You know

384
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
How many smart people are competing in this category

385
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Can I have a category

386
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,391
I am just so eager to make better

387
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
And nobody's thinking about it

388
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
You you started to tell people about this idea because a lot of people are secretive at the beginning

389
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
I think I don't want to view my deals I'll steal it

390
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
You told people about

391
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,103
This idea you had a dead and it was essential I did because

392
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
Yeah I needed to know what people actually use

393
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
Did people think it was a good idea and I started talking to everybody.

394
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
You're truly an image of me at a cocktail party or at

395
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
You know

396
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
Ifriends baseball game and in just thinking about you know

397
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Telling people the concept in then I kept hearing the same stories about

398
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Either me or my partner

399
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
You know

400
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
And in the story was always involving $600 worth of Framing and I bet I wouldn't believe it and I do believe it that's why I'm

401
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
I'm going to fix it

402
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
But everybody present was like saying to you

403
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
What an awesome idea Susan

404
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
But like

405
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Let's just be honest here

406
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
A million conversations like that happen everyday

407
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,927
To this day at least twice a month someone says you know me and my friends we were talking and we were

408
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Coming up with that same idea

409
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
We have an idea for a framing

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,607
Company disrupting framing company

411
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Is is an idea enough

412
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,079
Yeah a lot of their lot of really awesome ideas

413
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Now and ideas

414
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Wheeling hour

415
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
I mean I so let's at least an hour sorry it's

416
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
It's worth

417
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
It's all the hustle

418
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
I mean into were you

419
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
Like financially secure enough to take this leap to actually

420
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Leave your job and try this

421
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
No

422
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
We're living a life that required

423
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Too hard working

424
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
Parents and required to salaries for Mortgage in r

425
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Two kids they were

426
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
1 and 4 at the time

427
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Two little girls and

428
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
It's obviously child care for them

429
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
So yeah it was kind of a crazy time to decide to start a business

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
And I think a lot of people

431
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
Tell me all the reasons this

432
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Couldn't work

433
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
So what was the first

434
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,327
Think me so the first thing you did as you start talking to people and tell him about the idea

435
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
And

436
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
What was the first like

437
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Concrete thing you did did you

438
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Did you know anything about Frank

439
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,751
I knew nothing about framing

440
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,335
So certain most notably a kind of for a framing course

441
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
That I took at a Hampton Inn

442
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
And

443
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
So they actually take

444
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Bring small framing

445
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Equipment into conference room

446
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Sponsored by

447
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,463
Just like somebody

448
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,791
I'm you can learn to picture frame and really the advertisement is like

449
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Look at the highest margin business

450
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,447
Come learn how to frame

451
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Learn how to frame then you can start to open a shop because

452
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Cuz the margins are so hot

453
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
And so

454
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
It was really important for me to make sure I knew

455
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
What is getting into on the production side but also

456
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Yeah they make sure it was

457
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
BECU

458
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
You leave your job to to learn how to frame

459
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
I leave my job to learn how to frame

460
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
And I go to a trade show in Las Vegas

461
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Just two

462
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,839
Just to check it out just to check it out

463
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Because I thought

464
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Yelp

465
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
What have I gotten myself into

466
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
I just whispered wandering around looking at frame styles like they actually

467
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
Add opinions on on on WhatsApp as I liked and

468
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
And had some design learnings but really I just thought like

469
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
What am I getting myself into

470
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,319
I remember standing alone on the Vegas Strip

471
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,903
Just having paid my way they're out of my own pocket

472
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,231
Thinking like what am I doing like am I ever going to pull this thing

473
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
What when was x-ray shown

474
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
In 2013

475
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Debt ratio

476
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,447
Set 2013 and in what year were there like taking notes and to just

477
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And what did you do with that information

478
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
I was still in the you let me make sure I'm not missing

479
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,503
And then also like well gosh I'm going to have to get started so I have to call these people up and tell them I want to buy a quip

480
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
And one bite you know what

481
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
Develop contacts in the industry

482
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,303
There are few folks I met their who are still vendors to this day and I really give

483
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Them credit for listening

484
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Because I do think most people just

485
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Orton

486
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Oh well

487
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Absolutely didn't

488
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,383
To this day I think I'm still trying to explain to people it was really kind of reverence for the end product

489
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
That I started this business so I actually think

490
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Getting something custom framed

491
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Really really special

492
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
And so

493
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
I believe that I just believe

494
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
More people need tax

495
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
But presumably some of these

496
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Frame folks were like

497
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
We don't want this kind of disruption we don't want

498
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
Your Harvard Business School degree to come in and make this thing cheaper for consumers

499
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
That what you can understand

500
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Of course

501
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
And so going on in building this business I have

502
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
Run into that a number of times but I think

503
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,527
It requires someone out of the industry to be able to sort of plotted from the consumer's viewpoint

504
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
And I think by this time I did felt like

505
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Too late to back out

506
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
It and so at that point I started trying to

507
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Kitchen Masters

508
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Why did you decide to go to investors

509
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
From the get-go rather than

510
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Just pull together

511
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Money from family and

512
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Anywhere you can get

513
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
A little bit here and there and

514
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah I joke a little bit that we were somewhat on lean in the beginning

515
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
In that

516
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
We Believe

517
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
I believe

518
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
That in order to actually

519
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Do this business well and had to be done it

520
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Such a high

521
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Holiday

522
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
And that was that the site had to look beautiful

523
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Packaging had to be

524
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Branded

525
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
You had to trust

526
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Awesome enough to roll up a diploma and

527
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Send it to

528
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
And I really thought like

529
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
There is no

530
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Really minimally viable

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Product version

532
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,968
Like that anything to just test whether the concept worked wouldn't

533
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
We had to do a great and we had you are so

534
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
So how did you

535
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
As you get the money to do this cuz I have to assume you need

536
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Did a lot of money to build

537
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:26,048
An app to get the materials to hire a team like YouTube how much money were you looking right yeah so

538
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
Hilarious I remember saying I was looking to raise $50,000

539
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
And initial investors saying you realize that's not going to

540
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Enough money

541
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
But you know once I really got into it

542
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,128
We raised $2000000 so we were going to raise a real round

543
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
Navigate where you like a million half dollars value

544
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
What you say that did you didn't know what to say how I didn't I didn't know any of those things and quickly learned in you learn because all them

545
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
Meeting starts assertive meld together

546
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
Anyone know things along the way but the pitch was really clear and

547
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
And when I'm really proud of we built the business

548
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Which was

549
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Wenzhou

550
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Look

551
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
I say we because there were some people on the PowerPoint

552
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Pizza Shack

553
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Who now have joint

554
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
But they were just like aspiration

555
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
So yeah it was just

556
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
Okay custom frames too expensive

557
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
And

558
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
Pretty big Market it could be way bigger

559
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
Is someone made it less expensive and less of a hassle

560
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
And here's I'm going to do it

561
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
How did you find people to even pissed

562
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
So an investor at Living Social

563
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
But I met for breakfast he was actually wondering why I had left Living Social it was just a sort of a social call

564
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
And

565
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,504
I had no business bitching him at that time cuz it was really not a strongly enough developed idea but I

566
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Told him

567
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
You know

568
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,880
I pointed it frames on the wall and said you know those should only cost $100

569
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Do you know that

570
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
And

571
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,000
Should I leaned in and said you don't you should do this

572
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
He's a really intense guy

573
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
And so

574
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
I thought well gosh that was the reaction

575
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,472
You're like validated right there yeah and so I

576
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Yeah tag Savage of rebel

577
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
So so he's aching in the Mid-Atlantic

578
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Pretty well-known investor

579
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,712
He is a well-known investor and yes

580
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
And he also calls it like

581
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
Casey's at so I knew like this is not someone who would be

582
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
Breakfast or lunch with this guy and he's like

583
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
Go for you got to do this Susan

584
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
He said that there's a good idea

585
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,120
And so great we left and about a week later

586
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
He's at me a one-line email how far along

587
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
And I thought

588
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Yes

589
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Okay

590
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
And it certainly it was not a promise of anything but it was enough to make me think

591
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
Like this is a nitrogenous we got it

592
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
I have built this

593
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
So he said pull up UPC

594
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
This Together come up with you know what are you doing next

595
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
How you get this thing off the ground and come

596
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Which this thing for real

597
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
Find a pretty good presentation I thought of

598
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Of how I would pull up

599
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
First guy to give you the money

600
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,032
Yep and I went in and I went through everything in the deck and he said

601
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
This isn't

602
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
I don't think there's enough

603
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Here

604
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
That we can make

605
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Annabelle Smith

606
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
What how does

607
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
He goes from saying go do this to saying

608
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah I don't I'm not feeling it

609
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
What it what was it that he did not

610
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Like about your

611
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
I think you didn't like the certain

612
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
Uncertainty part of it

613
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
We had

614
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,472
Yeah I had an idea that I would pull everything together but

615
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Yeah

616
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
I didn't have anything yet

617
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
And so

618
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
I think he felt like

619
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,992
I can't come back and say I found this great early stage company but they haven't done anything yet

620
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
And I remember walking home that I was

621
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
The difference I need

622
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
The cat but I walked home that night thinking like

623
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Oh my gosh

624
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Crestfallen

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
So that's done now you got to move on to the next

626
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
Yeah and by this time

627
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,984
You know I'm spending money at a trade show at a framing course out of your own pocket

628
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,128
You are not independently wealthy no longer

629
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,992
It was you looking your bank account and entering if it is a certain point where I'm going to hit a limit like

630
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
$10,000 - $20,000

631
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
Lost $30,000 and I'm going to be in big trouble

632
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah I remember actually having it

633
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Serious conversation with my sister

634
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

705
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Kyroz

706
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,360
Has first investment pitches went

707
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
Nowhere

708
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
A lot of people told her to

709
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Give up

710
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Of course she didn't cheat convinced

711
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,088
Some Engineers to help with the website for framebridge

712
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Promise that eventually

713
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
She would pay them

714
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
I really convincing Engineers like this is all happening we're going to get money so

715
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Starfield

716
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
Sebastian start Kodi

717
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
We started building

718
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Framebridge

719
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
But I mean

720
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,288
Even at that point anywhere so we're finding what the name for framebridge would be

721
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
And

722
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,944
Yeah so I started building as though it would be funded obviously anything that required a big check I couldn't

723
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Obtain

724
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,528
But otherwise certainly I could get you know

725
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
Samples of materials and things like that and so I just started

726
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Feeling as though it would happen

727
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
And

728
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Meeting anyone who might

729
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,608
Be able to write a check and just using using your own money for bits and pieces here and there my money for bits and pieces

730
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,936
But that point things starting to pick up more and I think

731
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
Again a lesson in just

732
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
If you're moving as though the business is going to work the rest is going to

733
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
So that point I had gotten connected to another investor I knew as well

734
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
National investor a

735
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
At female partner

736
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Venture Capital firm

737
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:55,744
Who and we had lunch and I told her the idea and she said you won't believe this I was

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Searching

739
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Last week

740
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
For the solution

741
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
It doesn't exist I looked for

742
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Should I love this

743
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,960
I get it I I know this need exists

744
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
And

745
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Cheating

746
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
It wasn't that easy

747
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,176
It was definitely a series of meetings in sort of a show me how you're putting this

748
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Is together

749
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,552
The same way with a lot of like blue show me more in the next time you show me more

750
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
And so she was the first chat

751
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
It's actually sign

752
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,928
And a how long did the process of when you started

753
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
To raise money to when you ask you raise the millionaire million and a half that you needed how long did that

754
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
Meetings wise it was

755
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
You know

756
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
10 months

757
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
Really intensely probably about 4

758
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Felt

759
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Really grueling but I think is

760
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
You know as these things go through an EZ run

761
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
That's fast yeah 4 months

762
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
So you have

763
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,224
Like a little over million bucks in your hand

764
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
In your bank account you're looking at those zeros

765
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
What do you do with that money

766
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,136
First thing I did was hire my first

767
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Employee

768
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
I'm a woman and Tessa who would work for me

769
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Previously

770
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,816
And so truly the day the wires hits

771
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
She quit her job in

772
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
And what you do

773
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Everything

774
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,496
Everything is like runs merchandising and creative but I mean we did

775
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Everything we

776
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
Began actually doing a lot of products and

777
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,224
So we were sitting in this co-working space and we are getting these boxes of

778
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,808
Mount wood chips wood mouldings being sent to us

779
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
We shouldn't really go and I

780
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
Every night you know you have to bring your butt

781
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Leave with your boxes

782
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
And so we would Uber home at night with boxes of

783
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
Example materials but we just started

784
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
Again doing everything on all fronts like meeting with packaging vendors meeting with UPS like it was just a

785
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
In hindsight I don't even know what that work plan look like but we were just reviewing every single thing at 1

786
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
And what was the plan like with that with that seed money

787
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,808
The plan was to build a NASA website and

788
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Launch

789
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:01,440
Yeah so the plan was to build an app and a website and to find some framer friends

790
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
To do the initial production

791
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,536
And remember we had for the first 9000 frame

792
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't know why we said that for the first time. Just find someone who'll do it outside frame company

793
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Okay

794
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
And I think that was a way to get our initial investors

795
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Comfortable with the fact that we were

796
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
Add no experience on that manufacture

797
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:24,992
Ringside but you had to find a framing company that would do this but they were expensive right so we didn't

798
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,064
So we started talking to

799
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,648
Yelp framers in to see if we get them interested in what we're doing and

800
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
We realized

801
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
I took a lot of questions like

802
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,328
We couldn't control quality we wouldn't be certain about anything and both of us

803
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,960
Sticklers for for quality for precision and we just did that

804
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,544
Do we realize in order to even buy materials

805
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
We would need a warehouse

806
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
And so

807
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
We need a warehouse we might as well get framing equipment

808
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
And we might as well

809
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Make the very first

810
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
And so had to tell her investors like

811
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Congratulations

812
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
You're going to own a frame fact

813
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
And we drove around

814
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,744
The DC metropolitan area which is really an area known for

815
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Industrial spaces

816
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
But we found a space

817
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
And started building

818
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
So you ordered like

819
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Equipment to make frames

820
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Which I guess is like

821
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
Play band saws and I would like Willie Wood

822
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Did you get so we actually

823
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,152
Had a guy through our travels we met a vendor who said

824
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
You've talked to this guy who sells used equipment

825
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,808
And he's a great guy on death frame store and said like a Moonlight for you guys

826
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
And help you get this

827
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,184
And how did you tell him to take like from the time you get your investment

828
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
The time you rescued launch

829
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Set up the website.

830
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
And the app how long does that take

831
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,960
We got money end of February by April we signed a lease on the facility

832
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Production facility

833
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
And July

834
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
We did a sawfly

835
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
Yeah it was but I mean

836
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:02,272
We felt under pressure I mean we had it again a lease for a warehouse and not a funk

837
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Ring website

838
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Elise for warehouse

839
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
You up with you paying rent on

840
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,488
And wear your investors like okay guys come on clocks ticking yeah they definitely were I think every week

841
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Pre-launch

842
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,632
Belts carry what from an investor perspective and fungus and unknown

843
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
I mean this was just a real

844
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,288
Field of Dreams right this was a i bad customers really want this service

845
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Until we launch

846
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
We wouldn't

847
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
Launch in July of 2014

848
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
How do you get the word out

849
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,160
Right so hilariously we started with me it was a password protected site cuz we didn't want to be overrun

850
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,816
I'm which was not to be a worry so we launched with with that little beta site in July and then August we opened up and

851
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
I told her everybody when you on Facebook

852
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
Got a couple orders

853
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
But they were all Serta you know

854
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,080
One degree of separation to degree of separation I went to college with that guy type thing

855
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,384
And so we started to send out for him

856
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
TED Talks

857
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
The Press

858
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
And

859
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,760
First couple months we got

860
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Two big hits architectural digest and in

861
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
You just friend

862
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
Like random sings insensitive

863
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
We were like

864
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
What exact

865
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Wakaliwood

866
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
What frame style would this

867
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Editor and this Maga

868
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Is Ian like

869
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
What is something about their life we can figure out

870
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
Interesting young we were really thoughtful

871
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
And those those were really validate

872
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
What about you

873
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
And

874
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Did that have a measurable

875
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Impact

876
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Show in Arabic

877
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248
At that point we were selling so few anything with measurable

878
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
So is measurable

879
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
But everything sort of manageable

880
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Every time we had said like

881
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Will really be coming in for selling a thousand frames

882
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
And we had told her head of production

883
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Be prepared

884
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,608
And he was in the framing industry and he was like good luck girls like you. Get two thousand francs a month

885
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,496
And that was true of the first month or two and then late October

886
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:04,384
Someone a home decor blogger wrote a blogpost and we had our first real sales bike

887
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,712
And that was the first day without okay

888
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Like it's on

889
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
How many

890
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
Orders were you getting in a day

891
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
So at that point we were probably would felt

892
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
Overwhelming we're probably getting in 50 years

893
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,048
The for folks who worked in production we're making the frames

894
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
But

895
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:27,168
B team of us who were not making the website and marketing everything where the shipping

896
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,216
So at 4 p.m. every night

897
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,544
We pushed aside our laptops and walk to the back of the factory

898
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
And bubble wrap

899
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Package.

900
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
Including you the CEO better believe it

901
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
You are you are like

902
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Wrapping up and

903
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
You better believe it I had I truly remember

904
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,672
An early board meeting I was on the phone and I thought oh my gosh they don't know that my hands are covered in

905
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
Paper cuts like they don't get it it was just

906
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
A level of all hands on deck

907
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,632
Trek Continues okay but we are approaching our first holiday

908
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
And

909
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
This guy this part-time had a production came in one night and said this was an earlier

910
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Too much stress

911
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,552
Yeah I started didn't sign up for this thought I'd get you guys started but I don't need this

912
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
And

913
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
I said that we're about to hit our first holiday and things are picking up like I need you

914
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
I don't need all this with us

915
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,888
This is the guy who's running the brexit

916
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Timeout

917
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
And you said

918
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,616
Well I'm not sure I can say what I said no I think I tried to appeal with the light

919
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,408
Please don't let me down

920
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,480
But there was really sure that he really would like I just

921
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,296
I took you this far

922
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
You freaking out

923
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,536
You know you do everything and so that was one of the you know they're probably a dozen times or you say like

924
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,328
Is it the end of the end

925
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Yeah yeah

926
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
And I've been using about everyone in like your investors who believed in you and then you believed in this guy who said I'll just work part-time and

927
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
That was fine and how did we get into this

928
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
So what you do

929
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:16,736
Don't I immediately called a friend who would work in operations for LivingSocial

930
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
And doki

931
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,064
Put me in touch with another colleague of ours so

932
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
You don't miss

933
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
Mutual friend colleague

934
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm with in between gigs and said this will be funny I can do this I can learn

935
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,280
Tie me up and so truly within 2 days

936
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
We had a new

937
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Hadoop production

938
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
I'm who had

939
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
No experience in warehouse but was

940
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,264
And how long they take like 2 or 3 days

941
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
And he knew how to make friends

942
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:46,432
No but he was sufficiently ID and and really thought it would be fun

943
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
He just said like I can do this and we knew I mean

944
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Yes

945
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,576
Super nice and super smart and

946
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Day three he breaks his leg

947
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
In the factory

948
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
So I was like

949
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Okay well we're out again

950
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
And so then

951
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
We just started

952
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
That the four of us

953
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
That Regional

954
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Corporate team had to just stand in and

955
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
And figure it out at that point

956
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
He came back on crutches and we got through our first holiday

957
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,384
So you guys make it feel like Christmas and then

958
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
I just couple months later you hit

959
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,224
I'll take another crisis right

960
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Yeah

961
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,552
We did a really clever Father's Day from

962
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
Commotion

963
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:27,648
Where we asked about this style of your dad and head

964
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Uniqlo

965
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
Craft paper designs if you had a preppy dad or

966
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Hipster dad

967
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,560
I was really clever marketing but

968
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
Broker Factory basically

969
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Adjust required

970
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Did they match

971
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,032
Not only all the components of a custom frame but also the right craft paper

972
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
And we started to slip into

973
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
A production

974
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
What what how many orders did you get

975
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,248
So we started was really the daily issue and that we were

976
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,576
Telling about a hundred rain today in making about 70

977
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
And

978
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,416
When we got into this Father's Day back login

979
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
That's something diverse

980
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Summer

981
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
There were days

982
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
It is possible this thing doesn't scale

983
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
And it's possible we won't dig ourselves out it won't scale because you you start to realize we cannot keep up with the orders

984
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:20,128
We can't keep up with the order I mean that's a good problem to have yeah it felt like a good problem to have except we were also

985
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,432
Oriented to customer Delight

986
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
We started to see

987
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
Yeah really angry emails people saying like

988
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
This was the very special gift

989
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,928
For my grandmother's 90th birthday and you ruined it

990
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
And

991
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
It felt terrible

992
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
And I remember

993
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
Having this really intense debate about do we send the email to customers who think it's going to come in 3 to 4 days but says it's going

994
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Two to three weeks

995
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,800
So the issue was not that you were framing them badly but there's

996
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,384
Oh yeah we're framing that perfectly just took too long

997
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
I'm an answer that leads to the bigger

998
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
Can we get out of where we are today and

999
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Can this thing

1000
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
Cuz you need to confer to work

1001
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
It has to be as convenient

1002
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
Quick as going to like

1003
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,743
Your local frame story has to be quicker our customers

1004
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
Charter internet Choppers they care about

1005
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
They're and Tuesday they're getting ready for something they're doing

1006
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
Saturday in

1007
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
Tell me how you how you were sort of organizing your

1008
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Life

1009
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Because I'm imagining

1010
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
You got to talk to your investors

1011
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
You're bored

1012
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,687
You got a Brazilian emails coming in

1013
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
You're also like running the staff

1014
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
What did you save everyone is like

1015
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
Screen and tear your hair out

1016
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
Yeah I remember

1017
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
Hosting a board meeting

1018
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,511
I'm at our production facility it a like a rented

1019
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Conference room nearby

1020
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,655
Cuz I thought maybe I should bring them in on this backlog issue and they should actually

1021
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
Take a tour of the facility and see what's going on

1022
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
You don't Maybe

1023
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,031
In this case honesty is the best policy

1024
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,407
So I remember touring with them and they saw these like numbers on the board like let me get this straight

1025
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,479
You have that many yet to build in your building this many a day

1026
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
I got

1027
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
That math is

1028
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Isn't going to add up

1029
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
And so

1030
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
I adapt when I just had to

1031
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
You can't

1032
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
Yeah run two truths you have to

1033
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Yeah

1034
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
Bring everybody in with what you're dealing

1035
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
How did you solve the problem

1036
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
We heard a lot more framers we got a talented

1037
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
Add a production operation

1038
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
And who knew how to dig us out

1039
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,751
Really it required all of us just give up

1040
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Weekends for a couple months

1041
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
To get out of it

1042
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
I remember one conversation where I said you know

1043
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
We're not going down like this

1044
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,783
And a woman who runs product for us that we're not

1045
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
And so I was like okay

1046
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
We sealed that

1047
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
When I go down like this

1048
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
I really was thinking

1049
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
I once read that like

1050
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
How fast

1051
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
You can drop off

1052
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,583
I'm a burpee is correlated with your life expectancy

1053
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
And I think that's a lot like

1054
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,959
It's really how bad like oh

1055
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
The production

1056
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Manager quit

1057
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
We got a new production

1058
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
You like it's like that as fast as you can

1059
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
God

1060
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
When did you start to

1061
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
CDOT the light at the end of the tunnel

1062
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
We had sort of a

1063
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Euphoric

1064
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Next

1065
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
So how many seasons really big for us

1066
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
App for uploading digital photos to I mean edit

1067
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
The great is he gay

1068
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
So with Bigsby

1069
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
Holidays and so

1070
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,631
I think once we had

1071
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,447
A professional operations team

1072
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
And we lived through that crazy

1073
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,311
Spike of a holiday season we realize like

1074
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
Zofran Bridges is

1075
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
3 years in now

1076
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
Is it is it like smoother sailing

1077
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
With the company or do you still have prices

1078
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
Now wait there's always a crisis

1079
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
What would

1080
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
It's always what you didn't see coming

1081
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
So I'm relatively

1082
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
Bentley the beginning of this year we were raising more money in

1083
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
Assertive at this stage in a in a

1084
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
Then towards cuz it's your job well done with business here and so I had spent months on the road talking to investors include

1085
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Putting my own and

1086
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Stitch together

1087
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
A round of funding

1088
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
And I had been told I was to receive a term

1089
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
The finding

1090
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
The next day it was

1091
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Tuesday weather

1092
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
So where does that Monday and I

1093
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,671
New Tuesday I was getting intermittent starting to feel a little bit of relief

1094
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
My job is to

1095
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Think strategically

1096
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
Focus on the customer portal to keep the business

1097
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
And so

1098
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Was feeling good I was doing my job

1099
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
We had a brand-new CFO

1100
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,007
He was 3 weeks and on the job and we were talking that

1101
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
Monday night

1102
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
And he said you know you're going to kill me

1103
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
Navigation

1104
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
We got to get this thing closed

1105
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
And he said that

1106
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
I got another job

1107
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
What

1108
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Yeah 3 weeks every week set

1109
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,391
So whatever works for a business knows that people watch

1110
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,743
Cuz I mean you're like what's going on there if you're see about leave so I

1111
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Immediately newline

1112
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
She's going to Spook the hell out of everybody

1113
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Turn trouble

1114
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Yes

1115
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Most importantly is going to

1116
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
These investors

1117
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
And so my first thought was

1118
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Shut up

1119
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Why did you tell me that

1120
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,455
Because it's one thing to leave but like if you leave me right now I have this knowledge

1121
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
And a half

1122
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
And so

1123
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,671
His credit had been in the running for public Company CFO job really big job is his dream job those things happen

1124
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
The time just could not have

1125
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
So

1126
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,887
I left the building like a ghost I remember couple colleagues asked me about minor things and I like couldn't even answer them

1127
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
I went for a run

1128
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
Sodalite

1129
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,823
What do I do I just get the term sheet close the funding and then say ah surprise

1130
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
This guy is leaving

1131
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
But you can't

1132
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
When answered

1133
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
Just heard a frantically called

1134
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,551
All the members of my board to try and get out ahead of what I knew would be

1135
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Pili

1136
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
It's sort of an explosion

1137
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Wish it was

1138
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
They reacted by saying

1139
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
A mix of things

1140
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
This is really bad you know that yes

1141
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:02,399
We'll get through it by the way that you that you are trying to

1142
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,471
It's a lot of money it's a lot of money on the line and so you can

1143
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
You know

1144
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
People

1145
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
I want to believe $79 is going to

1146
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
A good company you can't blame them

1147
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,039
Then I remember I'll never forget a one of her

1148
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:24,671
Board members he said always on vacation but I'll try and call you and he called me and I could hear a steel drum band in the background

1149
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
And he said

1150
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,791
We're just going to have to do so well disguised

1151
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
And I said okay

1152
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
You're right that's what we're going to do

1153
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
And so then they said everyone

1154
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
Started to come around but I had to do sort of like

1155
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Yeah Sports Psych

1156
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
With everybody

1157
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:45,407
Wait to say like come on you believe in this business you believe in me we got this we're going to do this this can throw us off

1158
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
I mean I really had to like

1159
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
Bring everybody together like it was the beginning of

1160
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
The company

1161
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
And so you got the money

1162
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,903
And we live to fight another day

1163
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,487
What's the difference between your company in so many times

1164
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,303
You're still in the thick of it

1165
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
You are not

1166
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Like

1167
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Able to just sit back up

1168
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
Where is the throat

1169
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
Yeah like what's going to happen

1170
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,079
Men with their major competitors like are they going to try and lunch stuff we're doing probably

1171
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
You know what we get to be a sustainably

1172
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Yashow healthy business

1173
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,271
Yeah it looks like it but you know but it's really

1174
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Require certified Commando crawl

1175
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
Uninstall crazy amount of work

1176
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
All the time

1177
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,231
Yeah it's a crazy amount of work all the time like I said they're just

1178
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
So many talented people now to share it

1179
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
But

1180
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
I can't help myself like I

1181
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Do always want to be

1182
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
Skimming

1183
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
No customers

1184
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Four tickets and things like that

1185
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
How much do the

1186
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Point of view race

1187
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
Lee Priest 37 million dollars

1188
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
Meet at some point all these investors

1189
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:57,599
Oh yeah they want something they want something back and so they're going to either and their two options recital you go public

1190
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Or you sell to somebody else

1191
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
The only options

1192
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Likely

1193
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,583
Do I think we can be a big enough company to go public

1194
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,983
Absolutely anything read me a fundamentally good enough company to it and understandable and Evan a forecast of Alaska business to go public

1195
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
I believe that

1196
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
I also believe

1197
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,615
All of those things that make us interesting

1198
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
Would make us interesting

1199
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
As a partner of another business

1200
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,855
Does it I mean obviously you couldn't do what you've done without those invest

1201
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
That money

1202
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,695
What does any part of you kind of think

1203
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
I wish I could figure out how to do this

1204
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Without

1205
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,351
Taking a money yeah I've given up a tremendous amount of ownership biting people

1206
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Shocked by how much

1207
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
So at some point

1208
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
I bet I'll reflect on that but

1209
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,871
Really I think a lot about the fact that I don't think it would have worked unless we had done it in this really

1210
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,943
It's really high quality way and

1211
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
The money allow me to recruit

1212
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,527
Truly the best

1213
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Terrific people

1214
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
And used very good materials and

1215
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:09,279
You don't have a very open liberal return policy and everything that has to go into

1216
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,863
Building a great company and I just don't think I could have done in another way

1217
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
I think a lot of people

1218
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,471
People here 37 million dollars in inches

1219
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
Assume that you have 37

1220
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Billion dollars

1221
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
But

1222
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
Give me a heart that is that that's not the case right

1223
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
No not the highest paid member of the team

1224
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,551
So that is interesting I think that's very confusing to people

1225
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
There's a lot of

1226
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,159
This thing is real we employ a lot of people

1227
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,999
We are growing really rapidly those are real

1228
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
Not like

1229
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,327
Swimming in money and throwing it up in the air

1230
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
No

1231
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
That is a funny thing

1232
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
We still have

1233
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,471
You know cash-strapped conversation

1234
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
YouTube to friends of yours just

1235
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Assume that you're like

1236
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,639
Rolling in cash yeah I laughed cuz I started to get a lot of things from like all the

1237
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
The schools I went to

1238
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:02,783
A lot of Lego

1239
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
But the thing is is that there's a very hyper

1240
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
Possibility you will this will make

1241
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Thank you very rich

1242
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
If this turns out

1243
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,023
The way your investors imagine you imagine

1244
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
I can make you into a very rich person how important

1245
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Right

1246
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
It sounds

1247
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
Cute but I cannot be my focus

1248
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,079
It truly if I take my eye away from the ball at all

1249
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
On what we're delivering

1250
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
It will

1251
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Just like

1252
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
Has to be far away the hardest thing you've ever done

1253
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
Oh it is so hard

1254
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
I laugh about

1255
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
I work a lot of startup

1256
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
Like that has nothing to do

1257
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,255
It is not it is like barely even pepper

1258
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
For this

1259
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
It is

1260
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Extremely hard

1261
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
I mean it's just

1262
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
It's like

1263
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,911
I almost think like

1264
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,495
Come at me like I have any merging

1265
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,079
It's so much stronger like I'd like you to throw anything

1266
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,431
As soon as I know that you guys are still in the in the building mode

1267
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
And face of the company

1268
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,807
This is a question that I asked you to pretty much everyone on the show which is

1269
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,391
Do you think that so far you know

1270
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,927
Your success in this

1271
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
Success of framebridge is

1272
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Because of your

1273
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Hard work and intelligence or

1274
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Or is a lot of it just like

1275
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,887
Yeah of course a lot is locked

1276
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,679
Truly Almighty early team

1277
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
Spock from different jobs

1278
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
And so

1279
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
A lot was

1280
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
Being able to

1281
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,943
Really pull at everything together and then like I said it's really a wine zero datalattice luck

1282
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
But a lot is hustle and I think

1283
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
I think a lot about the intersection

1284
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
I guess blocking

1285
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Belief

1286
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,183
I believe in this idea I believe that I could do it

1287
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,767
I still believe it will be a big business and I think that

1288
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Translate salak

1289
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
I'm so light is like I just believe

1290
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Enough

1291
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,983
You know one thing we don't always talk about it on the show is just the amount of personal sacrifice

1292
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
It takes two

1293
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
Build a company right like

1294
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
Pinotage

1295
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Time

1296
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,175
Spent away from your partner or your kids your family and

1297
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
Probably haven't taken

1298
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,527
You know a lot of vacations over the past 2 years

1299
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
It is still worth it

1300
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
Oh Absalom

1301
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Absolutely

1302
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
And it's really

1303
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
It's the

1304
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,839
People understanding this dream part that's worth it it really is

1305
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,655
Walking through our facilities and seeing what people frames

1306
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Like that is just amazing it's like

1307
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,543
I believed you had this stuff and you did

1308
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,895
And so a truly I'll see someone and I'll have like a scarf from the running of the bulls

1309
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
That passes from

1310
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
Disney World am I

1311
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
Like I believe

1312
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,623
You wanted to bring that stuff and you got it you understood what we did

1313
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,951
And you're doing it with us and that is just a citrus at 3

1314
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:54,047
What is the most unusual thing that you've been asked

1315
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
Sweet dreams a lot of unused

1316
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Usual things

1317
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
We did frame

1318
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
A ponytail which Wisconsin

1319
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
But

1320
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
Butcher

1321
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
You know we're up for anything

1322
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,663
My favorite actually won one of my favorite

1323
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
What is a

1324
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
Cardboard

1325
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,831
Piece of a kid's fort and I had the rules of the fort on it

1326
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
And

1327
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:23,487
These kids when they were young and the mom and saved it and bring it for them when they were in their early 20s

1328
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
Now they're framed

1329
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,815
Rules of the fort but they were really

1330
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Really endearing

1331
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Be kind

1332
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
Like the rules were really

1333
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
It was like the way you should be

1334
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:39,359
And I'm in the mom wrote us a note saying you know any kids get iPhones I think of him every

1335
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
And this

1336
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
Like what hands down

1337
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
The best of Christmas

1338
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
And so I was like

1339
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
You get it

1340
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,903
That's Susan Tynan founder of framebridge

1341
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
If you don't we kept mentioning the amount of money she's raised

1342
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
37 million dollars

1343
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,071
Book that was almost 2 years ago

1344
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,703
We just check back with Susan and she says framebridge is now raised about 82 million dollars

1345
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,519
And that First Investors he pitched

1346
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
Tige Savage Revolution Ventures

1347
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,943
The one who encouraged her to start the company and then told her he wasn't ready to invest

1348
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:20,575
Well he did change his mind he actually invested framebridge and every subsequent round

1349
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
And today

1350
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,135

Hey thanks for sticking around because

1364
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:13,055
Now for how you built that and today we're updating the story we first ran about a year ago

1365
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,383
In the story begins in South Florida where land Testa grew up

1366
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,247
Every year Lin and his family would pile into the minivan to go to Disney World

1367
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
And he loved it but

1368
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,439
Like everyone else he hated waiting in those long lines the summer before I went to graduate

1369
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
School

1370
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,535
I took a trip to Disney World with my twin sister

1371
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,655
And we waited for two hours in line for this ride called The Great Movie Ride

1372
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
I was baking in the Florida Sun I thought to myself you know my God there's got to be a better way to do this and in fact there was

1373
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
Is a better way to do this and let the right guy to figure it out because he was going to graduate school to stay

1374
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
Study computer science

1375
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,111
And I went to my thesis advisors and they said I want to write a computer program

1376
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
That solves this problem and soul in decided to do his entire Master thesis on base

1377
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,839
The most efficient way to visit Disney

1378
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,447
Yeah the first paper I ever wrote was 1997 this is 10 years before the iPhone

1379
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,287
I said you know one day we're going to walk through Park and we're going to have use hand-held devices

1380
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,687
GPS and something's going to be feeding at the wait times that arise and it will optimize your route azure

1381
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:29,087
You're walking through the algorithm that would help people breathe through Disney base

1382
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,135
Based on how busy the rides were at

1383
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Any given moment

1384
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,767
And when the iPhone eventually came along when turned that program

1385
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,815
Intuit app utility app

1386
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,655
The ride you want to ride in the show you want to see in the meals that you want to eat

1387
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
And the Apple tell you the order in which

1388
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
You should do those things to minimize your wait in line lens at first came out about 8 years ago and

1389
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:58,271
I actually stumbled across it and his company touring plans with I was planning my own family's trip to Harry Potter

1390
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
World so

1391
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,975
So I have to tell you I downloaded this this thing and it work amazing we would have been stuck for like hours

1392
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:13,375
And is that pretty typical how much time can like an average family save if they use the app so

1393
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:19,775
On a busy day we can save you for hours in line pretty easily

1394
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:26,175
I'm in a situation very often where I'm driving home and then ways is like milk with make a right turn here and then

1395
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
I'm going to like the wind East Suburban Street and like what I noticed they're like four cars behind me

1396
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,647
They're also using Waze and I'm like this is

1397
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:42,047
This is the ways of vacation now it's writing so what happens when everybody at the park is using your app does it stop

1398
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:47,167
Saving you time right so we thought about that early on and here's what we do we know

1399
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:52,799
When were sending people to each ride and we know how many people eat right can handle in a given hour

1400
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:59,199
What say you would send you a dumbbell with noon and we know that it takes about 3 seconds for download a handle every

1401
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:05,599
Person in line and you and your family of four to Dumbo we will add 12 seconds to the wait time

1402
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:11,999
So that the next family gets whatever the wait time was possible seconds and we're constantly adjusting that truck today

1403
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:16,607
Is free but the company makes money by charging a $15 subscription

1404
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:21,983
Other specialized data about when to visit Disney parks and how to map out your trip

1405
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:28,383
Recently when was able to take the technology from his app and spin it into another company

1406
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,967
That helps patients with diabetes figure out what drugs they should take

1407
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
Meanwhile you expect touring plans will make about 1 and 1/2 million dollars this year

1408
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,183
I mean people overtime I have the greatest job in the world

1409
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975

1410
