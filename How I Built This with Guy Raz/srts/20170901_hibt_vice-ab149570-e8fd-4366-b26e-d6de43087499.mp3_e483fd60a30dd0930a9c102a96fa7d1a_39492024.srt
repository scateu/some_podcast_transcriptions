Completely freaked out with a friend of mine all who else went to meetings

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
And I was scared

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,176
And because I didn't know what I was doing and he said

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
What have you got to lose

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
He said maybe it'll be

24
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
Like one magazine that you make

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,184
And you can go around and say hey I made this magazine and then you can apply for a job and get a job somewhere

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Money is alive

72
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
I was

73
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
Born in Toronto and my parents emigrated

74
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688

For a while

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And so I ended up going to high school

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Vim States

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
So

85
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
I heard a lot of you have to work

86
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Twice as hard as white

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Going to get anywhere in this world grown up

00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah

91
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
What what did they want you to

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Well the two

93
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Feels that are most respected

94
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296

00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576

Medicine or engineering

97
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648

00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
You know in an Ideal World

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464

I was not a good student I originally went into psychology I got kicked out of that program ended

106
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Getting a degree in philosophy

107
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
It was a

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Tough

109
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Slot guide

110
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Come from no small

111
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Private school in

112
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
Minneapolis Road high school and

113
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Going to Galveston

114
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Different distractions

115
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
In Montreal and that's a

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Place where you can buy

117
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
You can hit a low point right

118
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Yeah

119
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
That's where I

120
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Bottomed out

121
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
When I

122
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
You know finished Miguel it was

123
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Also with a

124
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Full-blown heroin habit

125
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
And so

126
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
I spent a couple years afterwards kind of looking for a geographic

127
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Bouncing around jumping

128
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
From City to City

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
From snout with me

130
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
It's here the city this environment its

131
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Just to decadence

132
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Blah blah blah

133
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
So I ran around

134
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
And

135
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
No matter where I went

136
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
I kind of took it with me

137
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Thumbs up in Eastern Europe and even there in a remote part of Slovakia

138
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Was able to

139
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
Stay strong out for upwards of five years and

140
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Ended up back in grad school Toronto

141
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Studying psychology

142
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
And I dropped out

143
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
And that's when I really was like

144
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
You know descending in the talespin

145
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,943
Heading bottom and when I end up back in Montreal it was

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
To go to rehab

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991

149
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
I couldn't

150
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
I couldn't sustain it anymore

151
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
I couldn't

152
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Keep the

00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah there was this got a double life

156
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
I've been waiting

157
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
No no one really knew

158
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
That I was

159
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Heroin addict

160
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Your friends

161
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
I got my parents are

162
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Conservative Muslim

163
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Immigrants

164

But Progressive

165
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
As well

166
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
As far as Pakistani immigrants go

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
But they thought I had the

168
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
They didn't know the

169
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Tenth of what

170
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
What's going on

171
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
With me and when they found out

172
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
My mom went to bed

173
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Depression my brother wanted to kill me my dad

174
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Had a heart attack

175
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
I don't know if that the heart attack was directly related but I don't think it helped

176
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
It was bad it was a really bad time and

177
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
So my mental state

178
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
At the time was

179
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Was not good at I did go into a bit of a

180
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
Depression at that point I went I had to go to rehab twice

181
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
The first time it didn't

182
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Stick and

183
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
They found out that I was using again

184
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
And

185
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
It's the only time in my life that my mom never hit me

186
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
And at that point I remember that

187
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
It was my bottom

188
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
So it's like early 94

189
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
On the waiting list to get into a treatment center

190
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
No friends no

191
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815

192
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,167
Kind of Dino kicking dope in my parents house on a waiting list to get a new treatment center like

193
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Life is not great at that point

194
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
How long does it take you before you

195
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
You started to assert

196
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Steel like you

197
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Or regaining control over

198
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Black I came out of

199
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
The treatment center and I was so scared that I was

200
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Relapsing

201
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Just like I was going to meetings this going to

202
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
NA meetings

203
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
The time

204
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
Yeah they say you should go to 90 meetings in 90 days when

205
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
Stop drinking or doing drugs and and I was going to like two meetings a day

206
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
I got my own little apartment in Montreal

207
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Was on welfare and I just

208
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,423
What are my bike from meeting to meeting all day everyday and it was

209
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
During

210
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
That time that I actually started thinking

211
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
About

212
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
What I wanted to do with the rest of my life and

213
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
I had this idea that I wanted to work for a magazine

214
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
And you wanted to write about like what

215
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Like music

216
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
A culture or lie

217
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Like what will

218
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
I didn't get that far

219
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Something I felt like

220
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
That I want to do

221
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
Talk about those things yes music culture

222
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
I felt like there was

223
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
A lot happening that wasn't being talked about when I picked up magazine

224
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Depraved underground culture that that I was obsessed with was not being covered properly in the alt-weekly

225
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,359
What's it like a realistic possibility could you just go in and work for me

226
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Magazine or orange

227
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
No I don't think so I had no experience doing it my only

228
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Writing that I've ever done was

229
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Academic

230
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
You're writing in University

231
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
And when I was going to these meetings in Montreal

232
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Someone came up to me

233
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
An out-of-the-blue they started a conversation with me

234
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
And they said you have a sponsor I said no

235
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,911
And they said well I'll be your sponsor in a random dude

236
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
Walked up to me yesterday

237
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
He was in the meeting with me the meeting ended and he came up to me

238
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
He said what are you what are you doing like are you working I said no I'm not working I can't even get a job volunteering anywhere ID

239
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
I tried to volunteer at this

240
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Wouldn't let me

241
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
And

242
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Out of the blue he said have you ever thought about writing

243
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
He didn't know me

244
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,999
I was like actually yeah and he's like well I know a place I'll take you there tomorrow

245
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,607
So he took me to this place these Haitians in Montreal who

246
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
Had a a bilingual magazine going

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,287
Call damaj Intercultural it was becoming French only and they want to start an English magazine

248
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
And he vouched on my behalf

249
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
This is the guy you want he's really good

250
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
He worked there before but he was like this

251
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
This is heaven-sent Angel who just was like

252
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
Put in my path and it opens up a whole conversation about like

253
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,863
Do I believe in God do I believe in a higher power. I believe in Allah all this kind of stuff

254
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
For me that whole story is like the

255
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Proof of existence

256
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
This moment for me in my life

257
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
Something greater than me to put me

258
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
There in this place where this guy just

259
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Walked up to me and shows me to talk to me

260
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,599
And happened to know a place that was looking for a guy to start an english-language magazine in Montreal

261
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
Exactly

262
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,327
So what was the magazine called and how did it start

263
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
So so I went in for this meeting and he vouched for me and said that he don't be long time that I was going to work really hard I didn't have

264
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
A lot of experience but that

265
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
He thought I could do this thing and day

266
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
They said okay and they gave me a desk a fax machine a phone and a computer

267
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
I started this process of

268
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
You know

269
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Making a magazine

270
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Panda

271
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Alright voice of Montreal

272
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Is the name that I came up with at the time

273
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
And I had no idea what I was doing I just

274
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
But I knew a few people around town and

275
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,119
Started this kind of recruitment process of finding writers to write in the magazine and

276
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
And I remember walking down the street

277
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Completely freaked out with a friend of mine and I was scared

278
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
And because I didn't know what I was doing and he said

279
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
What have you got to lose

280
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
He said maybe it'll be

281
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
You know like one magazine that you make

282
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,319
Can you can go around and say hey I made this magazine and then you can apply for a job and get a job somewhere

283
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Or maybe it'll be huge

284
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
And like that

285
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Conversation

286
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
On the street that was

287
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
A huge moment for me because I gave me the kind of strength

288
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
To continue on when I was

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,935
Like overwhelmed could barely tie my shoes thread coming out of the treatment center like

290
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
That was a mess

291
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
And I owe him a lot because he

292
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Realize what he's doing

293
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
The time but he gave me this

294
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Strength to

295
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Keep marching forward

296
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
So you get to the magazine what like

297
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
What kind of

298
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Publication was it

299
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
It was a 16-page newsprint bags

300
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
But you were like that the kind of really like the

301
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Poor poor stepchild

302
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
The two big all week

303
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Like you guys were

304
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
We were the laughing

305
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Because it was a shrinking English Market

306
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
So it's you

307
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Mitchell bilingual City

308
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
So there are four

309
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
All Weekly's already to French ones into English ones

310
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
And then we came on the scene in the English Market is actually shrinking

311
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
There wasn't enough

312
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Advertising

313
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
To sustain those to let alone the third one

314
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
It didn't

315
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Make any

316
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Economic sense

317
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Yeah but I really believe that there was an audience there for what we were talking about

318
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
So you guys were recovering like what like

319
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
The center of the Earth

320
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
Couch alternative scene in Montreal like skaters and

321
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
Punctual

322
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Is music like Underground Music

323
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
And

324
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
Terrible editorial about

325
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,407
The search for authenticity and then heat for like quitting wheel contact but

326
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
I stand by that editorial like

327
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
I hope you got nobody ever finds out and publishes again because it

328
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
It was awful but it is the spirit

329
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Of what we do today is

330
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,511
Was was there you are so like you are basically the editor-in-chief of this

331
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
Magazine in early 20s voice Montreal

332
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,191
And like who did you hear some the people you brought in to help you started in

333
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Create it

334
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
You're one of my

335
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Friends from college he connected me to a bunch of different artists and also two different writers in one of these writers

336
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
It was a guy named Gavin McInnes and he

337
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
It was funny and had a comic book called pervert

338
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
That's why I asked him to become my assistant editor

339
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,439
And I think I ask him to be my, excited or whatever that means

340
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,583
It was his job to find the different comic artists around town and put together a Comics page

341
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
Who's out, the public face of a vice I guess

342
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
How did he how did he get involved

343
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
So Shane and Gavin

344
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Grew up together in Auto up

345
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
And

346
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
The first night we met he was just like he said literally said you're my new best friend

347
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
On acid as well I should know I should qualify this

348
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Should I use in a bar called a bifteck

349
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
Gavin I had been

350
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,207
Drive around the city all day Distributing the magazine it'll just come out

351
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
And we finished all rounds and went to the bar to meet Shane and he was in there he's been waiting for a couple hours for us and

352
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
By himself somehow managed

353
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Epicurus of psychedelics and was drunken

354
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Novice

355
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Of course you don't

356
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Sober

357
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
Tires and I walk him this a drunk man on psychedelics

358
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
Who is I call you from Pakistan you must love cricket and then was like

359
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
Pretending to like bowl like balls at me and

360
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,231
But he worked for Greenpeace before and he could actually sell

361
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
With greenpeace usa

362
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
Erase a lot of money for them and

363
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Eastern European

364
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Involved with some activities

365
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,775
Where he was making lots of money

366
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,871
Basin activities I'm going to leave it up. He was good at making money and you could

367
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Yo self

368
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Rattlesnake boots to Rattlesnake

369
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295

00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Me Gavin and Shane working

371
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
In this

372
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Office with the Haitians

373
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
We were there for like 3-4 months and

374
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
But it wasn't working out

375
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Because we weren't getting paid

376
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
Commissions on the ads that we were selling it

377
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
But we're on welfare

378
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
And so we talked about the vacations and said

379
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
You don't

380
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
It's time for us to believe in

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
We came up with this thing where

382
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
We said the Village Voice has a trademark on the word boys

383
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
And there are suing us and forcing us to change our name piss you guys were the voice of Montreal yes we told the world

384
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,951
That we were being sued by The Village Voice and that's why we had to change the name device

385
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,559
Basically made this thing up about the Village Voice did to generate publicity

386
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah

387
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
And it was a complete lie

388
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,775
I got out of that's why we dropped the O and then how we started Vice City basic Curry today

389
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,383
We we created a new message

390
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Why did you like to go

391
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,551
To find a new office or did you start working at your apartment or that's a good question we we got it a new Loft

392
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
And like not too far from the original office

393
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,463
I brought five grand for my parents Davenport five grand from his

394
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
Parents and Shane got $5,000 worth of computers

395
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
From his dad is that working

396
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
No ID or something and

397
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
So it was with that

398
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
10000

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Dollars

400
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Canadian

401
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
That we started Vice

402
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Okay so this is now like

403
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Like I guess the mid-90s

404
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
And you guys

405
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Vice

406
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
What was the magazine like at that point

407
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
What did you cover

408
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
We

409
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Really wanted to

410
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Again

411
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
It's such an over

412
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Use word guy but it's

413
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
It's a good one authenticity like how do you create

414
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Real Kanto

415
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
And we're going to journalism School

416
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
So the way to do that is to get as close to the source

417
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
It's possible

418
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
And if we were going to write an article about

419
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
The prostitution

420
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Community in Montreal let's

421
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Get the process

422
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Write that story

423
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,783
Then let's go out with pimps as they drive around and interview them and so we created this

424
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Really raw

425
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Magazine

426
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
There are a lot of typos but it was

427
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
Alive like I did the worst kind of jumped out

428
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
The pages and it was kind of shocking stuff and yeah

429
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
And we were so

430
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Without freedom of

431
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Depress

432
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,911
With such a big deal like we're so anti-censorship that even

433
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
If you

434
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
I'll be towards advertising if you

435
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
By that page of advertising you on that page you can do whatever you want with

436
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
So we have these

437
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
Skateboard companies from Southern California that had like

438
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Your p*** stars in their ads

439
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Nude pornstars in the ad so the magazine all the sudden has

440
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
He's crazy articles with

441
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
Lots of nudity advertising

442
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,487
Skateboard companies called serial killer skateboards or whatever it was

443
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
This whole weird little

444
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Take on

445
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,143
American culture that was coming from Montreal so we were

446
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,495
Science magazine to San Francisco Chicago La New York in

447
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Americans reading it up

448
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
So you guys making money like

449
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Pretty soon after

450
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Like bootstrapping it

451
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Barely

452
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
We were bootstrapping it be

453
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Cuz we couldn't

454
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Afford to have that we didn't

455
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
We couldn't get a loan

456
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
So we

457
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
Just printed copies based on how much we were

458
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Selling an advertising and

459
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
It's what we call this

460
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
It's kind of punk rock capitalism

461
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Be really aggressive be really ambitious and you can't have that

462
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Those are the rules that we live by until we

463
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Tok our investment

464
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
The first time

465
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
That was an

466
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
98

467
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
Give me some 25% of the company to running rich

468
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Jigsaw Winski

469
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
So he he was like

470
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
A rich guy who

471
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Invest

472
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
It seems like kind of a

473
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Crazy and that's

474
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
So Shannon I had realized at that point that we needed

475
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Some help if we want to grow the mag

476
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Magazine

477
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
Raku Investments like maybe Larry Flintwood and

478
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
There was a guy in Montreal

479
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Richard sowinski who

480
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,031
Had a software company called discrete logic that he'd sold to Autodesk for several hundred billion dollars and

481
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
He was

482
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Starting to buy a media properties

483
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
And we had been

484
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,479
Interviewed by the French daily and Montreal called The Press

485
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
And so we said

486
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
In that interview in the press that he was interested in buying us

487
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
And he done Reddit

488
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
And then it had his office contact us a few days later and said

489
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
He wants to meet you guys who are you guys

490
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,911
He has no idea who you are but apparently he's interested in buying a so we met him

491
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
An individual very quickly

492
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
To sell 25% of the company to him

493
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,871
Crazy amount of money for you guys at the time

494
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Raise

495
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Yeah

496
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
This could have happened in Montreal there was no due diligence that took place

497
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
It was literally one meeting with him

498
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
At a restaurant that he

499
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,207
He loved until he bought it and moved it into the basement of his office

500
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
And he

501
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Brought a bottle of Jack Daniels

502
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
And kind of for Shane to drink a bunch of it

503
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
And that the end of the meeting said I want

504
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,471
To buy piece of your magazine come back to me in a week and tell me how much

505
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
And and don't try and gouge me

506
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,871
And so we we left his office and spend a week going like how much

507
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
Do we value our company for like it

508
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
I was kind of arbitrary pulled it from the air

509
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,343
Yeah we pulled it from the air and came up with this number somehow justify that it was

510
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
What is a million bucks

511
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
And he read it

512
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
What is all in one piece paper to

513
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
The price of ice

514
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
He right at the Sun

515
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
That's a lot of money and then he signed it

516
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
And they wished us upstairs and they wrote us checks

517
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
And I think his

518
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
Advisors like this is such a bad idea

519
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,823
This shouldn't be happening but again no due diligence no like accounting nothing

520
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
And his office was actually walking distance

521
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
More office in

522
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
We went out it was

523
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
Springtime in Montreal we literally did somersaults in the grass

524
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
When we left 50000

525
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
So what's up with that money

526
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
You were able to

527
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Scale magazine

528
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839
We're able to move to New York

529
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
Wake up back the story of Isis move to New York and it's almost complete collapse

530
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
It's how I built this from NPR

531
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943

00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,911

$250,000 check

568
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
And a

569
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Dream to become much

570
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Speaker

571
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:13,760
We always had aspirations to talk about the world and other things as well and we

572
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,856
It started building up a stable of writers that was International

573
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
But we had a ceiling

574
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
Becoming National in Canada

575
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,792
Wasn't good enough for us we aspired for more and we thought okay we have to go.

576
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
If we want to become

577
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Bigger

578
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
We need to go to either New York or London or LA

579
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
And so what is your investor Richard zielinski

580
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Want you to say

581
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
To do with the money

582
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
He had this vision

583
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,152
So he had advice and then he had a magazine called shift

584
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
Which was like a spin meets wired kind of

585
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Magazine for slightly older crowd and then he had another company called Halo 46

586
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Which was

587
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
Kind of luxury goods high-end brand

588
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
And he wanted all three of these brands

589
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
To diversify and become multichannel brands

590
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,328
That was going to be tied into a big e-commerce platform

591
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
And he's going to take it all pop

592
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
And in so that's what we did with the money we

593
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,824
We built a fashion division the film division the TV division of Music division

594
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
And

595
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Beside with brick and mortar

596
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Presents for your

597
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,016
Fashion Division and education that you guys weren't even

598
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
Thinking about like you were you were thinking we're just two

599
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
Physique

600
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
He's kind of ahead of the Curve

601
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,232
This kind of like an Amazon kind of thing and

602
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Like we came in and we actually

603
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,608
Executed his business plan and like you actually started a fashion label

604
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
And we had we had four

605
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Tory clothing store like you got designers to make like Vice

606
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Fashion advertising

607
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Clothes

608
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
That we we realized by doing it that

609
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,808
We don't want to sell pants for a living that were better at making contest

610
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
That's really what we want to do but it served its purpose at the time

611
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Seems like really

612
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
Like trying to move no

613
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Very quickly

614
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
So when's he kind of

615
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Run out of money in retreated to Nantucket

616
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
And this is when the butler.com bubble

617
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Exactly

618
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
So what were they leave you guys

619
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
It left us

620
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,688
You know high and dry like stores in New York you an office space in Manhattan and

621
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
You had employees

622
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
And you are

623
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
I'd no money

624
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
90%

625
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
It was bad

626
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
It was bad time

627
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
So what happened to zielinski

628
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:35,072
We found out that Richard was in Nantucket at his house and so we rented a car and drove up there

629
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
We took the ferry over

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
And

631
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Calling from a payphone

632
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Can you pick this up

633
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
And was very surprised that we were there we had met any contact with him for in like a month or something like that was coming

634
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Russia running out of money

635
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Yeah

636
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,040
So we went to his house we're like what's going on you said it's over the money's gone

637
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
I'm done

638
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
I can't put any more money into this

639
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
So

640
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
What are we doing so

641
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,792
Then we came back and that's when we move to Brooklyn

642
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,632
We left his office I unscrewed the mirrors out of the bathroom and

643
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,216
Put the plants in the desks and filing cabinets that we still have

644
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm still using the same filing cabinet that I stole from that office on 27th Street

645
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
It all happened so quickly we

646
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
And we sold more equity

647
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Saul Alinsky so we ended up taking over

648
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
Control of the whole company at that point

649
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Okay so wait

650
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Before the company basically fell apart

651
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
He he bought the entire company from you

652
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
Yeah and then like we did a stock trade

653
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,328
Our shares for his company which was called normal net

654
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,960
And the like you're worth 44 million dollars now so we went for me on welfare to theoretically being

655
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Worth 40 million bucks

656
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
In a very short amount of time

657
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
2

658
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
It just all collapsing and being broke again

659
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,200
And all the sudden we have these stores and we have death

660
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
For the first time

661
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,368
And so when's he still owned completely owns the brand of that point and then we bought it back from him

662
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
How did you do that

663
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Verb

664
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
Pennies-on-the-dollar Shane data deal and

665
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
You know he was

666
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
Nice to us in a way like

667
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Even though

668
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
He put us out of business but he was

669
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,496
He he agreed to sell

670
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
The company back to us when we did a deal with him

671
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
I can't remember exactly how much but for

672
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
4 and we got a deal to buy the cup

673
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
I'll be back sweetie

674
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Dollar equity

675
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
How how are you able to raise the money to buy him out

676
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
I borrowed money from my brother

677
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
Well we'll have to borrow the money

678
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,512
So you guys buy the buy back to company

679
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Play it's yours again

680
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Essential you got to complete

681
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Rebuild it

682
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
So what did you do did you like I mean you got the

683
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Is the shop

684
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,288
She got the film Division and this division of the e-commerce like what are you do

685
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
We went back to

686
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
To doing things how

687
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
We had originally done them

688
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Which is

689
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
We can't have

690
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
And we owed all this money to these Italian like fashion companies who manufacture their clothes and Shane went and

691
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Took meetings with all of them

692
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
I figured out how to

693
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Reduce the debt

694
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
So he's like what I know you want 200000

695
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
I've got 20

696
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Take it or leave it

697
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Show me or take the 20 grand

698
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,448
And that's how we worked our way out of gas at that time and we just went back to

699
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Eating beans and rebuilding

700
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,592
And in doing things how we always done them before we

701
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
Tok investment

702
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
And so that was

703
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
You know

704
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Like

705
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,296
I really valuable lesson and being able to buy the company back

706
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
And

707
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Have a second chance

708
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
Was was huge

709
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,656
Cartoon in the midst of all this year you were still putting out the magazine

710
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Yeah the magazine was hot

711
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
They were still doing well like from a

712
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Cultural lag

713
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
Maybe not making a lot of money it was

714
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Profitable because

715
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
It had to be

716
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
We weren't paying people much money

717
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
And

718
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
We weren't Distributing millions millions of copies but it was getting out there and it was

719
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Who's making

720
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
An impact

721
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
I'm getting some recognition

722
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
And you're still mainly covering like

723
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Counterculture

724
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Yeah

725
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,864
But when occasionally we would have photojournalists that would come in who had been in Afghanistan

726
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Or

727
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,192
Jamaica and done something with like

728
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
You know

729
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,264
Gangsters in Jamaica and we would

730
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,360
Run their photos like we tried but we didn't have the resources

731
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
We didn't have

732
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
A net worth we weren't doing reporting

733
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
In the traditional sense at all

734
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,088
It was a Culture magazine that occasionally

735
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,648
Did some kind of music photojournalism

736
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
If it was

737
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Gritty and raw

738
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
But in 2006

739
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
That was when everything

740
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
Changed for us when we picked up cameras

741
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Yeah

742
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,472
We took a meeting with MTV

743
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
And they said if we gave you money to make a DVD what would you do

744
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
And we said it would be

745
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
Play jackass meet 60 minutes

746
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
And that work we were speaking their language

747
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
MN

748
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
So they gave us money to make a DVD

749
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
So he's okay let's go make the travel

750
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
The vice guide to travel DVD

751
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
I said where did you go

752
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
I went to Pakistan

753
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
We travel to Syria 3 years ago

754
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
What is the mass of illegal arms Market

755
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
Believed to be a source of weapons with Delavan

756
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
We just got to recreated what we done in the magazine

757
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
Is this loaded but it was the first time we

758
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:37,152
We were telling stories in a different medium and it was like a

759
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
8 Minute segment

760
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
We started on this DVD

761
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
That

762
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,064
Segment eventually ended up on the homepage of

763
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
CNN

764
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
And and

765
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
They treated as news

766
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
The co-founder of Vice

767
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,816
Took a trip to the country's most volatile City Karachi

768
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
It's crazy it to think about it right because

769
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
If you if you go back to the early 2000s

770
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Late 90s

771
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
There were a lot of really cool magazine

772
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
Show me there were a lot of really cool

773
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
Like seeing some people doing cool stuff and

774
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
But for some reason you guys

775
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
Made it at liquor why do you think

776
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,624
That is how was it that Vice

777
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Became vice

778
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
And those other magazine

779
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
We refused to die

780
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Again we're survivors

781
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
Right and we always

782
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
Find a way to do a deal even when

783
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
Times where it where dark and it was hard

784
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
And we found a way

785
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
And

786
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
We Diversified

787
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
The right time so we would have

788
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Some

789
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
Other deal

790
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
That would keep the lights on

791
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,576
While the magazine is going through a downturn and we're having a hard time selling ads

792
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
Don't do a big deal with with Viacom that will

793
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,232
Keep us going for another eight months you know and then

794
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
Do a deal with

795
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,584
No private Equity Firm and get some money from there

796
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,936
And it's okay but it is crazy that all those magazines are gone

797
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
For the most part and they were also

798
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Big

799
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
And we were like the stepchildren

800
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
And they disappeared

801
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,344
How do you feel when people say that basis is

802
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Like self-indulgent

803
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
You know I'm it's all about the reporter

804
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
And it's not really news

805
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,816
Because I mean you you have heard that right and you you hear that from mainstream news organizations

806
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Sure

807
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
So how do you feel about ending to you

808
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
Defensive guice ignore it or

809
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Maybe they're right

810
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,568
And we ignore it for the most part I think they're

811
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Often

812
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
Wrong or there they're basing it on

813
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
One thing that we did

814
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
Way back in the do whatever but I do believe

815
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Strongly and how we

816
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Creator content

817
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
And the importance of

818
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
Having a point of view

819
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
And and subjectivity

820
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
Yes we didn't go to journalism School

821
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
But I think that there is

822
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
A place for the type of content

823
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
That were making it

824
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
We're winning

825
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Peabody Award

826
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,032
You know for all the people that are taking shots of this also think

827
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Those

828
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
Accusations are coming from a place of

829
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
People feeling threatened as well

830
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
You know

831
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,040
Wild Al Jazeera America shutting down in that kind of thing

832
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Of course we've we have me Compton that isn't

833
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
Great that isn't perfect there are mistakes for learning we're going to school in public

834
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
You know in an in

835
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
And when I do think there's a lot that

836
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,704
They teach in journalism school that we've tried to incorporate into the content we make

837
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
2

838
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Be accountable

839
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,336
Yeah there ever been stories that you guys have done that you

840
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah

841
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
Can you talk about them without fear of being sued or

842
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,208
No I meant like that there's there's the one that the McAfee

843
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Story I don't know if you remember that one

844
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
The guy who did the

845
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,240
Exactly where we kind of embedded with him and and

846
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,848
Released a photo where we didn't scrub the

847
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
Geotag from it so people

848
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
We basically exposed exactly where

849
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
She was when he was on the run which we

850
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,832
Obviously we're trying to do and everybody

851
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
We celebrated that mistake

852
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
Everybody being

853
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
All the competition in in the other

854
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Unions are organizations that

855
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
Novi so they're trying to

856
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,680
Do this reporting in and they're making rookie mistakes so that was you know

857
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
Learning a lesson in in public the hard way

858
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
But for the most part

859
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
You know why I don't have a lot of

860
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Regrets about

861
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
But the content that

862
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,736
We make and have made visits got us to this point today

863
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Get me over time you guys have

864
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Attracts a lot of investment

865
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
And today

866
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Spices value it over for

867
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Billion

868
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Dollars

869
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
You started this like

870
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:15,680
English language version of a Haitian Fresh Magazine in 1994

871
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Like how crazy is

872
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,568
I mean it takes me back to that time on the street where my buddy said to me he said

873
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,688
Maybe I'll make one copy of the magazine or maybe it'll be huge one day and in my gut

874
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
At that time

875
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
I felt like oh maybe this could be huge I couldn't Define it I didn't know that this is how it was going to manifest itself

876
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
We would employ

877
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,208
New 2000 people in

878
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
And be valued at over four billion dollars but yeah it's it's pretty amazing

879
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,240
Suroosh alvi co founder of Vice

880
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,896
By the way since this episode first Ram last year vices valuation has gone up to over 5

881
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Billion dollars

882
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,040
That's for suroosh he's no longer editing BIOS on a daily basis these days

883
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,392
He spends most of his time traveling around the world and picking the stories

884
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,792
He wants to tell

885
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,912
Are you the only one of us without sleeve tattoos tattoos

886
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312

Instagram because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about

888
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
But the things you're building

889
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728

Podcast

896
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
Hey thanks for sticking around because

897
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
It's time now for how you build that

898
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,584
Ariel chicken with someone who he first interviewed back in the fall he's from Bend Oregon

899
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,984
I'm Sheridan owner of Wawa

900
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,384
Just coffee can says even though that coffee is instant and it comes in a little packet

901
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,784
So being able to just Add Water wherever you are is pretty special in my opinion without comp

902
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,624
Supervising the quality for even the highest coffee snob

903
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
Kisses that he's actually going for a flavor that tastes as good as a $4 pullover

904
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
Coffees that have a caramel sweetness nutty like hazelnut fake leather wet

905
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Hyacinth

906
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,544
Pine needles blueberry mango tropical fruit notes

907
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,920
Watermelon is getting these coffee beans from specialty Roasters all across the u.s. and he wants

908
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Starbucks Coffee online

909
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,040
But he's obviously not the first person to try to make a really good

910
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
High-end instant coffee

911
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Starbucks

912
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
So there is competition out there

913
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,512
One other problem as soon as we try to ramp up

914
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,584
Everything went crazy it seems like you know when you

915
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
Pump It Up in size and you have all of these

916
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Variables with

917
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,984
Temperature and pressure

918
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,032
It's not so clear-cut

919
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,384
Last November he had just finished a Kickstarter campaign

920
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
And he owed his backers

921
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
1339 cups of coffee

922
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
I mean I remember talking to you

923
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,160
Back in November and just being like I hope I hope this next batch is it

924
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
I was pretty determined

925
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
Find a way how to make it work

926
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
And give those people their coffee

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
And at the time Kent was

928
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
Kind of freaking out because the company in Missouri

929
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
It was helping him freeze-dry the coffee

930
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
Just kept sending in batches that taste

931
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
Burnt and metallic

932
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
And

933
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,968
That bass that we were waiting on it turn out completely ruined again

934
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
And we just decided

935
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
It's not going to work

936
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
Attend tennis partner would not

937
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Give up

938
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
So instead

939
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
We just double down

940
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,488
And instead of sending or coffee out

941
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,072
Two contractors to try to process it for us

942
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,144
We just purchased our own freeze-drying equipment

943
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
And went back to doing it just ourselves

944
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
And

945
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
It just got so much better

946
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Anime

947
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
Finally sent their first batch

948
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Their Kickstarter followers

949
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:45,504
That was such a relief I mean we were just waiting for it to be exactly what we promised and nothing less

950
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
That's Ken Sheridan of Wawa coffee

951
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,648
Which plans to launch for real in October by the way

952
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
They just caught another really big break

953
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,280
A major investment of $200,000

954
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,352
From a former VP at Stumptown Coffee

955
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,680
It's of course been so many ups and downs

956
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
But through every down there's

957
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
Just this even greater upside

958
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
So that's that's kind of what I love about this

959
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
