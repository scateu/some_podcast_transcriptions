11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
I tell you that's really exciting news is that we're doing

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
Two more Live Events

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,904
Supported by American Express open

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Before the end of this year

15
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,048
The first one will be right here in Washington DC on November 30th

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,656
My guess will be Robert Johnson who founded bet Black Entertainment Television

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,984
The second one is in Atlanta on December 6th

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,872
And I guess then we'll be Arthur Blank who co-founded Home Depot and who now owns the Atlanta Falcons

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,968
Tickets for both shows are going on sale soon so

I got more

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Okay

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
I was so freaked out the first day

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
I literally couldn't speak I just stood there people would ask me questions like how much

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
What's the style number and I like Frozen

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Help me out saying no

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Headlight

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Robin PR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Idealist

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Stories

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
And the movements

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,616
Introverted interior designer got over her Eileen Fisher

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
A multi-million-dollar clothing company

34
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
For women

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
So if you know a little bit about that clothing in this

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
The Giants

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Specially for women's apparel

38
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
I Brands like Chanel and

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Versace and Prada and

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
Of course H&M and Zara

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,424
So given that Eileen Fisher does about 300 million dollars a year in Revenue

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
It's comparatively small

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
But in women's fashion

44
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
The brand is also incredibly influential

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
And not just for the designs but how Eileen Fisher started her company

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
To be precise

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
With just

48
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
$350

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
She never took a dime from outside investor

50
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
And she still owns about 60% of her company

51
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Her employees

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
On the rats

53
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,840
Now you seen the clothes you'll know that they're pretty spare and minimalist

54
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Loki butt

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Also elegant

56
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Which is

57
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Describe Eileen Fisher

58
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Funny because lately I've been kind of calling my selfish IX

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,480
I think I don't know that I'm wired so much that way I just think that's something

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
I was kind of shut down when I was young

61
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
I know

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Classroom I remember they were like

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
60

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Kids in my Catholic

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
School classroom and

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Images always say for 2

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
To hide and to be small and

68
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Not speak

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,936
Ellen grew up in a middle-class family in Des Plaines Illinois in the 1950s

70
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
60th Street

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
Five Sisters

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
And a brother

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Her dad worked

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
Accountant for a local company in her mom's

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
Spent her days at home doing laundry

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
Cleaning and making dinner for all nine of them

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,808
I think but I mostly remember is my mother

78
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
You know they're kind of unhappiness I think I was hard

79
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
Beijing seven children then

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
I think she felt it was her job to do all the hard work

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
My dad felt

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
You know his jobs to go to work and make the money in

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
Come home and be taken care of after that so

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
She would

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Pretty much

86
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
We we start ranting and raving all day

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
And then my dad would come home and just before my dad would come home she would

88
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Get dressed

89
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Academy already in

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Sometimes you can put on lipstick

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
And

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
I just remember

93
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
I was about to say

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
Extend my mother had breakdown

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
And my father said that the

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Next day

97
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
He was driving to work

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Andy pettitte

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Pull over on the side of the road and he broke down crying realizing that

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
He had thought only a few days before that these are the happiest

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
But they were happy

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Let me know there were a lot of Happy

103
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Moments

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah we played the kids play you know we had the neighborhood

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Suburbs and bikes

106
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Reply

00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
Canik 9mm a good humor truck came down the stairs

108
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
We got ice cream things like that

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
So you know pretty much your tip

110
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Suburban experience

111
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Aileen wuornos

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
College at sea

113
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
University of Illinois in the late 1960s

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Any real idea what

115
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
She wanted to do

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Started out as a

117
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
The math major

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
But eventually

119
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
She decided on

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Interior design

121
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
You know it

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Just love fabric

123
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Coloring

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Playing with the shapes and

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
That's my mom for second I had sold with my mother when I was younger

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
So that was some of my

127
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Happy memories with my mother

128
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
I used to have you

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Picture in my mind

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Clothes I want to wear

131
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
We would go shopping

132
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
I love being the Fabrics

133
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
My favorite place

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
In her early twenties Eileen moved to New York with a friend

135
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
But with no real plan

136
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Skip this one 1972 when you

137
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,943
You could actually find an apartment in Manhattan for a hundred bucks a month

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
Search parent Eileen started doing some freelance graphic

139
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Design gigs

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Eventually

141
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,439
She got a job working with a Japanese graphic designer named sushi moora

142
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
I was an assistant so I started this

143
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Doing whatever needed to be

144
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
And

145
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
We design logos

146
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
And we designed packages

147
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Thanks for banks and

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Then we did stuff for Japanese clients

149
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Can be urine

150
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Things like that

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
And

152
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
After a short while we were like working together and

153
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,479
You know we ended up getting into a relationship

154
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
She was like

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Oh no

156
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
And were you

157
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Traveling to Japan

158
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Bright

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
Right so this is exactly where the clothing idea came from

160
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
Ice that we started traveling

161
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
We took two trips

162
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Together two

163
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Japan

164
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
I'm just trying to imagine like this is the

165
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
I guess the

166
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Mid-to-late

167
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
70s

168
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
7 year flying from New York to

169
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,663
Japanimation pretty glamorous right and that was a big deal

170
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah I guess

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
So

172
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
It was also kind of stressful you know I felt

173
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Pressure and

174
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,623
You know I couldn't speak the language so

175
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Tried hard to learn it

176
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
There was glamour yes I guess

177
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
You know

178
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
But I'm not I don't I'm not so attractive

179
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
Glamour I am always more uncomfortable with glamour Sam this uncomfortable person that's why I had to make you comfort

180
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Football gloves

181
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
What what struck you about

182
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
About design

183
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
So you came across in Japan

184
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223

They were just

193
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
Do you know use different Fabrics in different techniques

194
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
To make it

195
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Different every time and

196
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
And it was beautiful

197
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Beautiful and

198
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
That inspired me

199
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
How long did you did you work with is it was real

200
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
How long did you work

201
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
About

202
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
4 years

203
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
And

204
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
I mean that

205
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
Of course anytime there's a

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
Professional and personal relationship that this can also always often causes some complications

207
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
What was that

208
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,143
Does that sort of begin to unravel your personal relationship begin to unravel your professional relationship

209
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
God

210
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,543
Yes definitely it was all connected

211
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
We thought we could split up and work continue to work together but that became

212
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
Clear Within

213
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
You want that was just not going to work

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
But yeah so I ended up

215
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
Separating getting my own little Loft eventually after about a year of bouncing around and

216
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
Hiding a little space in a Lofton

217
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Rebecca and you lived and worked

218
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Where I lived and worked

219
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
And I was stumbling around doing

220
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Still in office

221
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
I know some Japanese clients still and then some

222
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Other

223
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Work I was

224
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
Stumbling around and getting I don't even know how I feel

225
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
The pack

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
Cuz it was really

227
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Day by day and it was it was

228
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Freelance like

229
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Design work

230
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
Apartments I did a few apartments

231
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Small office

232
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
Dentist office tinkler whatever I

233
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
And trying to survive

234
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Pay the rent and you know

235
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
Keep working as a designer and not go back to

236
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
Working as a waitress at my one commitment I was going to end up

237
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Waitressing again I hadn't done that in many years and I can let go back to

238
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
And then I met him

239
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
People and that's when

240
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
I thought I had been kind of cooking on the side

241
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Idea

242
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Of the

243
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
And the clothing business and cooking on this idea

244
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Already in the early 80s

245
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
Oh yeah

246
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
It was it was in my mind for probably five years before the first garments appeared to make your own clothes or two

247
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Find clothes that was in your mind right to try and design idea come from

248
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,055
I don't know I think some of it was at when I was trying to get dressed

249
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,663
Let me know if the Japanese clients and you know the different I want it I need it

250
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,247
Look like a designer and what did that mean

251
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
What does it mean to look like a designer put together and no no

252
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,047
Clean and elegant and simple I wanted to reflect my own style of my own aesthetic

253
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
And I wore uniform when I was young

254
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
When I

255
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Trying to get dressed as a designer

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
I kind of I never really liked the uniform but I

257
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Like the concert

258
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Just making

259
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Getting dressed

260
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Shut up and

261
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,271
Have enough to think about you enough to worry about

262
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Get put the clothes on go now

263
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
I wanted to make a

264
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
Simple but I didn't want it to be so confined that it had to be exactly

265
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Like you know the uniform

266
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Or in a one only one

267
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Particular

268
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,655
Chapin NY the same thing everyday and I just had this idea that I

269
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Could make these simple clothes no one's really doing it

270
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
And

271
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,567
The images would come to me I would see this simple shapes

272
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
And the first one I remember was I called a box

273
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
Quite straight lines like a kimono sleeve and

274
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
It was about the whale

275
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Drape when you had it on

276
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
But I was kind of the first pick

277
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Picture that came to me and others were

278
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
You know the simple

279
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Will Wiley pants and you know there was a vast and shovel and the first few pieces of the started come to me

280
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
I was talking to people cuz now I had artists

281
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Friends in Tribeca and

282
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,103
Other people who were designing clothes and jewelry and things like that

283
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Which often happens when people have an idea

284
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
You were saying how this idea

285
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Design

286
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Beautiful simple

287
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,671
Piece of clothing for women and and we're your friends think you should go for you

288
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Definitely

289
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Definitely and you would have these conversations for

290
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
You know

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
For a long time with many people like over a period of 5 years

292
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
People probably really obsessed

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
This is what I'm curious about

294
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Because

295
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
This is the point at which

296
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
99.9

297
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Percent of people

298
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Do nothing

299
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Did they have a great idea

300
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
And

301
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,807
They do nothing either because they decide not to do something or

302
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Just because of

303
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Bad luck

304
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
What was it

305
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
That

306
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
Switch that idea into something you actually tried

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Okay that's good

308
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
So

309
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
I think

310
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
What happened is that I'm so I'm seeing

311
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
Pictures and I'm trying to imagine Where do I

312
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
And how would I make this

313
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Happened

314
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,359
And I couldn't picture myself you know

315
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,991
Like what if I made these clothes how would I do that and went and then I couldn't picture myself how would I sell them

316
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,087
You know what I go to stores other people are telling me they were going to like

317
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
Henri Bendel in waiting in line for hours and bio go like nope

318
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
I don't like it

319
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
That was not you you were not a

320
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
You're not a hustler now

321
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
No I was a shy

322
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Introvert at a time

323
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
But I knew I couldn't I was definitely on Hustler and I could not

324
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,871
The idea was mortifying to you to have

325
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,967
What what what do you think it was the would have been the hardest

326
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Part of that

327
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
Rejection semi saying no or trying to articulate

328
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
What would it was it you

329
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Both

330
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Both

331
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
I think

332
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Probably it was still rejected

333
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
The time in oh

334
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
But art

335
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Calculating

336
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Was and still is

337
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
What kind of

338
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Initial for me

339
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Just thinking today about trying to tell story

340
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,055
Great encouragement

341
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
So you're thinking

342
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Alright I

343
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
I don't want

344
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Try this but I

345
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,759
I cannot even imagine what I would do after

346
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
I would have liked a sample of this

347
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
Until what ended up happening is that a friend who took me to the boutique show

348
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,791
And is like a famous show in like a trade show

349
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
It's at Rachel

350
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Inn in York

351
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Right

352
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,471
But it was a show Big Show that cater to the small boutiques around the country

353
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,079
And a lot of small designers and small companies would come there and show their thing

354
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,151
And so I remember going to the show

355
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Out of curiosity Crainer

356
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
And, floating through and going like oh

357
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
I can do this

358
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
I see how to do this

359
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,767
I could just look at these different foods and saw how the designers were presenting their clothes

360
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
A little rack here a few things hanging

361
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,215
You know I know how to do a logo I could do they had I need a logo wouldn't I need a name you know

362
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
So I could picture

363
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
The whole story so it wasn't just like one garment

364
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
It was that I had to

365
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
People have to see a kind of ahold understand that it went together

366
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,319
And that it was a a little story somehow by going to the design

367
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
Show you thought well I don't have to be Carnival Barker I can just stand here and wait for people to come to me back when the people who

368
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Like it

369
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Will come in

370
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Write orders or you know

371
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
Give me feedback and the people who don't like it'll just walked by

372
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Committed to

373
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Small section just like one

374
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
For 4

375
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
The same designer next show

376
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
For the next show

377
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
This is in like 1980

378
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
3

379
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
3 because I think for that I

380
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Show that I first introduced

381
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,463
You said I'm going to go there and show my go to dinner and then I'm going to

382
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
Show my clothes right I have no clue

383
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
I know fabric you had designs

384
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
How much time do you have

385
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
3 weeks

386
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
You are the lyrics to come up with a

387
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Clothing line of fashion line

388
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
No don't care do I know it wasn't really a special line to start out with for garments

389
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
But I had

390
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
So now you know as a kid so I knew

391
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
You know that it wasn't that comp

392
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
But I was lucky in that this is how is this is

393
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Kind of weird how things

394
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Happened but

395
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,191
You know again one of the friends I've been talking to said I have a friend

396
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
With a pattern maker she works in a

397
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Clothing company

398
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Maybe she can help you

399
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
So she came into work for me at night and on the weekends

400
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
The first three weeks this this woman

401
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Volunteered

402
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,295
And she wouldn't will she said you can pay me I know you're getting a good for you can pay me

403
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
When you get paid

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,391
Did you drop a bunch of designs and give them to her

405
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Tissot

406
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
Or did you sell them well

407
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,583
I pretty much talked my way through it I scribbled them you know my little sketches and she said well those are

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
They're pretty simple

409
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,983
What's special about the Miley and I was like well it's special that they're simple

410
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
But I'll help you

411
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
And so first I had to find fabric

412
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
I was kind of the

413
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
She helped me

414
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
No figure out where I could go to get Fab

415
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
What what kind of fabric was

416
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
It was a linen and cotton blend

417
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Yeah so what did you what did you end up making

418
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
I made the Box

419
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Top

420
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
The little crop

421
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Pant

422
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
Kind of based on the flood pants from Japan

423
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
And I made a little

424
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
Shell invest the kind of went over

425
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
The

426
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,287
Top and then I made a little shelter

427
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,407
We're at the Shell with a simple pant oh my God you feel like the pieces on my line today it's so amazing

428
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
To see the pictures and the color colors were they

429
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
They were like a teal color and kind of

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Burgundy

431
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
Black white burgundy salmon eat pinky right now

432
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Ana ivory

433
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
So after 3 weeks you had

434
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
4

435
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Piece of clothing

436
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Samples

437
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
And that's what you were going to take

438
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
To this trade show

439
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
I will email them into three colors

440
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
So I had 12

441
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
And that's what I took

442
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
With my little logo

443
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,591
And I was I spent probably as much time obsessing about the

444
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
The graphics and the name because I didn't want to call it a new fish

445
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Because I didn't see it as soap

446
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Personal

447
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
I thought it was something that

448
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
You know

449
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
People would make their own

450
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
That it would

451
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
I hope that it wasn't so personally me it was

452
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Change

453
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
What's up what did you end up calling it for the

454
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Cuz I couldn't think of anything else and I was working as Eileen Fisher the designer

455
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,639
I already had my name registered as a business so I guess if I was going to take checks

456
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Better having business name and so that's

457
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Work for them

458
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
So like when they

459
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
When they make the Eileen Fisher Story movie

460
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
Like feature film one day and they have this scene in there

461
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
First trade show

462
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Is this like this

463
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
Amazing moment where designers are like

464
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
Oh my gosh this is Life Church and I have never seen anything like it is that what was going on no no no no no

465
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Absolutely not

466
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
I was so

467
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Freaked out

468
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
First

469
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
I literally couldn't

470
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
I just

471
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
People would ask me questions like

472
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
How much does it cost

473
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
What's the style number

474
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
And I like

475
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Brought with them

476
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Other people in my booth would help me out saying no

477
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047
I just want to give you a hug and say it's going to be

478
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Bok

479
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
This is like

480
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
I was like

481
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Headlights

482
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
She said did you eventually get over the stage fright in and

483
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Start selling

484
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
I did I did I felt so to 8 stores

485
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
I felt about a hundred piece

486
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
So couple thousand bucks

487
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Yep 3000

488
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Boxer

489
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Skipping home saying

490
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
I was thrilled

491
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,231
And it was the right amount because anymore I would have never been able to deliver

492
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
I wouldn't be able to get enough fabric I would have been able to figure it all out

493
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Fast enough or get the money to make it happen

494
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
Yeah so that was a pretty that was pretty good you walk away $3,000 and these are boutiques around the country

495
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Right

496
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
And presumably

497
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Fill those orders

498
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
You made most of them

499
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Yourself

500
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,295
Cut everyone myself on the floor in my loft in Tribeca

501
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
And then carry them in garbage bag

502
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Down my stairs

503
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Subway in

504
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
The queens and did you show your name Eileen Fisher in the

505
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Act like a nut

506
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,167
Close the label I had an label Maids at the source

507
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Tiny sewing company

508
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Out in Queens

509
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Sodam

510
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
So at this point this is like 1984

511
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
You got three thousand bucks

512
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
End

513
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Are you like

514
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
Incorporated youku like do an LLC and all that

515
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Stuff

516
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
I don't think I did that until

517
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
I got my next round

518
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
So how did that

519
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
Well I came up with 8

520
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Style

521
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
And went back to the next one

522
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
And this time I had this

523
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
New fabric that I found it was a

524
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Barry Tech

525
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Extra French terry bearing

526
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,823
Lush fabric

527
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
Yeah

528
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
More like a

529
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
Elegant sweatshirt fabric

530
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503

531
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Came back with

532
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295

And

537
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
This time

538
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
People stood in line

539
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,328
I was like oh my God I knew

540
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Something was happy

541
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

574
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Gyros

575
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
So at this point in the story

576
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Eileen had just sold

577
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
$40,000 worth of orders in her second trade show

578
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
And things seem to be looking up

579
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Only problem was

580
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
Now to figure out how to

581
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Put together a real functioning business

582
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,896
But I was even for the back figuring out just how do I get the money

583
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Buy the fabric

584
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
And

585
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
You know

586
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,296
You know how am I going to produce this you had

587
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
You have $40,000

588
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
What's $40,000 in cash budget

589
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Maybe orders

590
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,512
You had to go and buy all of the material

591
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
And I'm assuming you

592
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
You didn't have $40,000

593
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
Right well I would have needed about 20 to do the production

594
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
And but I got some good advice sexy while I was at the

595
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
DHL that I deliver

596
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
Small order first

597
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Why did White

598
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
Just for a lycan February delivery and then I did

599
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,296
The other colors for delivery couple months later so that let me spread out the delivery in

600
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
I could

601
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
Produce part of it while I was trying to turn the money

602
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
I did the orders on COD so then

603
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
When they delivered the

604
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
Boutiques with write a check and they had to pay right away to pay right away and

605
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,680
You know I have to show when they were standing line it was kind of easy to ask him to do Cod because I have

606
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
How to play with them I'm a small designer need

607
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
PCR DNA

608
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,128
Accommodated me but did you also try to get a loan at a bank

609
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664

610
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,320
You know I went to the bank I remember and I with my stack of orders and they were like well how long he been in business

611

It was so delighted to finally

684
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
I remember that's when he was

685
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
Fire somebody from Bloomingdales came in because they've been looking at the line I'm curious

686
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
And they would say things like

687
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,456
You know it is a great close but you know they're just going to get lost at Bloomingdale's

688
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
And

689
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Simple

690
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Simple you know

691
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
But I knew that was the idea

692
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Anyway so when they came into the

693
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
So are they new

694
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
They didn't understand it but they knew something was happening

695
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,144
And so they wanted to open the shop

696
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Smoke shop

697
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984

00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Catapult address to another phase

699
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104

And it seemed like they were people who

705
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
You know

706
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Say they

707
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
They help people find themselves

708
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Something like that you know

709
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
That are that they could

710
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Figure out how to

711
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
Make your own style with these

712
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Is closed and they could

713
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
They operate in the you know not inside

714
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
The corporate world they didn't have to dress

715
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Certain kind of way

716
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Were you able to finance

717
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
The stores

718
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
And

719
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
The production just threw

720
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Existing sales

721
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,880

What fabric in bulk even though we were small

723
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Because we

00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
I was very dedicated to a certain fabric so

725
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Built around 1 fabric

726
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400

It was growing and it was

734
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Unprofitable

735
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
It was always profitable

736
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
From there were you

737
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488

Just

00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Off the charts with you

740
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Who's that was happening

741
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
You know it was

00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Strong and steady and I know it was

743
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Not exactly awesome

744
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Charts

745
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,360

748
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Mosto

749
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Wasn't

750
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
2 out of

751
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Controls

752
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,488
You know it was mostly organic it was never like an attempt to make it ever bigger than it was

753
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
It was more like okay

754
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
It's working so that's open to more stores

755
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
Or it's working for more store

756
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
You know or now you know

757
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
No other department stores want to buy the line

758
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Shaq

759
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Nordstrom's

760
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
You know

761
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
That kind of thing

762
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
What was your Revenue with that

763
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Oh

764
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Different moments in time how much

765
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,184
I can't remember I remember my dad came to visit me one time in the early days and he

766
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,280
Set back in the chair he was in the county was going over some of my books I want to make sure I was

767
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
Campaign things are working out okay without

768
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Adorable

769
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
And he sat back in the chair

770
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Do you know

771
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
How much money you made

772
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Here

773
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,824
And I said no I really don't think he said

774
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
200

775
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Gross sales

776
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Forcing her plenty of expensive but

777
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
You know was still

778
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Pretty

779
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Pretty shocking

780
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,184
How did you I mean as the company was growing

781
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
1990s

782
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
How did you

783
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Deal with

784
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Being a CEO did you

785
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
Did you like that

786
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
No no no no no

787
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
No I think it's CEO is

788
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
A word that I've always

789
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
I am always been sort of uncomfortable

790
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,712
Not actually held that title used to call myself Chief creative officer that was sort of the clothes

791
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,808
I could come but I did know that sort of the bucks stop with me

792
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
You know sometimes I had to make important decisions

793
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Now which work would have been would be hard

794
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
But I always kind of help

795
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
Business leadership standpoint pretty

796
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Pretty loosely

797
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
And so I like the designers

798
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Being with it and making it snow

799
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
Their own and working together and you know

800
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
In the in a sort of collective way

801
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,128
And I feel that way about the leadership and even today were leadership

802
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Team

803
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,296
Pretty complicated and we're really working to streamline it and we're getting better we're getting a lot better

804
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Period of time when you really mean

805
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Really just started

806
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Exploding

807
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Yeah

808
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Did you find yourself in a position

809
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,584
That you were reluctant to be in

810
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Yeah

811
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,008
I saw myself more as a designer artist

812
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Rather than a business person

813
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Even though I wasn't bad at it

814
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
In terms of

815
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
Maybe not so much the managing people

816
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
I guess I never like telling people what to do

817
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
I ate and I never liked working

818
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
For other people

819
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
Oh you know when they would try to tell you what to do it didn't

820
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,280
I didn't like being told I like give me the problem and let me do it my way

821
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Nothing

822
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Ellen DeGeneres

823
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
I mean I know that

824
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
In the 90s it was a

825
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
Incredibly

826
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,312
Active time for Eileen Fisher and

827
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
Continue and also personally knew you were

828
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
You been married

829
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
You had to

830
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Children died in the

831
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
4 year period of time

832
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,088
Two young kids you are trying to run this company

833
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
And

834
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Your marriage was

835
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
I'm falling apart

836
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
2

837
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
How did you

838
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
You manage the personal on the

839
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
I would say that wasn't the hardest

840
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Hardest

841
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Ever and if I look back

842
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
Man if I could do anything differently that be

843
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
I'm not not going into regret but

844
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,592
That was incredibly hard

845
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,224
God I think about all the women out there trying to start businesses and work in the business world and

846
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
So hard to do

847
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
Men's families

848
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,136
So I really had to rely on

849
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
People in company

850
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
I tried

851
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
Two again Minnesota lead Loosely into

852
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
But I

853
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,728
With being in two different places and wanting to be at work when I was at home or worrying about work

854
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
You know I'm reading reports and trying to understand is

855
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,360
It's working or not what's working and what's going wrong

856
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
And at the same time worrying about

857
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
The kids when I was at work and just

858
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
You know

859
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
I guess the

860
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,856
Nothing I say to myself now is that if I look back I would

861
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,672
I would have just worked harder and being where I was

862
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Doing what I was

863
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Doing in the moment

864
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Stop tryna

865
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
B2 play

866
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
And stop taking the work home and do the best

867
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Toucannon

868
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,448
You weren't trying to be the best mom you could be and

869
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
And also run the company

870
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
And

871
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
And you

872
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
I messed up

873
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
It's kind of sounds a bit like

874
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
What your mom went through

875
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
Overwhelmed right I mean she was

876
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
It was relentless everyday was his hamster wheel

877
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah

878
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,976
I did the best I could I I had to let go a lot of hair

879
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
How to trust a lot of pee

880
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
People

881
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,888
Which wich worked and didn't you know it worked in places

882
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
And then there were moments that I felt

883
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
You know sad about her let go too much over here on

884
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
I know

885
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,432
Going to a store and see pieces I didn't recognize or feel like the line didn't look where I adore

886
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:03,808
I couldn't find the clothes I wanted to wear or wasn't really the concept it was gone

887
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
Where was the soul of this company and you know what happened

888
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Yeah

889
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
You know

890
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
Once I got divorced

891
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
My kids were four and eight

892
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
And I said I am

893
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
I'm going to stop working on Wednesday Thursday Friday

894
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
3

895
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,728
I worked in my home a lot and I would

896
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,360
I'll let the people keep working and I close the door and go out and be with my kids

897
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,712
And you know my husband will have the kids on Mondays and Tuesdays and

898
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
Share the weekends things like that

899
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,320
So it actually

900
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
Works better for me I don't think it worked

901
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
So well for them they didn't really like the going back and forth

902
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
Dolphin and I guess

903
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Yeah

904
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
But I think that

905
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,632
I know overtime I sorted it out and

906
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
Things got better I got I got stronger I I started doing things like yoga and meditating I had some time to myself

907
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
My mother never had you know

908
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
I don't have to have a breakdown actually so

909
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
To get a hold of myself

910
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,784
SharePoint Eileen where you thought cuz your business was

911
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
I just bought are huge like you were

912
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Successful

913
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,488
Beyond Your Wildest Dreams the late 90s is not even

914
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Today and

915
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
Did you ever think maybe I should just

916
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
Passionate and sell his company to somebody in just

917
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Wash my hands

918
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
Oh my God no I never never thought they had never filed

919
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
Never never cross your mind

920
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,736
That would be like selling my first born child really felt like that under so much stress and you had

921
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
You did have that security blanket

922
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
You could have done that

923
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,368
Alright was never about the money no

924
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
I mean

925
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Probably in the very beginning when I didn't know how to price

926
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Close wasn't about the money by

927
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,584
It was personal I guess I wanted it to be how I wanted it

928
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
To be and I think

929
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Still true

930
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,984
And actually what I did do was sell part of the business of employees

931
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
So we are 40% and Esau

932
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Employee-owned

933
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
And I always wanted that

934
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Collective idea wanted

935
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,712
I wanted the people who are apart of it

936
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,040
Paid and feel like owners and be owners

937
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Yeah

938
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
I think Eileen Fisher has

939
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Like

940
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
55 + apartment you buy lean fish

941
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Your company

942
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Has like

943
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
About 60 stores around the world

944
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Train rides

945
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
The right

946
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Ashley s and

947
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Thousands

948
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Employees

949
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
1200 direct employ

950
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
But many

951
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
Probably ten thousand people work daily on are making our clothes

952
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Presumably ask

953
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Became bigger and bigger it became

954
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
More corporate

955
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
More corporate because

956
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
I just had more people you have

957
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
He was like a lot of Revenue or doing a

958
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Plus million dollars a year

959
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Lizard point

960
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Mike Moore today but

961
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304

It is weird

967
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
Yeah it was weird

968
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
Still weird

969
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
Write a book called how I became Eileen Fisher

970
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Schleich

971
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
It's just strange

972
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Keep singing

973
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
If any of your dad

974
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Coming to visit you

In New York

976
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
In the early days insane

977
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,840
Like looking through your books and saying

978
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,448
You guys made $200,000 last year just being so

979
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
Blown Away by that

980
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Eileen Fisher.

981
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue

982
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
A year

983
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
I mean

984
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Is it strange

985
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
To you that you

986
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,416
Rich even though you never wanted to or tribe that wasn't your intention

987
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Yeah

988
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Oh yeah

989
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
I feel very uncomfortable

990
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
That's something that I am

991
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
I think my working therapy

992
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,424
Because you grew up with like

993
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
7 children your house of

994
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Dis Metairie

995
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,360
Middle-class oh yeah I put myself through college

996
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,920
I don't need to go to school so you know

997
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Temperature parents ever see

998
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
This level of 6

999
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Yeah my mother did

1000
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
My father was utterly totally impressed by

1001
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,440
I $20,000

1002
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
But my mother did I don't know that she understand

1003
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
Did it quiet

1004
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,912
You know my sister's will work in the store out in the Midwest and so she's going there

1005
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,264
She's so adorable she would go in and even as the company got really big and cheese

1006
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,104
Damages we have a section of Damages I did sell in the back

1007
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
Duarte

1008
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
And she'd go to the back

1009
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Storm picked out those dams

1010
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,528
Maven take him home

1011
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296

Go to the first

1013
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Put on the main rack

1014
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,184
But I think to her no

1015
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,536
You know it could have been 200,000 would be this big nobody

1016
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
Hitman

1017
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
How much to her

1018
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
It sounds like

1019
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
You are

1020
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,984
And in pretty good place in life

1021
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
How you personally

1022
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Assertive

1023
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
You don't have to do the

1024
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,456
Logistical operational stuff of the company

1025
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Can I have like vision and

1026
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
Big picture stuff and

1027
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
You seem like

1028
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904

Yeah well you know

1030
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Not everyday not all the time

1031
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,840
But I I know how to work with him

1032
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Can I watch my mother she was

1033
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Depressed

1034
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
And you know

1035
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
I remember having this inside

1036
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
And before I started the business

1037
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
When I went through a kind of a dark moment in my late twenties

1038
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,920
I remember going you know having this Revelation that

1039
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
I can make a different choice

1040
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
I don't have to be depressed

1041
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Because my mother was the

1042
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,648
Might have to be overwhelmed because my mother was overwhelmed but it don't have to be depressed

1043
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
I didn't I didn't understand the full impact

1044
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
The different choices I had to make but I realized

1045
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
That I could choose

1046
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
And

1047
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,888
Doesn't mean it doesn't get the better of me some days

1048
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
I also know it doesn't laugh

1049
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
I would say

1050
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:19,360
Happy I'm happy I'm also really sad sometimes I'm also really

1051
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,992
You know scared like before I came in here today I'm really anxious I'm really

1052
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Excited I'm really

1053
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,344
More feeling full and probably ever in my life

1054
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
I love that

1055
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392

Absolutely

1064
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Absolutely I think what's different

1065
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
Is now I know that

1066
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663

1067
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
I can look at it and I can just be with

1068
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
So if I'm anxious I can just say I'm anxious

1069
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
And it's okay

1070
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111

1071
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Pretend I'm not

00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
Be who I am

1074
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,791

For the company and in recent years

1078
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
She launched a program called Green Eileen

1079
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:26,431
The goal is to eventually you reuse or recycle almost all of the clothing

1080
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711

00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,759
Time now for how you built that

1089
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:07,135
And three story comes from Springfield Louisiana where are you

1090
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
One of these guys

1091
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,255
Their jet black sometimes they're a little bit modeled with some gray color

1092
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,631
They have spiky hair that sticks up on the back of their neck you know they have a long skinny snout

1093
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
And they just make a big

1094
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,471
Cacophony coming through the woods

1095
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
And what could he be talking about

1096
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Wild boars of course

1097
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
And in

1098
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,895
Springfield Louisiana where Charlie Munford lives

1099
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
These wild boars can cause a lot

1100
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,015
Of damage to nearby Farms

1101
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
They mess up

1102
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,111
Cornfields and soybeans and you know

1103
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Wheatfields

1104
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
They do

1105
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
Route up Levy's

1106
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,767
So they're very destructive so it's

1107
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
Probably important dimension

1108
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
At this point

1109
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Fat Charlie

1110
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
He's a butcher

1111
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:56,543
Will die in condition and harvest beef lamb pork and goats

1112
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Sure and Slaughter

1113
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,223
And Chef kept requesting while bored at first I was like I was kind of wacky you know no one does that but

1114
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
The to do just that

1115
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:10,879
Charlie actually created a program in partnership with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture

1116
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
Google legally Harvest

1117
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Wild boars

1118
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,327
And this was a really defining moment because we were essentially able to

1119
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
Harvest is delicious

1120
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Wild game

1121
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,543
And at the same time help our Farmers with the problem that they're facing managed in their land

1122
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
So the shaft

1123
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:33,151
Get their meat and Farmers fields are protective

1124
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
During the summer of 22

1125
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
16 Charlie back to work

1126
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
He built

1127
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:44,415
The smoker and he came up with a recipe for what is now Charlie's wild boar sausages

1128
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
We actually have a wood fireplace

1129
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,791
And we have seasoned Water Oak that we use

1130
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
You know it just makes a much

1131
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Richer flavor

1132
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
And we built the smoker

1133
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,055
Ourselves the stainless steel smoker that's Tina is about the size of a big pickup truck

1134
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
And we did about 50 rounds

1135
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:09,247
Of the recipe you know we just kept doing the recipe over and over and over and try and over and over again

1136
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
And out of the final product

1137
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,623
Well if you would think about how

1138
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
Beef taste in comparison to venison

1139
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:21,535
I mean it's a darker meat it's a it's a more aromatic

1140
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
Me

1141
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,423
And when you smoke it it gets just buttery and delicious this pass

1142
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,287
Spring Charlie started selling as wild boar sausages to local restaurants

1143
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Grocery stores

1144
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,895
And he had ambition to expand his customer base

1145
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,015
But the sausages aren't exactly cheap they're about $12 a pound

1146
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
We decided early on that since we are distinctive thing was going to be flavor and it's going to be a little bit more expensive

1147
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Nice smoked sausage we were going to need to literally get a sample into every person's mouth

1148
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:00,191
The first Charlie got culinary students to do some demos and that's okay.

1149
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Great okay

1150
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,335
So he decided to recruit some people who knew the product a little better

1151
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:12,735
We hired professional full-time chefs that really love our product and you know put them in the grocery store

1152
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:19,135
You're so they can speak the language of like this culinary ingredient that were using and the number of packs sold per

1153
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Damn it went from 7 to 35

1154
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
And today

1155
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,327
Charlie's selling his sausages in 70 stores around Louisiana Alabama

1156
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:33,727
And Mississippi and through his website he's starting to get orders from around the country in order from Hawaii

1157
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
Fulfillment company called me and they said Hey look it's going to cost like 80 bucks

1158
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Quarter to Hawaii

1159
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
