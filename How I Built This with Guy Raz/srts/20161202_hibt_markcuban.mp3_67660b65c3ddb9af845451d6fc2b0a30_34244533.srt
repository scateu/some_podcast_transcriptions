Hello

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
Mr. Mark Cuban I've left 17 messages

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
Running PR gets how I built this a show about

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Gators entrepreneurs idealist stories behind the movements they built

18
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
I'm guy Raz and Mark Cuban

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Was going to transform the economy in millions and then billions

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
The dollars

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
So if you know who Mark Cuban is

22
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,736
Probably seen him on Shark Tank

23
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Millionaire and billionaire investor and if

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,488
You don't know the show basically there's a panel of investors who are the sharks

25
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,584
And they hear a bunch of pictures from people who are trying to start a business

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
So do you like the idea

27
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
And would you want to see a net increase

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Appthority to 50% your company

29
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
Again what was my question to you

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
And I wouldn't Mark Cuban is doing the judging

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
Course I like the deal which is why I offered you a chance to close it

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
You should just shut up and take the deal

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
Hallelujah

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Instead of keep on selling

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
And you kept on trying to sell

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,744
Okay so this is the Mark Cuban that many of us are familiar with

37
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Self-made billionaire at 8

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
40 owner of

39
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
The Dallas Mavericks

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
But how he got to this point

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Here's the story

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
True like what

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
What was Mark Cuban like that day

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Graduate from college

45
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Paint that picture

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
Yeah I was a hustler I was an entrepreneur

47
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
I didn't know I remember I remember making a list

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Potential Industries I wanted to go into

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
I wrote them down

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Cable industry

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Technology

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
All these things that I thought would be up-and-coming Industries in

53
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
I was just going to start applying for jobs until I get home

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
And my first job out of college

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Was

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
At Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
Which I kind of backed into because they thought I had my MBA

58
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
But I didn't

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
I just taking all my MBA classes starting my freshman

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
And Indiana

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,368
Then they were kind of disappointed I didn't quite have the chops that they expected cash

62
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
So Batman

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Thanks for just going

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Through the process of

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
Converting from paper systems to

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Digital system

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
My job was to do systems integration we were system conversion

68
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
It's a nearly 80

69
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Yes

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
And so that's where I got my introduction to

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,336
Computers in really where I found that I really like computers I had really taken it at Indiana

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Yeah and then I quit

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
And when

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Why would I quit

75
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Just because I had no future there

76
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
It just wasn't for me I just was not a good employee but I tried to take initiative

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,184
I'm ever taking myself I'm going to have an impact and I'm going to try to do things differently to stand out

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
And I started writing a little newsletter

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
You don't think I'm lying you were on my

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
Why was there right now just like this in my mind that I'm going to have an impact I'm going to do what I think we're newsletter for like

81
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Other employees

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Yeah other employees at the bank then

83
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,544
If it plays out the banking of the bank we're doing the conversion for

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
And I had

85
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Lots of humor in it

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
And it was hysterical I if I have to say something

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
Pad

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
Then all of a sudden they got back to my direct boss who basically had

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Just dismiss me once I find I did have an MBA

90
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
And he just tore me a new one you just rip me

91
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Just like anime

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Okay I don't belong here

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
Cuz he thought you were like this annoying

94
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
AppStar kid who was just yes kind of going over his head

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,447
Yeah basically it's like who the hell you think you are

96
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
The only use that nice the language in

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Oh yeah

98
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Ruskin

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
So how did you end up in Dallas when your kid from Pittsburgh went to school in Indiana

100
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
I had a bunch of buddies from IU who went down there and they said the weather is amazing the girls are hot and the economy is getting better

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
Could you got to remember when I graduate graduate from Indiana

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
I mean it was not a good time you know there's a recession and this

103
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Free PC

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
And a bunch of my buddies had

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
Went down to Dallas and said you got to come check

106
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
So what did you think you were going to do down there

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
I know idea

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
I had no idea

109
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
I figured worst case I have fun

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Started to borrow my senior year in college so I knew how to bartend

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
I understood the bar business

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,183
Worst case I get a job working as a bartender

113
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
And then see what came along in

114
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
And that's exactly what I did I got to

115
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
A job at a place called a Lawns working as a bartender

116
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
And in the meantime

117
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
I would go through the help wanted ads

118
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
There is an ad in the local paper that

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Said come to

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
This agency

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
And will help you place and I might look him up

122
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Paying a fee

123
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Look like now the employer pays don't worry so

124
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,319
I got sent to a company called your business software and they started quiz me

125
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
And actually smart questions but it was

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
You know

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
What do you know about PCS and this was 1982 at this point

128
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
I might he sees we're not as saying no

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
People did not have their own computer no no no nobody

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Right it was brand new

131
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
And I was like I don't know a lot

132
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
But what I do know

133
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Is

134
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
How to open up a manual

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
And read and teach myself and gave him the examples of what I taught myself at Mellon Bank yeah I got a job for a teen

136
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
10 grand a year +

137
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Your business software

138
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
And so what did you have to do for the company like who is your ex

139
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
Cool job my job was it was a retail store

140
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
And my job was to get there

141
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
And open the store by 9:30

142
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Have all the PCS dusted the windows

143
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Cleaned

144
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
I'm set up the software and then

145
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,935
Learn all the software that we were selling so that when people came in I could answer the

146
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
So you just anchor and

147
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
Read the manual Natalie

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,663
I figured that's how I taught myself everything yeah cuz I actually tried to buy a TRS-80 from RadioShack

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
And I didn't get approved for

150
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Accredited

151
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,015
Already had my Sears credit card in my

152
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Discover Card taken in

153
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
And cut up

154
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
It's okay

155
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Since I can't afford to buy my own PC

156
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,999
I would stay there late or I would take one of them home and just

157
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Crunch the hours and teach myself

158
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,911
Were you a good salesman I needed you like are you kidding me I would

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
The best

160
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
I crushed it

161
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
How are you the best

162
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,615
One of my strengths is always been being able to put myself in the shoes of

163
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Any type of business

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
You got shoe store okay

165
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
I understand how that works you got a bank understand how that works

166
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
You got you know an oil refinery I'll figure out how that works

167
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,927
And so if I'm able to figure out how the business works and what makes a profitable

168
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
Then I'm able to

169
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
You don't figure out how to apply the soft words

170
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
To solve a problem in

171
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
The thing about the industry back then was it was brand new to everybody that's what I would tell people

172
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
It was so new to everybody that if I put in the time to learn it

173
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
I can stay ahead of everybody in new stuff was coming out everyday I'm but you know not as much as you see the day with apps and everything

174
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
What new stuff was coming out everyday

175
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,783
It wasn't that hard if I put in the time to keep up with

176
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Was that your plan like

177
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Just keep working for the

178
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
This company or whatever comes

179
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
We came along

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
No might my plan with I knew I was not going to be an employee long-term

181
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
New York

182
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
Do Your Own Thing

183
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
I just just who I am

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
You know who I was

185
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
My entire life

186
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
I mean I read that you

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
If you wanted to be rich from Herman

188
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
So what

189
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
What what did you do

190
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
I just tried

191
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
You know from

192
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,183
Packaging baseball cards when I was 9 or 10 years old and taking him down to the park and reselling them

193
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,791
Mark and I'm up you know buying and selling stamps and garbage bags door to door

194
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Getting together a crew of kids in

195
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Selling candy door-to-door

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
I mean I remember thinking when I was 11 years old

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
I'm literally looking out the window in our house

198
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
If I hustled I can I can move out of this house and take care of myself

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Pay my own bills

200
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Wow

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
11

202
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
What's a realistic

203
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Good salad and once I learned that

204
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Selling was about helping people

205
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Then it it almost became

206
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Easy

207
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
And then it was just a question of effort

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
How did you

209
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
How did you start your first company

210
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
And how old are you

211
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
First I got fired from your business software because I went

212
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
And

213
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
I sold a deal that was going to make me a $1,500 Commission

214
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
And

215
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
The customer wanted me to

216
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
You'll come pick up the check in the morning so that they could get started as quickly as possible

217
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
And so I said yes

218
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
And then I told my boss look

219
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Additional disk I want Kevin

220
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
Kevin wants me to come

221
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Pick up the check

222
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Now cuz I want to get started like know you've got to open up

223
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Store

224
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
I'm I got Barbara doing that

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
I know you got to open

226
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
The store

227
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,423
And so I made the executive decision to go pick up the check thinking

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
But I handed them to check

229
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
I would be okay if you fired me

230
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Soaps what would you do

231
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
You know I took my commission

232
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Because I was fired I went and

233
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Took some other customers I was working with

234
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
And started a company called micro Solutions

235
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Describe what Microsoft

236
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
What does it actually do

237
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
We're sitting generator

238
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
So what's that worth

239
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
What that means is we would take software

240
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
And we would modify it to your particular business need

241
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
Install it and stay with it till it works

242
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
So you were just doing this on your own with just you

243
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
I had a partner that

244
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Help do some software development Martin Woodall

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
And he basically did our Counting

246
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
But more importantly he was organized

247
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Izzy know he was anal as they come

248
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
His organizational skills is really wet

249
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
It really helped us because I didn't have to worry about the accounting getting done

250
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Checks getting ready

251
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
And all that kind of stuff

252
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
How did you get people to hire you how did you and would you go door-to-door would you call Kyle I would network-1 successful at

253
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
To another

254
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
And so

255
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
I went to a company

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Call architectural lighting who I'd be

257
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Been talking to

258
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
I said look your software cost you five hundred bucks

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
I don't have the money to to buy from the wholesaler

260
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
If you guys would Advance me the money

261
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
I won't charge you anything to install it

262
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
And I promise you that I'll make it working

263
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
If for some reason it doesn't

264
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Then I will read

265
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
You work for you or figure out a way to give you the money back

266
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
And they did and it worked

267
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,999
And then I went to the next one in the next one the next one and you got to realize that you know

268
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
My personality is such

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
That

270
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
I would start

271
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
Learning software working on an application that I was riding

272
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
And I start working on it

273
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
And I look up and it be 36 hours later

274
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Use the workaholic

275
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Not even a workaholic it's just went when

276
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
I didn't look at it so, try to work 24 36 hours or whatever

277
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
I looked at it's a saying okay this is

278
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,087
This is fascinating this is intellectually challenging I want to solve this problem

279
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
And if I don't do it I'm not going to get paid and I'm going to lose all this time

280
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
So solve the problem in and that's what I would do and

281
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
You know the thing about programming

282
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,863
Yo you concentrate so so so so hard

283
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
That time flies

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
So as as the company grew and end

285
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Became more successful

286
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
When did you think okay

287
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Pizzetta I've made it

288
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
I remember being

289
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
20

290
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
6

291
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
And being at a bar with my buddy

292
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Leaning back and going

293
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
I have $100,000 in the bank

294
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
Never my wildest dreams did I think I would have

295
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
$100,000

296
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
But then it got no business kept on growing and things got to get better

297
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
And then I remember having $800,000 in

298
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
This is the 80s

299
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
And getting an offer to sell the comfy

300
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Yes

301
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
And who was it

302
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
If you member company CompuServe by chance of course and they were part of H&R Block and so we sold it to copy

303
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
You serve and named it The Copy Service

304
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Systems integration group

305
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Sold it for 6 million dollars

306
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Gave a chocolate to my employees

307
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Ended up with two million

308
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
And Martin it up

309
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
2 million

310
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
And boom

311
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
Sea salt company for 6 million

312
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
You walk away with

313
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
2 million and then you got

314
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Local taxes

315
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Course

316
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
So you're like in your early 30s

317
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
No that just turned 30

318
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
And I remembered

319
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
Bunny the stockbroker Raleigh Ross

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
And telling them I want to invest like a 60 year old man

321
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Because why

322
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
And what I taught my

323
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
I read this book how to retire at the age of 35

324
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
That was like a book I kept on my desk

325
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
That was my mission

326
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,231
You're an in this book how to retire at the age of 35 the whole theme was

327
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
If you look like a student you know

328
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Yell and Save

329
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
A million-and-a-half dollars

330
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Who are you living like a student

331
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
You can live a long time just like this and

332
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
And really enjoy your life and and that's what that was my mission

333
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
What happened along the way was

334
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Raleigh was at Goldman Sachs

335
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
And

336
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
Because I knew the technology business and low query networking business

337
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
I started getting questions from all there

338
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Analyst

339
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Like like what kind of questions

340
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Yeah you just installed this synoptics router

341
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,071
Tell me about it what do you think about it what works and I knew the intricate details of Aldi's

342
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
All this hardware and software

343
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
And so

344
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
You know I'm like

345
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,263
Wait a minute these guys are using my information to make decisions on the quality of these companies and stock

346
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
Well maybe I should start doing that too

347
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
And and so I started buying these stocks

348
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
And and selling stocks just based off of my knowledge of the companies and knowledge of the products

349
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
And I was

350
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Feeling it

351
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
I mean literally you know over the next

352
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
For years I made 20 some million dollar

353
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Chess pie

354
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Buying selling sex with a $2000000 yes

355
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
Like I'm assuming at this point you have nothing to worry about

356
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Yeah I just said

357
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
I'd worry about not screwing it up

358
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,751
What you were still at worried about screwing up at that point

359
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Trust me I had a healthy.

360
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Dosa fear

361
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
You know every business I started I would count the months

362
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,967

Mark Cuban

414
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Himself

415
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Computer program

416
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Started a software consulting company

417
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
For a few million

418
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
And was

419
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Officially retired

420
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
At the age of 35

421
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
But that retirement

422
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
Did not last long because in the mid-1990s

423
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Mark Cuban wound up starting

424
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Another business

425
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
So what was

426
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,559
So my college buddy Todd Wagner came and we should get together all the time

427
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
Eyebrows retired so I was the guy

428
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Let's go to lunch and have a drink

429
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Yeah

430
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
So we we get together is like look

431
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
He's got to this other guy he knows who's

432
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
Doing this thing with pagers to try to get Sports

433
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
Audio transmitted to pagers and I'm like

434
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Now that's crazy

435
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
I'm like what

436
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Indiana Bass

437
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
Right now we try to listen to Indiana basketball

438
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
We would have to have somebody in Bloomington Indiana

439
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Hold

440
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,255
I found a phone yeah with to the radio right and then we will listen to it on the other side here in Dallas

441
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Crazy

442
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
There's got to be a way this new internet and I've been playing with the internet

443
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
I might just got to be

444
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
A way that I can figure out how to

445
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
No transmit audio

446
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
And eventually video over the internet

447
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
So that we can solve that

448
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Right now that

449
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,175
Totally obvious right but at that time like in the mid-nineties

450
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Did people think this way

451
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Was a good idea

452
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
No hell no people were laughing

453
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
Fire by them radio

454
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
What was the technology was a technology even there

455
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
No it wasn't at that point but I figured I could

456
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Can figure it out and we were

457
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,863
I was playing with NFS files all this other stuff on here you know I went and bought

458
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Appelt Backpacker belt

459
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Computer for 3 Grand

460
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Set up an ISDN line of my house

461
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
And

462
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
Just started playing and playing and playing and try and if

463
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
Thanks and there were ways using wav files

464
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
Stop that you could transmit audio that been done for a long time

465
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
But actually streaming it

466
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
And over the internet

467
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
In a more efficient manner that hadn't

468
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
So I set up a website

469
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
And

470
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,535
Ricotta Daddy net and then we went to the local a local radio station here in Dallas klif

471
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
I went to a Master Lock

472
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
You know how cable TV is just blown up

473
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
And now you can get any Network anywhere

474
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Do you have a TV

475
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
I think this internet thing is going to do the same thing for audio in the bed

476
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Anjali video

477
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
That you're going to be able to stream

478
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Things digitally

479
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
All around the world and we're going to really make the world a much smaller place

480
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
And you can make your signal

481
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
How much more Global does

482
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
And

483
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
We here's what we need

484
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
To do I want to bring an eight-hour VCR

485
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
And we're going to record your Norm hitzges show and

486
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767

00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
And then I'm going to coat it

488
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
And put it on Audiomack

489
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Soap soap

490
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
What did were people to people start listening

491
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

492
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263

And we started getting emails

00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
All around the world

495
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615

Bliss Carnival

505
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,431
You are a multi-millionaire at this point like you are sitting like burning the midnight oil like sitting

506
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
In front of a glowing screen night after night after night

507
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Why were you doing that

508
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
That's who I am cuz I wanted to win

509
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,695
Right away what's that mean

510
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Against what against to against

511
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
You will a new a new streaming was the future

512
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Who is no doubt in my mind

513
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
And

514
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Beyond that that's who I was I mean I like the idea

515
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,495
Of your Peewee said I could see around corners what's next what's new

516
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
What's next

517
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
And there was no doubt in my mind that streaming was neck

518
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
And I are members telling our employees

519
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:09,247
We're either going to be a multibillion-dollar company or we're just going to be friends and was going to be a big flame

520
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
But streaming is going to be

521
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
In Norman and we have a

522
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
How are you

523
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Making a profit

524
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,744
We wanted to say I failed on my teeth every bimonthly

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,096
Profitability goals

526
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
But it was it was really obvious to me that

527
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
This is going to be huge

528
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Enormous

529
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
If only just to reach

530
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Offices because

531
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
There was no other way to get media at your desktop

532
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah you could have a TV there

533
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
And most people can have radios there

534
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,528
And so we were the media device and people were putting media

535
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
PCS on every desktop

536
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
And yeah you had the the Broadband width of Corporation

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
It was a perfect storm for us we just had to have the Conch

538
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
And so we just kept on

539
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
Growing and growing and growing

540
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
And so I went out racing money from

541
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Friends

542
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
It was like what are we going to Value this company at

543
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Blackwell

544
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
The last company

545
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
I sold

546
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
After 7 years for 6 million

547
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Let's just cut that in half

548
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
3000000 that'll be a valuation

549
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
That's all we sold

550
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,808
Yo 1% chunks for $30,000 to

551
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Four friends

552
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
When we sold the company

553
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,928
Those $30,000 chunks for Worth 22 million-dollar

554
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
You sold the company to Yahoo for how much 5.7 billion is

555
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Got your key so what's up what percent of the company did you order that

556
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
When you sold at 33%

557
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
In 1999

558
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
Yes actually close in mm

559
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Okurrr

560
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Billionaire

561
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
And you're thinking okay now and retire

562
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
Yeah kind of

563
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
Pretty much did you start to think about

564
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Finally

565
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
The Dallas Mavericks

566
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
I didn't I didn't know how that came about was

567
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
It was

568
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
October

569
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
We're early November of 1999

570
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
And I've been Dallas Mavericks season ticket holder for

571
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
A few years

572
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
And I'm ever going to the game started the 99

573
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
2000 season

574
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
And

575
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
It wasn't a sellout

576
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
And I was excited

577
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
But nobody else was

578
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
And I'm never looking around thinking

579
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
I can do a better job

580
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Nas with my girlfriend

581
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
My wife

582
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
And I'm never telling her

583
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Do a better job then

584
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Yo ding ding ding the light bulb went off on

585
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
I can put my money where my mouth is

586
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,632
And so that's exactly what I did I talk to my cells rap and put me Tech meghani Mark McGwire

587
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Who was the former player working

588
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Champiro ice Pro Junior the owner

589
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Connected with Ross

590
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,312
Didn't even negotiate I just said you know what whatever

591
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
And pay them

592
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
285 which

593
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
Probably a hundred million

594
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,200
But yeah it wasn't like it was preordained

595
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
Plan that was my all-time goal

596
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,576
It was I was I've always been a basketball Junkie of always love the game

597
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
Play pickup I still play pickup

598
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
It's in my blood in

599
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
It always just

600
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Seem like why not

601
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,072
So what you say you paid a hundred million too much

602
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,704
What about the Mavs everybody like are you an idiot it was the highest price ever paid for a sports team

603
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
285 million dollars that everybody thought I was a moron

604
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
I need some so crazy now because of NBA teams are words like

605
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Amazon billion

606
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Dollars

607
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,200
I asked you about the NBA because

608
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
You get in a lot of trouble

609
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Like you have been fined

610
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
A lot of money for

611
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
For like yelling at the ref so do you

612
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
Did you cause trouble for fun or do you

613
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
You stupid cuz you like

614
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
The fight

615
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Just depends on the circumstance

616
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
If I'm playing pickup or if I'm playing in the in a league

617
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
I'm never arguing over calls or whatever and never have

618
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
Family Guy and there's a bad call okay

619
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
That's the way it goes

620
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Yo in the NBA it's a lot differently when I first got

621
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
There when I first got to the NBA

622
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,968
Rep really work at managing the game

623
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
Rather than calling the game by the rules

624
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
And

625
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
I remember early on

626
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,416
Reading something from the director of officiating back then who said

627
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
We don't call the game

628
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
The same in the last minute

629
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
As we do in the first

630
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Winchester

631
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
Infuriated me to no end

632
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
And then from there it was just like okay

633
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
I'm on a mission to

634
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
To make this Fair

635
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
And

636
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Set me off

637
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
With a lot of those guys

638
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
And probably cost me a championship in 2006

639
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
But

640
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
It was come a long way since and I think

641
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
You know I'm there for the NBA's better

642
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
Did you kiss sometimes you yell at that

643
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Rhapsody

644
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,600
That that's my spot you know whether to be honest

645
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
If you just see me

646
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
Outside of game

647
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Imus Mellows you

648
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
You can be glad you're not like an angry guy

649
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
No don't have many reasons

650
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
No. I have no reason to

651
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Majority game

652
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
That's where I let out my

653
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
It's like when I played

654
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Let's play rugby

655
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,872
Like Joyner rugby game I'm going to try to beat the hell out of you and then we'll drink afterwards for that was where I let out my

656
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
And doing a math game you'll see me yell and scream

657
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
You know that's my

658
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
My stress

659
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
It is at the same thing on Shark Tank because you can

660
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
You catching because I'm me and

661
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Essence

662
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
Yeah right what why is that

663
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
If there's an entrepreneur who's got their life tied up in something I'm not

664
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
But I'm going to be so

665
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Supportive and I'll come up

666
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
What suggestions even if I'm not in

667
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Are you trying to scare me

668
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
If you're trying to pull a quickie

669
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
Or your products

670
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
The scam

671
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
I'm going to nail you

672
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
Because I don't

673
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,664
I know that people see these products and no go to buy them

674
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Yeah we had one on the end of the season where is Kyle pavlakis

675
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Where

676
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
They had a

677
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Fitbit looking device

678
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
That shot

679
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
And the whole idea was

680
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Aversion therapy

681
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,280
So that if you don't want to smoke you shock yourself when you're getting ready to shut the

682
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Set the smoke

683
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
Shock yourself when you getting ready to eat

684
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Yeah whatever it is that you're trying to avert

685
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
And it would train your brain

686
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
And when they tried to show the science

687
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
Leave all the signs for aversion therapy in general

688
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
But nothing specific

689
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Picture their product and I called him out on it

690
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
And I was like

691
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
Okay why you just use a rubber band

692
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
You know it snap yourself

693
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
When you

694
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
You're going to smoke

695
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
And so

696
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Those situations Almanac

697
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,696
If your hearts in it when your heart's in the right place and your efforts there

698
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
I'm going to support

699
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
You've invested

700
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Like almost $29 I guess

701
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Skin

702
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Company made money yet off of any of those

703
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,448
If I got 20 million dollars back

704
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Have I gotten

705
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,848
You know if I was going to Value it when I have more than 20 million of value absolutely

706
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,688
Do out of the seventy give or take companies that I've invested in

707
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
I'd say

708
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Tore out of business

709
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
Tore out of business and just aren't smart enough to know it

710
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
And then the next

711
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
You know the top

712
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
12

713
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,464
That are making 500000 or more in profit

714
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Per year

715
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
And have paid me back a lot of money or

716
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
It reinvesting

717
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
A lot of that money into growth

718
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
Then there's others in the middle that are just growing in

719
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
And running their businesses the way they should in

720
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
You know we'll see if they click and take off or not

721
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Yashow market

722
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Amazing because

723
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Unlike other people who been on the show

724
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
It doesn't seem like

725
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
Becoming a billionaire was

726
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Weird to you

727
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,368
And like all of a sudden you're weird trust me was it

728
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
It is so much money to this day wears

729
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,792
Yeah it is crazy I mean I knew I'd be wealthy you knew that you just knew it

730
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Yeah

731
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Look I mean from the time I was

732
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
25 on

733
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,448
I was making money and saving money I'm in

734
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Increasing my net worth

735
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
You know on a monthly basis

736
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
But to this day

737
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,640
I meant I mean yesterday I remember being in my backyard and

738
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
My kids were there

739
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
And just thinking

740
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
You know I never would have imagined

741
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
Never in a million years would I have imagined

742
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
I said that I'd be in this

743
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
Position

744
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
You know I'm just trying to appreciate it is crazy

745
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
If you woke up tomorrow

746
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
I found out that

747
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Everything was gone

748
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Are you money

749
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Welfare

750
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
House like

751
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
What you had to start over what would you

752
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
At what you do

753
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
I get a job as a bartender at night and a sales job during the day

754
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
It's not working

755
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
And probably

756
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Yeah because I be a billionaire that built up to be a billionaire you got to get a life

757
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
Right I started my company

758
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,808
Yo at a time when the stock market was going

759
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
And that that was my luck

760
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
And I was smart enough to do it smart enough to run it

761
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
Smart enough to execute on its smart enough to head yet

762
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
But no question there was luck involved

763
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
Oven so how could I become a multi-millionaire

764
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Millionaire again

765
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
I have no doubt

766
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
On cuz I work hard enough

767
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
And I

768
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
Look and I don't mean that to sound disrespectful there's a lot of people who work

769
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Really hard

770
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
But in sales

771
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Annoying

772
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
What my sales skills are in

773
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
The products that I'm able to

774
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
The cell

775
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,832
I think I could find a job selling a product that had enough

776
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Commissions are rewards for me

777
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
And then leverage that out to start a company somewhere somehow

778
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
And then

779
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Build some wealth

780
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Now maybe not the same

781
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
But enough

782
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Peterbilt

783
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,800
Mark Cuban is the owner of the Dallas Mavericks

784
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Many years he really wanted to learn how to dunk a basketball like Michael Jordan any tried and train the tribe

785
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,296
And at the age of 37 after years of training

786
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112

You need to do

810
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Out of the way

811
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Here's this week

812
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Big story

813
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
So my name is Marty Peters and I live in Gastonia North Carolina

814
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Charlotte

815
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
Where Marnie works as a massage therapist

816
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,528
Money is a flight from North Carolina to Maryland and she was with her two little kids

817
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
And where kids

818
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Was her baby son was swaddle to her chest

819
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:01,280
And rather kids are 18 month old daughter was strapped into the seat beside her and she was demanding to play with her

820
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,352
Toys and each toy gave her she drop on the ground

821
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,264
And because I had my son wrapped around me I couldn't bend down and get them

822
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
The toys keeps slipping up the tray table in rolling down the aisle or crayons and stuffed animals and figure

823
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
All over the plane and so as I was sitting there closing my eyes going okay what

824
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
It would help me in the situation

825
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
I started to make this product in my head and what came to mind is the least

826
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Was an inflatable lap tray

827
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
For kids

828
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
But the more that we travel the more I realize that they need a place to put their things that they need a pillow that they

829
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
They have to be able to carry it themselves a bag a pillow a tray table

830
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,456
All-in-one took money started to sketch out some ideas

831
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
She went to friends and family she raised about

832
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
$20,000

833
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
And then

834
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
She went looking for a manufacturer and there was really only one company that was willing to work with me as a small

835
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Inventor

836
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
And

837
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,400
They were marvellous for 18 months we went back and forth with samples and prototypes

838
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
And finally came to an agreement this pass

839
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Spring

840
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
And

841
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
Was able to

842
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,128
Actually get the first shipments at the end of August

843
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
And marnie's invention she calls it pet pack that's p e t e p a k

844
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
It is a stuffed animal that you unzip the belly and it's a lap tray and you can zip the

845
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
The back of its neck and it has a little pack that you can put your books in your Trinkets and toys

846
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,728
And then you can turn it over and it becomes a little pillow Transformer

847
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
Right now there are four designs is an elephant's a panda a lion and a pig it's a pharmacy says

848
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
50 of them mainly Amazon everyone really wants to see me succeed and because
