112
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
You really

113
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
Grew up in Washington DC as it is a kid right

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Yeah pretty much

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,639
My dad was involved in political Administration so we lived in Sacramento

116
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
He was

00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
Pat Brown's press secretary this is Jerry's father

118
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
That gives you a sense of how old I am

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
And

120
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Pat lost

121
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
To Ronald Reagan

122
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,095
And so we moved to Washington DC because Lyndon Johnson was

123
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
The president

124
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423

125
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191

126
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Ministration

127
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
And I I read that as a child

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
He's very small child

129
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
You were taken to like

130
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
Pretty big rallies like even the MLK March on Washington what you must have been

131
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Did you were you taken there as a kid

132
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,879
We didn't go to the MLK March I did March

133
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
With Cesar Chavez

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
In the

135
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
You know San Joaquin Valley

136
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
And then we

137
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Did later marches on washing

138
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
So as a kid

139
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Pretty

140
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Solidly liberal

141
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
Yeah and also with a real bear

142
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
4

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Community

144
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
Organizing activism you know we did go to March

145
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
And we did

146
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
My mom was a social worker

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
And she work

148
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Chicken child protection

149
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
So occasionally we would have kids in our house that

150
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Had no place

151
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
To go so

152
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Yeah

153
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
And

154
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
As a kid growing up in a house that was

155
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Really about policy and and and

156
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,007
Child protection of things like that did you talk about entrepreneurial stuff and it wasn't even

157
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Looking glamorous

158
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
In your in your mind at all

159
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
No

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
.

161
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
I think it's good to set a tiny bit of context because I think

162
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,159
Business is different today than it might have been that I'm not sure of that

163
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,767
You know the profit motive was something to be a little bit

164
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Suspicious cells

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Business was not something

166
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
That our people did

167
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
You

168
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
You went to a quaker High School

169
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Did that

170
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Like to have

171
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
Any influence on you or was it just sort of you know the

172
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Three four years and

173
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Kind of moved on

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
I actually think it had a profound

175
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
Influence on Me George Fox

176
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,671
Who is the father of American quakerism

177
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
Had a saying that was on the wall of our

178
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Of our cafeteria which is let your life speak

179
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
And so

180
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
You know that notion every day we had

181
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,543
Chores that we had to do an everyday we went to meeting and

182
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
And that notion of

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Sort of

184
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
Attending to the collective

185
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
To the community

186
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
Really Randy panda

187
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,855
Little lot of sense to your DCU Washington DC graduate high school

188
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
How did you end up

189
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
In Colorado

190
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
What's the story

191
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
I graduated from high school when I was 16 and I lived

192
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,119
For a little while outside of DC with some roommates

193
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,263
And I had a friend who lived in Fort Collins and I thought well I had $100

194
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
I have $100 and I have a car

195
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
And I have a friend icon

196
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Can stay with

197
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
And I

198
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,319
Packed up my Volvo 544 the turtle back one

199
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
And

200
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
I always knew

201
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
When I moved from Sacramento to DC

202
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
Did I was more of a western person and I wanted to move back to the West

203
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
So this will be like the late 70s

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
You go to

205
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
Takara move to Fort Collins

206
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
On July 10th

207
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
1976

208
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
And

209
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Soon after that enrolled

210
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
If University know I did that over several years

211
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Later I went on the south

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Paying

213
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
Plan I was raised to be really

214
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:33,279
Self-sufficient and competent than I just kind of decided I wanted to do that

215
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
So when you were when you got to college what did you think you you were going to do

216
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
With your life

217
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Start a brewery

218
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
Yeah I know I didn't really know but my family were

219
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,319
Big Believers in a liberal arts education I'm a big believer

220
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
Labor in a liberal arts education I think it makes you a good thinker

221
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,535
And so it really didn't matter to me what I was going to do it matter to me

222
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
That I

223
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Had that experience

224
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
So when you graduated what did you order

225
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
I started

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
Working as a social worker and a

227
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,823
Program for low-income single parents

228
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
In Fort,

229
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
In Fort Collins and a town close by

230
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Did you like it

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
I did

232
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Did I miss it

233
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
When I started in this

234
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Not so much

235
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
It's a minute

236
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
It's

237
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Tough workwear

238
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
But I would say that social work is a generalist

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,071
Degree so you learn a lot about a lot of working with

240
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
People and it's also systems theory

241
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
And those two things were the

242
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Perfect setup

243
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
For the next

244
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Tell me how you you're in Fort Collins

245
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Cats right early 80s

246
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
When

247
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
And how did you meet

248
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Jeff Levin

249
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
We met a few times through friends

250
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
And then we met at a party

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,487
He and we just sort of started like hey you want to go on a hike and

252
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
But you did that Bond over beer or any

253
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Like that not the first time but the first sort of

254
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Date we had

255
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
He brought us

256
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Pack of beer

257
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
Oh nice very romantic

258
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
And what like what was Jeff doing up

259
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Jeff

260
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Is an electrical engineer

261
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
And he was doing bench

262
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Top

263
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
Engineering I can give you sort of some bla bla bla words

264
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
But they mean almost nothing to me

265
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Yeah

266
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,975
He was testing machines

267
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
And

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
So you guys started dating and

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
You hit it off

270
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Obviously you liked him and

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
How long do you have between the time you met him in the time you guys

272
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Decide to get married

273
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Almost 2 years

274
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
Answer you I guess you're in your 20s

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
I was

276
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
31 ish

277
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
So you are

278
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Doing social work

279
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Jeff is

280
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Testing machines out in a way we don't

281
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
Quite understand the story particular

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,519
I guess we're around the time you met him around the time you really started dating

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
He had just

284
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Come back

285
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
From a trip to

286
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Belgium is that

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
And he took

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
One of his mountain bikes

289
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
With him on that trip

290
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
And that's how fat tire github

291
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Name he tried a beer

292
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,439
And he was a home Brewer and he'd started winning awards for his Homebrew

293
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
And

294
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,143
He started brewing a beer that was to emulate a beer that he had there

295
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
And he named It Fat Tire is a Homebrew which is kind of a common Homebrew thing

296
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
2

297
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Try to give things clever names

298
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
When we started the brewery people say

299
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
Oh my God you cannot name that beer Fat Tire that is the worst name ever here like that

300
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Take our chances with

301
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
This one

302
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
Explain explain to me when he

303
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
He comes back on a bike trip

304
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
And he starts to

305
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
Try and emulate this Belgian beer

306
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,935
What did he say to you what was your impression of it like what made it

307
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Unique

308
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,079
But you have to remember again kind of take yourself back

309
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,943
Many of you probably weren't drinking beer then but it take yourself back to that time

310
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Where beer was still really kind of

311
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
You know the drink of the knucklehead and it was there was not you didn't think about what glassware

312
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
Where do you want to put your beer in or what might you eat with the beer

313
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
It was

314
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
We would go to parties and we will bring some beer and people tell that's okay you know we have a keg of

315
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
Coors Light or something and

316
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
It was really kind of an uphill

317
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
To convince people

318
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
That beer with

319
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Flavor

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
And you know

321
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
What do I want to say though because

322
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,815
The big to Brewers in this country make technically excellent

323
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Beer

324
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
And I never want

325
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
To sort of discount that because

326
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
They're very

327
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Skilled at it

328
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
But they're not

329
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Craft Brewers

330
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
And they don't

331
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Really have sort of that

332
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
Got feel for how you might

333
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Start a movement

334
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Where people are talking

335
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Sing about what am I going to drink with that and

336
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
But I'm trying to understand how did Jeff

337
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Convince you I mean

338
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Clearly he knew about beer he was brewing it

339
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
But

340
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
How did you how are you convinced that this

341
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
Belgian beer he was making a special

342
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
The beer was good

343
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,335
We had not yet had they were going to start this Brewery conversation but that conversation

344
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
We were

345
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
Sort of right at the Crux of being

346
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Married

347
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
And I just remember thinking

348
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
There is no way

349
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
That I'm going to stay to my brand new husband know you have to go to that bench top

350
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
Do that thing you do whatever it is because we have to have this paycheck it's like sure

351
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
Let's try this thing went to UNI said hey Kim

352
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
I want to brew this beer

353
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
And like

354
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Sell it

355
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
I want to start a brewery

356
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Yeah

357
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
And you said okay

358
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Where

359
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,271
Right well that was so so we took a second mortgage out on our house

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
A big leap

361
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
Just saying sure let's take a second mortgage

362
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
With no

363
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Like

364
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
Worried about you know I wasn't worried about it I always felt like we had these daytime gigs

365
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
And we could always go back

366
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
To those if we needed to

367
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
And this seemed like a really

368
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
Fun interesting challenging

369
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
The part that I maybe didn't

370
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
White Factory in is

371
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
The first few years of our marriage

372
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Which would be totally mm

373
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Absorbed in

374
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Stainless steel and hops

375
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Send mop plzen

376
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
You know I that part I did

377
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
Didn't yet have a fix on

378
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
So you decide to take a second mortgage what did you need the money to do cuz this was still going to fill this out

379
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
And your home is filled the basement and then the Builder base floors above it and Jeff designed all of our own

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
Initial equipment so that saved a lot of money we had a

381
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
Dairy manufacturer in Denver fabricated for us the door to the

382
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
The basement was too small when we got

383
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
The first equipment in so we had to cut the door out

384
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
So we could get the equipment in

385
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,119
And wizard Vision like did you just sit down and say okay we're going to Brutus fear of the basement

386
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,007
And make some money and then get bigger and bigger and bigger or was it just like yeah let's

387
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
Peruvian are basement to see what happens this is fundamental to our story before Jeff

388
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
F&I ever made a barrel of beer we went on a hike

389
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,599
Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park can we said we were going to be for thing

390
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
We were going to produce world-class belgian-style beers

391
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,767
We were going to be environmental stewards

392
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
We were going to promote beer culture

393
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
And we were going to have fun

394
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
And you'll notice there was nothing in there about co-workers and there was nothing in there about customers

395
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Because at that point

396
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
We didn't have co-workers or customers

397
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
So it honestly didn't occur to me

398
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
Think about including them

399
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
So we get another

400
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
Pass through that cycle

401
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Significant pieces

402
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Mitchell hair

403
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Explain

404
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Both you and Jeff still had a job

405
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
Jeff did not I had a dragon

406
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
You and your day job

407
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
And

408
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
He was sort of like

409
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,519
Dealing with the beer brewing all day and then you would come home and

410
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Start to

411
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Deal with it at night

412
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Bottle beer

413
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
I would work 4 days a week I had good insurance and

414
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
We had one kid

415
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,135
Trying to have a second kid and so I had good insurance and we needed the cash flow and so I would work 4 days a week

416
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
And on the fifth day

417
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
I would call all of our cuss

418
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Stories in the morning

419
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,839
And say okay we have this beer in this beer in this beer what would you like

420
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
And it done in the afternoon

421
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
I would deliver all the beer

422
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,775
Who are your customers Hatton with a people who already kind of knew just reputation

423
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
They were both

424
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Bars and restaurants

425
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,991
Sand in Colorado beer Wine and Spirits are sold in independent Liquors

426
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Which stores which was key for us

427
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
That's because you could build a relation

428
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
And what would you do would you go door-to-door to the

429
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
These Bars and

430
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
With samples of the beer and say hey

431
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,303
Me and Jeff are making the spear and I'm can I

432
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Pour you some

433
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
At the time that we started there was a brew pub in Fort Collins

434
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
And there was a brewery that made draft beer

435
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
And so we decided to focus

436
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Unpackaged

437
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
It was a natural

438
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Because there was really

439
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Nothing

440
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
In the marketplace

441
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
In our part of the world

442
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Like that

443
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
So it was not

444
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Really hard

445
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Tell I would

446
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
Call in the morning deliver beer in the afternoon go pick up my kid from school and he would poor kid new the

447
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
Down by the liquor store

448
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
For a while

449
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
I do not have any idea how to make beer

450
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
How are you were you like

451
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Pouring beer

452
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,455
Two funnels in the bottles and capping the bottles one by one

453
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Well we were camping them one by one I mean it was a very bootstrap situation we

454
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415
Jeff actually designed

455
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
He built kind of

456
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Frame to put for bottles

457
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
With a

458
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Food grade

459
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Rubber tubing with a parasol

460
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,055
So it would push the beer into the bottles and it and so

461
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
At night I would also bottle and label beers

462
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Label each one and then you know pan cap

463
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
How similar is Fat Tire

464
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Today to what Jeff

465
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
What's brewing in 1991

466
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:43,231
Which generally very similar one of the things that I always wrote want to remind people though is that

467
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Beerus

468
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Food and agricultural

469
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Product

470
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
And so

471
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
You have

472
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56,031
Changes in the characteristic of a hop or The Malt bill because

473
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
You know it was a wet year it was a dry year so it really is an art form

474
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,807
That takes both the ability to

475
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,903
I have a gut instinct and a scientific mind

476
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
2

477
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
In the first year

478
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Presumably

479
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
There's a limit to how much beer you can make and sell right

480
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Well we were so small

481
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
That there was a limit

482
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
How much we could make

483
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
But we could have sold a lot more I mean

484
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
In Telluride Telluride Liquors had a sign

485
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
In the store that said if you're going to

486
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
Fort Collins will pay for your gas

487
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
If you stop at New Belgium

488
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
And pick up 10

489
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
In cases how did they find out was it just Word of Mouth

490
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Just you know you go to some festivals

491
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
What's you serve beer

492
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Ativan

493
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Send

494
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
So

495
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
In that in that first year 2

496
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
Did you ever have any anxiety over whether the

497
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
The thing wasn't going to work on it sounds like

498
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Love the beer like

499
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
He was getting a lot of attention and

500
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
You know people are driving for miles around

501
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Come and get it but

502
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
You know it's still tricky to run a business

503
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
That's right did you have any concern that

504
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
Maybe this thing might not work out

505
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
No my anxiety was more

506
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,400
If I had anxiety it was more keeping up with all the

507
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Because there was just a lot

508
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Do you know you start hiring

509
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
PeopleLink

510
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
In the beginning there walking

511
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
Through your living room later on WeMo

512
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Move to a second location

513
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
I did get pregnant

514
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
With our second

515
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Samsung

516
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,368
And the 1992 I think right 92

517
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
So

518
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
It's things like

519
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
We went to the Great American Beer Fest

520
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
In those days you served your own beer so

521
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
I served

522
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Beer

523
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
On Thursday Friday and

524
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
And Saturday

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
I had Nick on Wednesday

526
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,800
And we moved into our second

527
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
Brewery on the following Monday

528
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Wow

529
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
So

530
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Amazing

531
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
Hi thank you

532
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Look back and think those people must

533
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,952
Have been like oh my God don't let her give me any beer because she's

534
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
Going to explode here so yeah and

535
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
End

536
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,632
All of this was financed by

537
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
The second mortgage the money you guys

538
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Well once we weren't sure we were going to make payroll so I called my parents and asked if we could borrow five

539
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
$5,000 and they loaned US money

540
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
We

541
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
Took out some credit card

542
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
And those days they sent you things it said you've been pre-approved for a line of credit especially for engineer

543
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
Let's go for social worker

544
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
Some credit cards American Express at here

545
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
We did not ask him to make that little joke but

546
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
This live event is

547
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,504
Sponsored by a certain credit card companies take a quick break

548
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
I hear a bit from them

549
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
And when we come back

550
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Have you Belgium

00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
Introduce entrepreneurs to American Express

566
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
What are team was asked to build a booth at a

567
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Busy Tech trade show

568
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
They decided to go analog

569
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Typical trade show

570
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
So we said how come you take it offline how come we let people talk to each other

571
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
And have some fun

572
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
And we built off the buzz of the escape room trends

573
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,104
Where people are locked in a room and it was solve a series of clues in order to

574
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
We called it escape the office

575
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
The reason we created

576
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,064
Experiences that we do is because relationships are a part of everything that we do

577
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
We aim to build

578
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Long-term enduring relationships

579
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,792
In a world has become increasingly short-term and transactional and impersonal

580
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
And we hope that every experience

581
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
Our customers have with us will reinforce that given take

582
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,776
We want to be there for our customers and make sure the traveling for business

583
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Truly is a pleasure

584
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360

00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
Tell you about another podcast that I happen to host

591
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
It's called the TED Radio Hour

592
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Every week we go on a

593
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
A journey through the

594
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Biggest ideas

595

Emotions

596
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144

NPR one

600
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
Or wherever you get your pie

601
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
Welcome back to how I built this from NPR

602
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,112
Kim Jordan New Belgium from the basement

603
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
Into a new space and at that point

604
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,512
Kim finally quit her job as a social worker to focus on

605
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
Beer full-time and of course

606
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,144
They're doing all of this just as business partners

607
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
What is husband and wife

608
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
With two small children

609
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,824
What about like the dynamic of being parents

610
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Raising children

611
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,920
And also running this business I mean

612
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
How did you navigate that

613
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
Was it a clock

614
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
I also really

615
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
You have kids I kind of can't believe you fell for that it was a lot of

616
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,752
At work I wanted to be a mom I volunteer I was a soccer coach I volunteered in my kids

617
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
School I worked

618
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
The good news is as a

619
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,944
Self-employed person you can flex your schedule

620
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,296
And then you I would go to Kinko's at night and work on

621
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
Yellow marketing thing

622
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
What would Jeff

623
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
And both you and Jeff were to the company I mean

624
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
Did you argue or was it pretty

625
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
This is not therapy right

626
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
I'm just checking to see if

627
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
You know I'm like live reliving my past

628
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Sometimes we argued

629
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
And I would

630
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Say like

631
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
That is really a bad idea you know we really need to

632
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Try to

633
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Have have these

634
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Because there is a lot

635
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
You know

636
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Personal quirks

637
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Sure working styles

638
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Financial

639
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Pressure

640
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Hiring more

641
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
People

642
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Salat to do

643
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,168
Lot going on despite any attention I'm in the business

644
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Was growing I mean you were

645
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
You guys are winning Awards year

646
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Selling more beer

647
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
1995 you moved

648
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
2

649
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
A bigger current facility so

650
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
How by the way how are you

651
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
At this point financing the company all from

652
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Revenue

653
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
A lot

654
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,672
From revenue but also Traditional Bank Finance

655
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
So you didn't take

656
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,792
Take any outside which is also a fundamental thing for us

657
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,376
You know I understand in some organizations

658
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
People really need

659
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Disorder bringing outside advice

660
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Investors

661
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,592
But for us I really wanted to kind of have our destiny

662
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
In our own control and a bank doesn't want

663
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
To run your business

664
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
They want you

665
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
To run your business

666
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
As well

667
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
And pay them back hard to get a bank

668
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Yeah

669
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,208
We failed a couple of times I early on I

670
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Was putting

671
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
Together a plan

672
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
For the bank that we had been using personally

673
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,448
And they say well you know you also need to give us this so I would

674
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Put that together and give that to them is

675
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
As well

676
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,896
And our Banker said you know the way that you sort of dribble this

677
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Paperwork

678
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Again

679
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,320
Makes me think that you know nothing about running a business and I'm not even going to take your loan to the

680
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
The committee

681
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
So

682
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,208
So

683
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,840
So how are you it's eventually you were able to convince Banks to give you loans

684
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
Based on the fact that you were growing right and you were your revenues

685
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Who's growing

686
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,312
We did and we also built all of our own automation

687
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,432
Every single motherboard every solder every wire

688
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
Which was Jeff's

689
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Strength

690
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Back to that

691
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Benchtop thing I don't know so much about

692
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
Really good at that

693
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
And

694
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Because we had

695
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
How to cut

696
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,792
A couple of million dollars out of the total project

697
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
In order to

698
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
I feel comfortable

699
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
With the amount of money we were

700
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
We're borrowing you remember how much

701
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
That project

702
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,872
Well the building was about 10 million and then

703
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
The equipment was another 10 mil

704
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
What

705
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
Put this into context because

706
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
I guess around the mid-90s

707
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
The craft brewing

708
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Phenomenon really just started to

709
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
Explode

710
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,024
Did it feel like there was a wave that you guys

711
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
We're riding

712
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
You know we were at the front of the wave and we were leaders in the industry I

713
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
Have been a part of the

714
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
Community of

715
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,664
What is a movement in a lot of ways a lot of my very close friend

716
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Come from this industry

717
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
We go on vacation

718
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Together and

719
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
We check in with one another

720
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,624
And that's unusual I think inbiz

721
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
And

722
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,488
We had what we felt like was a really solid

723
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Management team we had a really great

724
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,120
Way of developing strategy

725
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,704
So you know 96 we were 5 years old

726
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
Well I guess and that was the year where

727
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
It became clear that Jeff

728
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Probably

729
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Wasn't the right person to

730
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
Continue as the brewmaster you guys went out

731
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200

00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
What how did that happen

739
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,864
We had sponsored some speakers at the crap

740
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632

To come talk to American craft Brewers About Belgium beers and Belgian styles

743
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,408
And we were having this dinner and Peter was sitting next to me and I thought life

744
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm just going to see how this goes

745
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
So I said to him yeah you know

746
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
We're hiring

747
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,368
For a brewmaster and you know we talked about this and that and

748
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
Left it at that

749
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
And I came back to

750

And

752
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Was working at the brewery

753
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,888
And someone said this guy from Belgium is on the phone for you and I picked up the

754
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
The phone and it was Peter

755
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
He said my wife and I are in

756
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Rhode Island

757
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
And we thought we would come

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
Drive to the brook in Fort Collins

759
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
You know it's a big

760
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
Country

761
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,648
So they drove all the way to Fort Collins

762
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,720
And was anybody really making

763
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
These kinds of beers

764
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
In a 1996 well we were the first

765
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Brewery in the United

766
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
It stays to specialize

767
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Listen belgian-style beers

768
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,008
The first three years that we took our beards

769
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
To the Great American Beer Festival

770
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
They didn't even judge RB

771
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Because they had no category

772
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Race for Belgian

773
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Old Style Beer

774
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
Somebody took them home and had a great time and

775
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,600
But like we got we got these

776
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
The gabf gives you judges taste

777
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
Eating nuts and we got these notes back that we're like yeah we

778
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Waiting

779
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Chase them

780
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
We don't have categories

781
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
So once once Peter becomes

782
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Your brewmaster

783
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,264
I'm sure the Tracy group but like what just in general was he

784
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
Bringing Emily

785
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
Coriander and orange peel and lemon peels and

786
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
What we were already doing that with

787
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
With some of our core beers but

788
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,040
One of the things that I can now see in retrospect

789
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
That just by naming ourselves

790
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
New Belgium Brewing Company

791
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
We gave ourselves

792
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
License

793
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
To do so many

794
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
Things because

795
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
You know we could use fruit

796
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,144
And coriander and crazy East Raines and

797
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
And things that

798
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
We're very new

799
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Go to the America

800
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
2

801
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
The growing

802
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
2000-2001

803
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Jeff

804
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Leaves the company

805
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
You know I'm usually doing so well it was

806
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
A dream of his

807
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Do you know why he left

808
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
I think he

809
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Wanted to do other things

810
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
And

811
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
That sort of day today

812
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,816
Process was less interesting to him

813
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Then that

814
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Kind of

815
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Early designing of

816
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
Should bury the lead but eventually your marriage and

817
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,920
And you still are very civil relationship you've got children that you raised together and

818
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
I guess you just

819
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Even saw him recently

820
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
Was that period of time after he left

821
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Was it easier for you was a

822
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Challenging mean

823
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Well

824
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
To go back to

825
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Peter buchardt

826
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
For a moment

827
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
One of the things I've heard

828
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Peter buchardt

829
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
Say is that I have never seen

830
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,936
One person grow so much

831
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
As you grew

832
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
In that time

833
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
As you grow

834
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Meaning me

835
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,432
I just you know when all the sudden it's all yours

836
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
If there's no ambiguity Are You The Boss are you not the boss who's the Boss

837
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
And I don't think that leaders should discount that you know you're like all we're all equal and it doesn't really matter who

838
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
The boss has no in fact it does matter who the boss is

839
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
And there were a lot of things open book management

840
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,680
Employee ownership

841
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,520
We had wind power in a we were doing a lot of relief

842
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,104
Fun stuff both in beer and in business practice

843
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
And

844
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
I have been

845
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,784
Really transparent and honest and vulnerable

846
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
My co-workers were

847
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Will tell you that I'm a sap and I cry easily I have stood up in front of

848
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,792
Have the men talk about getting a divorce

849
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
If you step in front of your divorce I've stood up in front of them

850
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
Ben said I'm looking at

851
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
How we're going to have this sort of succession planning and turn of the founders liquid

852
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Quiddity wheel Landing

853
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
And here's what I see is the pros and cons and I have tried to really

854
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Make

855
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
Nearly nothing off-limits and I've also I think been really human about it

856
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,144
And I think there are certainly people who might sort of poo poo

857
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
Do that within our organization

858
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
But I think there are a lot more pee

859
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
People who understand that I have tried to be really real

860
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
And human then

861
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,784
Care

862
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
We had done

863
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
We had Jim Cook

864
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
On the show

865
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
But you're not have to go in

866
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
And he said that a certain point as they became bigger

867
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Beer snobs

868
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
Did not want to drink

869
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Get anymore

870
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,912
You're not as big as Sam Adams but you're big and very big

871
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Craft Brewery

872
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,008
Do you also have that

873
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Issue where

874
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
You got

875
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Yeah Fat Tire

876
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
You know they're too big

877
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
New Belgium is too big

878
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,224
Like I'm going to my local totally sure we do

879
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
I mean there is

880
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
We will put our wood age

881
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
In shower beers up against anyone

882
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Yeah we're a bigger Brewery

883
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,512
But we. We do a lot of

884
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,584
You know from the silly to the sublime

885
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
We do a lot of really

886
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Fun interesting things

887
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
And I don't want to be

888
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Count it out

889
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Where that's at

890
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
What what's your annual revenue now

891
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
232

892
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
E-40

893
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,016
We don't generally talk about that publicly but

894
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:16,672
When you get a job I'll be happy to talk to you about it

895
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:23,072
Burlington

896
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
200 to 250

897
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
I like to say quarter

898
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Quarter billion

899
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
Do you remember ever

900
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Ever Getting to a point where you just thought

901
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Started this in

902
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Basement and we're doing 10 million a year now

903
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
20 million a year like

904
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
Do you ever remember thinking

905
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
Thinking that are you just constantly working and just

906
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,096
No I to I totally have pinch me moments even like today

907
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
You know when I walk

908
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:02,496
Where it really hits me is when I walk out of the brewery and I watch all these

909
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
People

910
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
You know sitting in our Beer Garden

911
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,968
Playing Rollie Pollie or or just sitting on the front patio or playing with their kids on the lawn

912
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
I have this feeling like wow

913
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Look at this

914
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
Sting look at this

915
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
Touching people's lives

916
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Through something as great as beer

917
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
I'm still in awe

918
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,376
Pretty early on you guys

919
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Decided that you would

920
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,704
Give

921
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Ownership

922
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,544
Some ownership equity in the company to your employees

923
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
When was there serve

924
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,944
Was there a specific idea behind that did you think that's how we're going to attract good

925
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
People

926
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Or

927
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,320
Or was there another reason why you decide to do that

928
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,160
The early days of New Belgium

929
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
It took all of us to work really hard and I really felt

930
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
This deep

931
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,680
Sense of wanting to acknowledge

932
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
That my co-workers were you know those were 14 16 hour days you can

933
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
Bottle a half a batch of beer

934
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:18,528
And they will pick that up tomorrow it's a live food product and you have to finish

935
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,368
If the machine breaks down

936
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,512
6 times or 20 times in between the beginning of the end you stay and you finish it

937
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
And it was important to me we had talked to people who were experts who said well you know it

938
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,008
What's really customary to give management ownership

939
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
But you really don't want to give him a forklift driver that's what your accounts were telling you or advisors

940
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
And I said no I am really want to give the forklift driver owner

941
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Ownership because to me we were building this community we were all in this together

942
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
So we started off with a Phantom stock plan every 6 months we would

943
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:11,008
Allocate shares Pro rata to our co-workers and we would make them stand up in front of

944
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,152
All of the current owners seems bizarre now but and

945
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
And like speak to us about why they wanted to be an odor then convinced and we'd ask some question.

946
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,696
Chestnut just f---ing me but all of the owners so how long are you going to be here and

947
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
What kind of skill are you going to work on in the next six months and those kinds of things

948
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
And then

949
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
Eventually you decided to

950
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,056
Sell your entire stake to your employer you do not own any of New Belgium

951
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Today right

952
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,872
Except as

953
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,152
An ESOP

954
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
Account holder within the ESOP Trust

955
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,552
Just as my other coworkers are I own

956
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
That portion

957
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
But other than that no

958
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
So a hundred

959
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Percent of the company

960
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
Basically became an employee-owned company

961
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
What

962
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
Wishing

963
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
I wanted to see how do we

964
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Test

965
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
This

966
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
Model

967
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Where

968
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
People in America get

969
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,760
Own something where they build value

970
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
They're all in it together to

971
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Do this thing

972
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
And it's this engine and you add love

973
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
And you had beer

974
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,048
Beer is great

975
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
And it's this engine that builds this palpable I mean I've had thousands of people say

976
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,080
I came to New Belgium for a tour and you can just tell

977
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
But these people are into it they they like

978
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
This thing

979
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
We spend a lot of time at this thing called work and it should feel

980
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
You good

981
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
It's I think it does that saying you are one of the few women leaders in the beer industry

982
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
What was it

983
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Was it ever difficult that you ever faced

984
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,783
I mean you must have spent so many years going to conferences and trade

985
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,087
Meetings and you're one of the few

986
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Few women

987
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,279
So I was and we had to trade associations for smaller Brewers

988
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
In the United

989
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Midstates

990
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,143
And I was the only person that was on both

991
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Bored

992
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,751
Any only one woman so like one woman on

993
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
To board so that's

994
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
30 men

995
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
One woman

996
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Keyboards

997
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
Most craft Brewers are really

998
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
More enlightened

999
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
On the spectrum of

1000
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
That kind of

1001
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,599
Some of the things we read these days

1002
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,135
Your kind of jaw-dropping

1003
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Honestly

1004
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
But I do think

1005
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
That gender bias

1006
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
Is subtle in Purvis

1007
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,143
And I think people who I love dearly

1008
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Sometimes

1009
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,287
Just don't really even realize you no friends of mine in the industry

1010
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Occasionally I will think like

1011
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Wow

1012
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Did you just

1013
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Ask Dad or

1014
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Or

1015
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,783
Mansplain right over the top of me your

1016
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
And

1017
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,671
I'm pretty opinionated and strong so I can hold my own

1018
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
But

1019
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,791
You kind of have to be opinionated and strong and hold your own

1020
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
How much of

1021
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
What has happened to you in this

1022
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Success

1023
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Of

1024
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Your company and your own success

1025
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
Do you think it's because of your skill and intelligence and how much

1026
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
Because of just

1027
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Lock

1028
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Yes

1029
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:07,039
You know I think it is a combination of

1030
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Of those things

1031
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,903
And you know there's that sort of old saw about luck is

1032
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,207
How hard you work and timing

1033
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,559
You know we worked really hard

1034
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:23,167
We didn't say oh you know let's all take a week off and

1035
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
If if there I like to win

1036
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,079
If there is a competitive advantage to be had

1037
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:35,455
We're likely to push to try to Prevail in that way

1038
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
So it was all those things

1039
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
That was simple stuff it was hard work

1040
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
It was timing

1041
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
That tire was a great name for a beer

1042
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
So it's all that stuff

1043
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Put together

1044
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Tim Jordan

1045
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815

408 in addition to that employee ownership plan

1052
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623

00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
Pretty cool perks for twerk

1056
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
And after 5 years of the company
