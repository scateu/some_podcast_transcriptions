And thanks

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
We found after getting it into the stores that we hadn't really thought this through carefully enough

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
It wasn't an effective deodorant so we did a product recall

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
What what percentage of your business did the owner account for that time

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
Enormous amount of product that you couldn't sell $450,000

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,280
From NPR how I built this

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movements they built

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Turn to $5,000 loan into a soap and toothpaste business

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,088
Call Tom's of Maine now one of the biggest brands in the natural products

26
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
So if you put a previous episode of the show with

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
John Mackey the guy who founded Whole Foods

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Explain how

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
When you started that company in the late 1970s

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
Natural and organic foods were

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Are the counterculture

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
The kind of store is that

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Sold organic foods and soaps

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Also sold

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Crystals and New Age pamphlets and

36
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Wind chime

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,344
It's not like there's anything wrong with those things it's just that now

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Organic

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Is gone mainstream

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,976
It's big business a multi-billion-dollar industry

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
But chasing money isn't

42
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Terminal Warehouse

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Maine

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,264
Start making the stuff because they were part of a movement

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
The movement that took off

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
L86

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Season early 70

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
People who were worried about toxic

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Shenzhen artificial ingredients

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Things we use everyday

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
But unlike Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield

52
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Jerry's or

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Gary hirshberg of Stonyfield

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Also been on the show

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,768
Tom Chappell wasn't and isn't a lefty countercultural type of guy

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
He's actually an old school New England Yankee

57
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
His dad ran a

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
Textile mill and he grew up in

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
Traditional family

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Quiet

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Stoic

62
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Episcopal Republic

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
And literally yes I mean literally

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
His life

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Was a Norman Rockwell painting

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
That's right

67
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm not perfect Norman Rockwell found me

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,624
Add a choir practice in Pittsfield Massachusetts St Stephen's church

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Pulled me out and asked if

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
I want to be on the cover of the Saturday evening post and I was 10 years old I had never heard of the Saturday evening post

71
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Never heard of Norman Rockwell

72
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,192
So I just looked at him and I said I don't know I'll have to call my mother and see

73
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
And so Tom did call his mother and he

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
Did actually end up on the cover of the Saturday evening post

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
In the spring of 1950

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
54

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
Time eventually went to Trinity College in Hartford where he studied English

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
He met his wife Kate and they got married when he was 22

79
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
And then

80
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
He got his first job working for Aetna

81
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
Selling insurance and he was a great sales

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
It didn't last too long

83
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Well I was the number one

84
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Salesman

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Class of 65 people

86
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
But

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
I was been given my raise

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Are the Rays

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
Was a $600

90
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
I found out the lowest raise

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
$300

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
You were making you even a $600 raise

93
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
As for being the number one sales rep

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Meet worst

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Sales rep $300

96
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Correct

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
That didn't compute

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
The truth

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
For me was that working in a large corporate

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Structure

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,471
Was something I could see required a great deal of order discipline get in line wait

102
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
And I

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
Realize that I was not made for

104
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
That kind of a culture

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Competitive did you want to be the top selling insurance agent in that office was that important

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
I think it's always been important to me

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
I've had people

108
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Say to me

109
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
About their work I've never aspired to

110
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Be the boss

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Fix myself

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Good Lord

113
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
I can't imagine that

114
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,543
Foster. Least one or two steps down so that they don't have the responsibility

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
But

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
I love computer

117
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
I see nothing wrong with

118
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
It motivates me

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
It motivates my team

120
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
So sure

121
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Puppet still hate sounds like

122
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Pretty quickly you realize that you

123
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Didn't want to like climb the corporate ladder it at that

124
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
That you just it just wasn't what you wanted for your life

125
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
I mean

126
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
I saw my life is

127
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Being

128
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
Full of possibilities I certainly had the

129
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
Intellectual wherewithal to

130
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Question whether or not

131
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
A refined life

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Corporate America

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
What's going to make me happy

134
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
And I decided that it was not

135
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
And I went in to tell my boss

136
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
And he said well maybe we should get you a a psychologist to talk to before you take this

137
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Position

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
So you usually laugh and you and Kate move to

139
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Region

140
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,639
A nemesis like 6868 April of 68

141
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
The first your plan was to work with your dad in like a new business

142
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
That he had started

143
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
I work for

144
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,671
Couple of years with him and then what was he doing

145
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,303
She had been in the textile business in Massachusetts and

146
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
Like all of the businesses in Uxbridge Massachusetts they all failed

147
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
And so he had to reboot restart his life

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
He did it with

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,919
His new business which was pollution abatement for

150
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
Textiles Industries in Maine and he was inventing

151
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Things that could do the job without nitrates

152
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
And phosphates which was a

153
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
A new ID

154
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
And what was it about

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Is business that

156
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
I don't know

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Interesting

158
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Well I was

159
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
Doing this for me it was

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
It's about

161
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Combining business

162
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
The

163
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
In the mid-sixties you didn't

164
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Work for a business

165
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:18,783
And be concerned about the environment it was either or you work for a nonprofit on behalf of the environment

166
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Are you working

167
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
I knew that you could integrate the two

168
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
And so what that that makes you start to think about

169
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Your aunt like starting your own company and and

170
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Whether you

171
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
You could do with Easter

172
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Things to yes

173
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,911
And and as of course we're going to learn you went into the

174
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Cleaning products

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Business

176
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
As well as personal products

177
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Like soaps and and shampoo is right

178
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Yes

179
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
So I I was

180
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Certainly familiar with

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
The

182
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Nuts and Bolts

183
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
The chemistry of cleaning

184
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
So the idea of

185
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
Cleaning the body with soaps and so forth

186
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,255
With ingredients that were not harmful to the environment and I certainly had

187
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
My fathers

188
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Example and the thing

189
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
About business that I love so much that it wasn't

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Business that was

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
In itself

192
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,359
It was the agents that ran the business

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
The could be

194
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Sinister

195
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
One just needed to use the tools of free enterprise in a way that was more ethically

196
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Instruct

197
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
To society as well as to

198
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
All those that are taking the risk

199
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
I did use the money to

200
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Even start

201
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
The company

202
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Well I didn't

203
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
I asked a friend to put up

204
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
$5,000

205
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
He and his wife were involved in the creation of this

206
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
New alternative school in Kennebunk call the school around us

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
We became good friends

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
And I told them of my idea

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,111
He had some IBM stock and took it to the bank as collateral to

210
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Loan me $5,000

211
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
And that's what

212
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Company was

213
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Started on and obviously that didn't last very long

214
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,655
He put another 2500 and then after that it was the second mortgage on the home and

215
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,495
Then the SBA Loans and so on and so forth

216
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
You know it's early years maybe it's just you and Kate like making this stuff making the soap and and the

217
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
The shampoos or did you like he's presently the higher

218
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
People to help you out

219
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
What Kate was actually very much involved in

220
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Raising the three children that we had a

221
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
She was

222
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Probably our best

223
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Consumer Advocate within the system

224
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,423
The help guide my thinking on product design and packaging and so forth and she's an artist

225
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
So she helped

226
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
With the graphics on the ark

227
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Otherwise

228
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
I hired a chemist

229
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Who

230
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
For us he was brilliant

231
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
He helped us with product formulations that were

232
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
Authentically grounded in natural ingredients

233
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
We had a

234
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Warehouse

235
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
In Kennebunk

236
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
We bought used stainless steel

237
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Dairy equipment

238
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Around the neighborhood

239
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
I knew where to get ahold of stainless steel equipment for

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,703
A hundred bucks here in a hundred bucks they are and

241
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
Then you get your your first filling machine and

242
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Song you just go

243
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
So all this equipment was actually

244
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Design for the dairy industry we were using some

245
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Soap and shampoo

246
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Yes

247
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Where other

248
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
People making

249
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,135
This type of stuff in the mid-70s where there was a lot of competition with their natural up

250
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Companies making

251
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Soaps and shampoos and toupee

252
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
Not really we did have

253
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
Pioneer named dr. Bronner from Chicago

254
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
Was making his peppermint oil soap

255
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,359
But other than that there was a shampoo made a call or Jean shampoo on Long Island

256
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
But after that no

257
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,735
If we were the first person to put a toothpaste together

258
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
A deodorant together a mouthwash

259
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
All of that was

260
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
We were first time

261
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Providers of

262
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
What was what was in

263
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
In the toothpaste what was the formula

264
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Rowlett

265
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
But of course

266
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Wonderful question is God

267
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
The calcium carbonate

268
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
What is a natural

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,543
Mineral that is a mild abrasive to do the cleaning of the teeth leave got to

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,175
A humectant is glycerin that is a byproduct of a natural soap making process

271
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
But I had a chemist

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
That helped me with all that I could only talk

273
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
About the ideal I would give him my sense of the ideal and he would try to turn the

274
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Not ideal into a

275
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
And efficacious

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Formula

277
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,679
It seems like when you launch the toothpaste in the mid-70s that's really when the company

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,311
Started to take off were you surprised it was toothpaste for did you anticipate that happening

279
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
I had a hunch that it would be successful because there was no natural toothpaste people didn't know what or not

280
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Toothpaste was

281
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
And I felt that the motivation for my

282
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Customer

283
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Was to avoid a tattoo

284
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
But

285
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Yes the Turning Point came

286
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Within launch of the tooth

287
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Did anybody say to you

288
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
Thinking making toothpaste everyone uses Colgate and Crest like

289
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Why are you even wasting your time

290
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
We have plenty of people

291
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,967
Advising me that it was a crazy idea to compete with Procter & Gamble and coffee

292
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,807
Yeah but I mean lately have point right of me why would you even

293
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Get into a market that was

294
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Totally dominated by

295
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Well I think that comes

296
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
Purely and simply down to who you're serving and in our case we

297
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
I knew very well that we were serving a

298
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Consumer that was

299
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Discerning about what they would put

300
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
In their bodies and why

301
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
They wanted facts

302
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Knowledge

303
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
We thought well why not service

304
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
This is a great idea

305
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
The more people

306
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Learned

307
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
About what was in their shampoo or their soap for the toothpaste

308
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
They would question

309
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Ralph Nader

310
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
In the mid-70s

311
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Was successful in

312
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Facilitating

313
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Legislation that

314
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,983
Required that ingredients in personal care products had to be on the label once that happened

315
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
That disclosure

316
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
And transparency

317
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Raise Lots

318
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
2 questions in people's minds for the first time

319
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
Cuz it's all these things they they couldn't pronounce on the lake

320
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Couldn't pronounce

321
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
And so are our package are toothpaste box

322
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,207
Like any toothpaste box has four sides and one side was committed to the brand

323
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Name and the other three sides were committed to information

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,143
And we did have a moment of courage in all of this wind

325
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
The federal government said

326
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,007
That any kind of fluoride toothpaste would have to

327
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,847
I'll be registered as having tested off successfully forever

328
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
Sea and safety on rats and we so we don't subject animals to

329
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Studies

330
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
Reviews human trials and I said well the protocol is

331
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Is rat studies

332
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
And by testing on rats is only taking the rats and brushing their teeth

333
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Is anyone just have a nice shiny tea

334
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Lyca text

335
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Quite cruel

336
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
Yeah I mean you've got to do is cruel

337
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Does this know pretty well

338
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
And so we refused

339
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
We went to Washington and

340
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,359
Met with the FDA and said we've got human trials and they

341
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,991
Eventually a seated and then we went on to get the American Dental Association seal of acceptance

342
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
As well

343
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,879
So we we kept to our values and

344
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
The change happened after that all the other companies

345
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
Stop testing on animals

346
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
We had a big influence

347
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
What was the the culture of

348
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Times like these

349
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Because you know

350
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
We know that Ben and Jerry

351
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
Apologetically liberal place

352
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
And very sore

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Hippies and

354
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
What was the culture like

355
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
It was it was it similar to those other companies

356
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
I don't think so I think we were

357
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,927
More straitlaced and the reason I say that is I wasn't an activist I wasn't a hippie

358
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
I wanted to appeal

359
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
On the merits of the product

360
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
Assume at the same time as the beginning

361
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,471
The people buying your toothpaste in Ann Arbor Michigan or San Francisco or not

362
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Organelle

363
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Country Club Republicans

364
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
The Disney Store

365
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Countercultural

366
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
People buying

367
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
At least the beginning

368
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
Well that's absolutely true and and mind you

369
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:54,111
We were countercultural to we just didn't look the part and play the part

370
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
I don't think

371
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,255
You would have found me in Berkeley you wouldn't have found me in Cambridge

372
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Demonstrating

373
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
But I had the same indignation deep down inside about the way the country was being run

374
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
I just had a different way of handling it

375
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Did you did you have

376
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,663
Massive Ambitions your company by the time you reach profitability in the mid-70s

377
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Launch of toothpaste

378
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Were you thinking yourself

379
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Discovery Cube

380
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
This is going to be

381
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Massive

382
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
And that's that's what I want

383
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,719
No I didn't think that I don't think I had the self-confidence

384
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
To think that

385
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
I think

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
My

387
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,703
Was to bring it to a certain sales level and to stay within the natural food community

388
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Because within the

389
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
The natural food store Community or distribution system

390
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
We were the Procter & Gamble of that class

391
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Trade

392
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Winnetka

393
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Particular Opera

394
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
Opportunities started to wane

395
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
In terms of growth rate

396
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Then we looked at the traditional

397
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Supermarkets in chain drug stores

398
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
What's the question what would

399
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
It'd be like

400
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
For us to be on those shelves

401
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
How to expand into the traditional Market

402
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Time you did not mean

403
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
You study English

404
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Go to business school and I gather it

405
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
In the early eighties

406
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
You brought on a bunch of

407
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
From Harvard

408
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
NBA's

409
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
And other people with the

410
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
The credentials

411
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Bring them in to execute that strategy to two

412
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Rotom's Main

413
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
You said into

414
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
You have to bring into more traditional Market

415
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Totally

416
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,791
I had a fellow join the company as a director named John Rockwell

417
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Who from Booz Allen in New York

418
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Became a great mentor to me

419
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,215
And I remember his saying we've got to help

420
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Transition this company from

421
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Serving

422
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
The health committed

423
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
2 expanding it

424
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
To the people that are Health concern

425
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
So if we were going to go into

426
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
Supermarkets in drugstores

427
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
That was going to be a different

428
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Business proposition

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,791
We brought on people from Bruce Allen Hamilton McKinsey & Company

430
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,911
And so from 1981 to 1986 we were X

431
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Shooting a strategic

432
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Plan that

433
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Had a lot

434
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
To do with

435
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
Changing your message so that you could

436
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Appealed

437
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
New consumer

438
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Finding the right

439
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
People

440
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
2

441
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
Help on the team to build the team

442
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,159
In our case we needed to

443
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Increase our prices

444
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,023
Figure out ways to make the product

445
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
More efficient

446
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
I guess and I guess the strategy was working because

447
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,495
It was in the early eighties word when you guys really started to explode and growth like

448
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
25%

449
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Year over year

450
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
And then in 1986

451
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
You have this kind of

452
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Personal

453
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Prices

454
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
I guess you should have

455
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
Something is going on and you just

456
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Feel like

457
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
There's an emptiness what

458
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
What was that about what's going on

459
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
The crisis was that we had achieved

460
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Our

461
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Strategic benchmarks

462
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
And I was feeling quite empty because we hadn't created a new product

463
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
4 years

464
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
And I said I just don't

465
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Feel the meaning

466
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
Of this Enterprise in just improving the business in terms of size and profit

467
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Ability

468
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
We were not

469
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Creating

470
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
New products

471
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
And making a difference in areas that I thought

472
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,767
You should because we had become overcome with the numbers

473
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,095
Leadership had become

474
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
You know the NBA

475
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
It sounds to me like you will just

476
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
You weren't

477
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
In just a moment

1986

502
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Chapel is the CEO of a

Very successful company

504

Leprechaun

507

He was feeling like

508
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,968
He had strayed from why he founded the company in the first place

509
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
And he was looking for the kind of answers

510
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
You don't find it

511
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Harvard Business School

Emerald part-time

514

At Harvard Divinity School

515
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,792
I got up at four 4:30 in the morning to study

516
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
I work very hard it was extremely difficult

517
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Educational

518
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:03,008
Experience with some motivating because I was learning

519
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Things from

520
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
Philosophers like Martin buber

521
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,200
Who had some fantastic things to offer in his book

522
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
I am down

523
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
I would say to myself wow

524
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Why don't more people know this stuff this is important

525
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
It didn't it wasn't just

526
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,280
Martin buber it was Jonathan Edwards

527
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,120
The whole bunch of 19th 20th century philosophers

528
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,520
This is like super admirable a question about eccentric

529
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
You just save your fears your staff like

530
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,736
I'm going to Harvard Divinity School and everyone was like

531
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
That's right

532
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Obviously the benefit of

533
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,904
Having your own company in the company

534
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
An attitude that

535
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,280
Experian start to change. What you operate

536
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
Is the owner and CEO of a

537
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Rodger company

538
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Well it would change

539
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
My life first

540
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,264
Bald because I was getting answers to questions

541
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
In the readings

542
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
East philosophers that

543
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Weir solutions for me

544
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
It gave me

545
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
A spiritual

546
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Orientation

547
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
And

548
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,320
I actually began to see a new reality

549
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
There is a

550
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Force of goodness

551
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
That is available to

552
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Anyone of us

553
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Call it what

554
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Ever you want to call it

555
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Force of goodness

556
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
Becomes a medium by which we begin to do work differ

557
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
Play together one of respect and mutuality collaboratively

558
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,568
Towards ends that have more constructive value

559
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Then just for the sake

560
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Of

561
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Piling up a lot of profit

562
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
I think Harvard Divinity School gave me the

563
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Knowledge

564
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
I was able to return to

565
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
Tom's of Maine on a full-time basis and say

566
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
Here are the things that we're going to do now that are in the name of

567
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
Goodness and performance

568
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,144
So it is an example of a mean you push this idea of of 5

569
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Percent of your time for

570
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Who work for the company

571
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Take 5%

572
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Have your time and just

573
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Do some charity work

574
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
Yeah but we would organize that charity work

575
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
Or they would elect to do what they wanted to do in the community that might be

576
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Literacy work

577
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
It could be helping on the Appalachian Trail

578
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
It was generally

579
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,464
Community-based environmental based

580
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,048
Needs then they loved it I mean they would come back to work

581
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
Excited about what we've been able to do for their community

582
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
I guess it was one of the

583
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Big crisis

584
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
Tom's of Maine happened

585
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
In 92 with the

586
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Wizard

587
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
It it it took you like a few years to get back

588
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Profitability app

589
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,392
That what what happened what was the prices

590
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
The crisis is we were

591
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
While trying to

592
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
Find a

593
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Source of

594
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Humectant

595
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,424
And because we were all about natural and

596
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Renewable materials

597
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
We did not want to use petroleum-based ingredients

598
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
So

599
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
We thought that we had found a substitute in

600
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
Coconut derived glycerin

601
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
And we reformulated the deodorant using

602
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
That as the human

603
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Rather than

604
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Petroleum-derived

605
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
And we found after getting it into the stores that we hadn't really thought this through care

606
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Carefully enough

607
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
It wasn't an effective

608
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Deodorant

609
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
What was the problem

610
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Didn't smell good or that

611
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Last long enough for me

612
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
It did not last

613
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,272
It was clear that we had made a mistake we had a responsibility to call that product back

614
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,368
And to figure out what to do in the meantime so

615
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
We did a product recall

616
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
What what what percentage of your business did the owner account for

617
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
22%

618
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,400
Enormous amount of product that you you couldn't sell

619
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:20,544
$450,000 worth

620
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Yes it is a company

621
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:28,992
It created a loss for that operating year and we are able to recover the next year

622
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
But certainly I don't mean to suggest

623
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:37,184
That it wasn't disruptive it was extremely disruptive and difficult but we weathered through it

624
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
Would I have been fired in another setting I don't know

625
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Probably

626
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Did you fire anybody

627
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
Did somebody take take the hit for that

628
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
No I I think I took the hit for that

629
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:56,128
No we didn't fire anybody

630
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
Okay let's let's fast forward a few years

631
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
2006

632
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
Your 62

633
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
You and Kate have

634
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Bill Tom's of Maine

635
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
From nothing

636
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Well you're the boss

637
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
And then you

638
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Sold almost

639
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
All of the company

640
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Colgate

641
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
4

642
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Reporter for about hundred million.

643
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
And I guess you know what

644
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,752
I would expect that you would retire and just kind of like

645
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Enjoy life

646
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Your grandkids

647
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Is that

648
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Is that what you wanted to do

649
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Well I've spent time

650
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:34,272
Thinking about what I was going to do with the next part of my life and one of my mentors in New York

651
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Tefillin and Sean Whitehead

652
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
He said you're young man you have plenty of time

653
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,464
This is not the time for you to retire

654
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
I didn't feel like

655
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Retiring

656
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,840
I felt I had a lot of energy I had a lot

657
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,216
Desire to do something and I wanted to once again

658
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
Create impact

659
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:00,896
Yeah but I also understood that the reason I was successful at Tom's of Maine is because I took market share away

660
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Colgate

661
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
Procter & Gamble and unit

662
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
So when you can

663
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
Take market share away from the kamado

664
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Buy an alternative approach

665
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
Struvite product development of that product and service

666
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
That's what I'm good at

667
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Okcu

668
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
SAU

669
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
You wound up taking those those ideas in the

670
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Scales and

671
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
And turning into another business

672
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
That's right exactly

673
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,848
I thought about it a business that could once again

674
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Benefit from

675
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
A change in the way it operated

676
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
Operating with the principles of sustainability which have been so important to me at Tom's of Maine

677
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
And that's what I decided to do in the textile and the Garment industry because it is the second largest

678
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
Polluter on this Earth

679
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
Exploits

680
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Sewing and seamstresses around the world

681
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
So we set out to figure out

682
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
What we could do

683
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,520
Obey an american-based a product I equal

684
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
So we make

685
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Coats we make

686
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Shirts we make

687
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Pants

688
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
Polo shirts everything

689
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
We should declare for this company called Ramblers way

690
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Correct

691
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
It is an exciting

692
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Exciting

693
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
How important is it

694
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
For you that

695
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
This company

696
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,560
Becomes profitable like Tom's of Maine how important is it

697
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Set for you

698
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
That this company really does

699
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,264
Takeaway Market Remington and how hungry are you and you've proven yourself you started the company you made lots of money everybody

700
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
You know Tom's of Maine

701
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
You have nothing to prove in the business world

702
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
How hungry are you what's the answer

703
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
For me

704
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:43,040
It's important to demonstrate that this is a different business model

705
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
In which you are using boobers concept

706
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
Is that the mind is twofold

707
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
That you can on the one hand

708
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Consider the goodness

709
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,864
Inherent worthiness of something

710
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
And on the other hand

711
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
The utility

712
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,104
And as long as greed and domination what are the motivations and that's where we got into our trouble

713
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
That's my life

714
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Legacy

715
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
That this is something that needs to be taken up by Business Schools and larger corporations

716
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Understand

717
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,696
That there are vulnerable as long as they operate with a

718
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
Sole principle of maximizing profitability

719
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
If rainbows whenever

720
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
No that's not fine

721
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
I'm a businessman

722
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,872
How to be a businessman profitability is

723
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
Part of the

724
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Responsibility

725
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
To yourself and to others

726
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
I'm curious how did you how are you able to

727
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
To sort of

728
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Reconcile your

729
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Deep philosophical

730
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
Connection to your face and then

731
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Easier spend studying

732
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,584
Philosophy and really thinking about the world a different way

733
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
With the fact that

734
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
That you were actually at least on paper

735
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
The money was becoming

736
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
A part of your life

737
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Well I never

738
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
Considered myself becoming rich

739
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,456
Let me explain that I read a book called The Gift

740
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
And it's really about

741
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
How to use money

742
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
And the purpose of money is to keep it in circulation

743
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
Not to Stow it away

744
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
And so we certainly traveled

745
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,912
And we were able to buy properties that we otherwise would not have

746
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
But aside from

747
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
That

748
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
I needed to find something constructive

749
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
To do and to use my money

750
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Listen to I asked everybody to come to the show

751
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,760
When can you look back at Tom's of Maine and

752
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Your

753
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
Career & Ramblers way in Antioch

754
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
What happened to you is be

755
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Because of

756
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,720
Your business Acumen and your intelligence and how much it was

757
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Was it because

758
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Well I think

759
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
Having forces come together

760
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
In a Serendipity way

761
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
Is indeed an important part of

762
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
The process

763
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Buttom

764
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,848
I think it's both you can't you can't do it without skill

765
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
But I do think you

766
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,224
For me because I live in the spiritual world it's not luck

767
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Kids

768
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
The work of of Grace

769
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
Paying attention to what I'm doing

770
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Nourishing

771
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,328
Do you get any residuals from that Norman Rockwell painting in them

772
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
I got a call from the family

773
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,776
Though this was probably 10 years ago saying that the painting had been in the

774
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
They're home in Milan for years

775
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,736
Children inheriting at the decided to put it on the market

776
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Sotheby's

777
00:32:54,272 --> 00:33:00,416
So they said it's been valued at $750,000 and they wanted me to have the first chance to buy

778
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
You did right because no problem I went home and told Kate and she said well

779
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
We have to give it to a museum we wouldn't want that in the house

780
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
So I'm afraid I if I had to pass off

781
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Tom Chappell

782
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152

800
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

801
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Time now for how you

802
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
You built that

803
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
And say we have an update for you

804
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
When we first met Paul kaster a year ago

805
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
He was a high school senior

806
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Launching a

807
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
A business that

808
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
It makes

809
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
Wooden bow ties which car

810
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Kind of a thing

811
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
The wooden bow tie is just like a pre-tied fabric bow tie

812
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
Except for what is made out of wood

813
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
It's a common gift if you're woodworker and you're a preppy guy in high

814
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,576
But as a woodworker I kind of saw all the flaws in the design

815
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,440
Topol decided you know I can make a better wooden bow tie one that actually looks

816
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,256
Less flat and more like real fabric

817
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
Soapy set up a shop in his basement at almond

818
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
And he started selling the ties on Etsy

819
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
The greatest compliment that I ever get is

820
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
I didn't know that was a wooden bow tie

821
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
And I got that one

822
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Paul has an entire line of bow ties

823
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,944
How to get wood from all over the world

824
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
Maple

825
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Cherry

826
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
Walnut

827
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Co-op

828
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Cocobolo

829
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Zebra wood

830
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,416
What is 1

831
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Infosys

832
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Business was

833
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
Pretty good email about 20 thousand bucks

834
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Action profit

835
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
Annie's doing about the same amount

836
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
This year

837
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,216
We're still selling online all over the world and actually it's run out of my mom's sewing room

838
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,104
Break so Paul has his mom fulfilling all the orders out of their home in Kansas City because

839
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,456
He isn't even there anymore he's in California as a freshman in college

840
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
A few months ago he actually started a spin-off business

841
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
I was at USC for orientation

842
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,232
And I met a guy in Ostrander shipcenter here and he is an idea machine

843
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
And so he came to me and you like Paul

844
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
I have like a thousand other things

845
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
Testing you can make bow ties out of

846
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
And one of the things

847
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
This guy talked about was carbon fiber

848
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
That's Tuff

849
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Lightweight

850
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,336
Woven material that they use in things like race cars and Rockets

851
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
He said

852
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
There's this company that takes

853
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,248
The carbon fiber from the aerospace companies here in California

854
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
Andre makes it into carbon fiber skateboards

855
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,416
And he said I should link you up and you guys should make a Carbon Fiber bow tie

856
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,024
DePaul went to check it out and it was also a startup run as it happens

857
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
Buy a recent us CLI

858
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,656
The two of them working on a prototype and why

859
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,544
Carbon fiber boat I was born the wooden bow ties are very classic look

860
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
And the Carbon Fiber bow ties are space-age look

861
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,408
And so I think there's a certain

862
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Wonder

863
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,344
In getting something that you can wear made of the same material that these incredible Rockets are made out of

864
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
Calling his new bowtie brand

865
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672

866
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328

867
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Christmas

868
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
And he is of course doing a lot of this

869
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
Erebus dorm room it was actually I was up last night at 1 a.m. and my room is like toilet you need to go to sleep or start setting for 5
