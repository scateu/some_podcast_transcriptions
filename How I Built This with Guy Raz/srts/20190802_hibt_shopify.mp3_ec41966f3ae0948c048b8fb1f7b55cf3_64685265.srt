I'd not good I mean my team was very very patient with me

53
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
That was a lot to learn

54
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728

00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568

2018

And you might remember this

65
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
Kylie Jenner made the cover of Forbes

66
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
The issue was dedicated to

67
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Female billionaires

68
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,720
And Kylie Jenner made her Fortune from a Cosmetics Empire called

69
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Kylie cosmetics

70
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
I started to read the article I was struck by a few things in particular

71
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,704
Things that just weren't possible even 5 years ago

72
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
For starters Kylie's

73
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Billion dollar company

74
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Employees just seven full-time people

75
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
All of the products

76
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Eggs are manufactured in

77
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,528
Send package by a private label Cosmetics producer in Oxnard California

78
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Kylie's PR marketing team is her iPhone

79
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,464
From which you can reach 140 million Instagram followers

80
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
This is a thing that really blew me away

81
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
All the sales

82
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Fulfillment

83
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
This is handled in

84
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Hayirli by a software platform

85
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Call Shopify

86
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Why does all the stuff behind the scene

87
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Make e-commerce work

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,712
When you click add to cart or buy make sure the transaction will happen seamlessly

89
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,040
You bought something online outside of Amazon or Ebay

90
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,392
There's a pretty good chance you bought it from a store powered by Shopify

91
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,720
It is now used by more than 800 thousand

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
E-commerce companies around the world

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Within two years

94
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Online sales will account for 13% of all retail transactions in the US

95
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
You can imagine this is a big business

96
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Last year alone

97
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Shopify processed more than 40 billion dollars

98
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Salesforce customers

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Company went public in 2015 and shopify's market cap is now just below General

100
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
And yet unless you're in tag or have an online shop there's a chance you have never heard of Shopify

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Which

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,167
In a way it's the personality of the company's co-founder and CEO Toby Luka

103
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
He's the kind of guy who literally rode his bike to vcp

104
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
And even as recently as five years ago at a time Shopify had already raised well over a hundred

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Million dollars in Venture Capital funding

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Toby was still living in a

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Spare room at his in-laws house

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
To save money

109
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Before all that

110
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Toby grew up in koblenz

111
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
In Germany

112
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
And as a kid it was

113
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Preclude

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Toby was bright but

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
He also struggled with learning

116
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,263
I mean I go Darkness positive learning disabilities and

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
Stay hot for me too

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Perform well in the test

119
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Sen salon

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Anthem

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
I don't think I ended up getting a full diagnosis of fat but no

122
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,695
Dyslexic so you know just reading was hard

123
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
It was always a big question about what exactly was going on the Paisley I was bored

124
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Back pain

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
The way the curriculum in Germany was Toddlers really basically he is always solution to my

126
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
Find useful later in life if they have a little time spent talking about a particular problem set fit both solutions would have

127
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,783
If I don't understand the problem I'm trying to solve it say hot for me to

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
Turn on a solution to a problem

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,047
So every finish the 10th grade tell me realize that school wasn't the right fit

130
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
So he left

131
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,447
Enjoy the German apprenticeship program to learn how to become a software engineer

132
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
And yes I'm starting as an apprentice on a small team at a subsidiary of the German manufacturing giant semen

133
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
I found this one team matches

134
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Seem really fun

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
Basement has run by this wonderful Guy Star

136
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
Lexington tastic engineer

137
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Prokarma

138
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
And he would always come on this like BMW motorcycle to work and we would have long hair and he was not

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Being a suit like you were supposed to

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
And so it's like total crap

141
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
So good

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
No one could complain

143
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
You know I just like me to grab potato to him and his little

144
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Group of rabbits

145
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,991
Better Brooklyn really interesting things have often prototyping new things for customers and so on

146
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Until I wanted to be part of a group

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
And so

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,439
Starting roof 16 or 17 and year 2 of my apprenticeship I started getting paid

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
To program all day and that's all I did and he loved it

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
I loved it and I still love it as computer program

151
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
You can do you can forget all

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Time around you you just can

153
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Like I can turn everything off

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
If I'm Pokemon Ninja

155
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543

157
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663

158
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
Right you are snowboarder

159
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Did you grow up snowboarding did you just

160
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
It comes out on your own

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
I mean my parents had a place in the

162
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391

Randy skeete

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
Fast forward a little bit

166
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Took some friends

167
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Spitalfields

168
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Mexican donut was so low that you decide to go to

173
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Can't wait to Catawissa

174
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
It's like 2000

175
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Business around 2

176
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
Anthem

177
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
So this was the first time I said okay

178
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
I'm just going to snowboard I'm not going to take skis like this

179
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Leticia spent all of our time there

180
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
That's really when I fell in love

181
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695

Exactly I'm babysitting contact afterwards and

187
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639

I need to go back and some of us has program in Ottawa and she asked me if I want to come in

198
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,135
Because you could take what you know and do it anywhere

199
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
Where is my event is because

200
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
I grew up on American Media like everything Quin a word came from United States

Email contact

210
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
What was the startup

211
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
It was an attempt at writing a different browser

212
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
But it's

213
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,223
I basically ran out the clock it was everyone benvenue if I wasn't going to do anything at that people best time to leave

214
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
We're talking like a raft of a.com

215
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
What's your 2223

216

219
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
Hey boss

220
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
I would be lying if I said I wasn't

00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
I knew I had

222
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Bebible

Pascal's I could always do more of a thing that I was doing recently or Western persimmons

224
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
I was just hoping I could have been

225
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
Read an indent in somewhere work4bk

226
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Company yeah why

227
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
They look for Siemens Houston

228
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,719
Probably the most important things I've ever done in my life because they can't talk

229
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Don't want

230
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
It was

231
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
In so many ways

232
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Estranged

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Company culture

234
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
In the wave at

235
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
If had exceptionally mistrusting of

236
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,799
You know fairly strict dress codes which is basically

237
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
A company saying have you don't trust

238
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
You guys to dress

239
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
And it is so much of that

240
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Just fed wrong

241
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
20 year old Toby would not

242
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
You have a career path

243
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
And so

244
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
All the time I was

245
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Stopping kadavy and autograph a cold place

246
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Send the winter months of the year

247
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
But you can run a strategy of

248
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Waiting for, you really have to

249
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Do something before winter

250
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Amiibos go to hell

251
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
And Snowboard Tanaka increasing interval

252
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
As I do I research everything I was about snowboarding wanted to know every option that existed and

253
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Is pek spreadsheets of

254
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Happy technology but you can use to build a snowboard

255
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
And

256
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
At some point.

257
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Click10

258
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Maybe using

259
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
My technical skills

260
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751
How to start an internet business

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Yes I did get a job offer from a fan small local company that

262
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
I was actually interested in looking for but then I went to the basically to sign the papers

263
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,671
Send that one of her top respect

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:19,071
They found out at this point that I needed a book from s2822 it to Eagle allowed to

265
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,447
Be there because I was on the process of getting a permanent residency

266
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
But my status didn't give me both of it and I talked with her friend of family in the

267
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
He said it's going to take you awhile to get this

268
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
You can stop business

269
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Your only option option like I could try to vote remote

270
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
Hopefully again Fortune companies something like this oddly enough that's okay but I couldn't work for logging company

271
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
Doing this I use my technical skills I was thinking of setting up some online so soft

272
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Because I think that would exist and then use that as a way to

273
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Funny White snowboarding hopefully and

274
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Have a good life

275
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
Alright so there's a guy that you met Scott Lake

00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
Who's got booked for Bad Company almost

279
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
Good height for a man to be kept talking and he was a friend of a family and

280
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Exactly

281
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
You were living with where

282
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895

Supportive

286
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
End

287
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Honestly

Kia cerato

289
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
I don't think I could live this

290
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Anyone

291
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
But I can lift

292
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
The damn Bruce I made it incredibly

293
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Baby by Justin Moore

301
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
I got off of the office

302
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
Play time she did all the payroll and accounting and everything

303
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Ascended up

304
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Same company

305
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
So it sits entrepreneurship is Messi

Little Johnny video

307
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,095
But even if you make the choices have to embark

308
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Kind of everyone around you is

309
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Coming onto the trip

310
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
That's a lot of pee

311
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
People went up matter

312
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Sangam

313
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,151
I clearly Was Naive about it I probably would never committed to my surrounding to Aspen

314
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Craziness

315
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Ended up the Journey of Shopify but

316
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Type of shots

317
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
All right so you are

318
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
You're living with a parent

319
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231

Going to work with you

322
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,423
Steven Universe saying hey you know

323
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
What I'm thinking and

324
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
I love Friday I'm a super supportive

325
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Santa

326
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
It was really Scott.

327
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Developing relationships

328
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Deven Dorsett

329
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Doing a lot of a business

330
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Set up and always kind

331
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
Like I'm indecisive

332
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Classical

333
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Co-founder separation

334
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
I was looking out today technology and

335
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Business site

336
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
And I guess your startup cost where not in

337
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Incredibly insanely High

338
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Why because you were doing all the code programming and

339
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
And you have to obviously invest

340
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,567
Money in and snowboards you had to keep some inventory or would you was the idea to wait until orders came in

341
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
What happened in that way

342
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Replay watch the better brand

343
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Inside you wanted to build something

344
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
Something but you hope would become big

345
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
What do you call it by the way

346
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
It was called snowed ever

347
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Sotto voce

348
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
How are you going to get this out into the world

349
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
What's to like make sure peep

350
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
We're aware of it

351
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
So I mean

352
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Step number one

353
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Let's go find Tech

354
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Ended up being a really really important

355
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Mom and I didn't anticipate it because analogy to to like put it up on the internet to start it and then some

356
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Start online first party because

357
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
It's cheaper

358
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
We didn't have a capital for signing a long-term lease

359
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,783
But we wanted to also have a physical

360
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Anthem

361
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
IPad

362
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Maybe a week

363
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
To get the one next to it

364
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
This was my expectation

365
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
You do in a week

366
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Enzai

367
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,143
Trusses. Volume softer Alexander's 2040 top number

368
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Thought so

369
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
I looked at some commercial software with most recording afforded

370
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
They're just got really confused because

371
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
Hi

372
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
2004 sitting in front of my computer absolutely

373
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Stunned realizing

374
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Betty Hutton

375
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Figured out how to build

376
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,087
What's 1 x 1000

377
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
Books from Amazon

378
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
And so you needed a way to get

379
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Photos of the snowboards up on the site

380
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Either way for people to search

381
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
What

382
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Snowboards for available

383
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
How to pay for the

384
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Snowboards and then get a message

385
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
To you somehow that order came through at that you could

386
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,383
And that wasn't easy to find out the Shelf there's no software that would make the

387
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
This easy on Christmas Eve a credit card pot

388
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,295
He also hat I think novel at least modern ideas about what

389
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,183
Hubby wants both upset to look like we wanted to tell stories like every snowboard 50 so obviously

390
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Took on the mountain

391
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
Animal Chronicle the way we spend

392
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
Universal thoughts of a time of emergence of blocking so they had in mind was something that rapped

393
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Good storytelling around products that people are

394
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,359
Excited about trying to break away from the Sears catalog metaphor

395
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
Early

396
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Curious win

397
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
When you and

398
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
And Scott

399
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Exercise

400
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Launch Daredevil

401
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,767
Like that you need but both of you need to put in money to start this and remember how much money you needed

402
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
Bigg Boss put money into the company at

403
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
20000 Canadian dollars

404
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
That's that's a capital P hat

405
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Which was your savings for

406
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Programming

407
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
All I have is

408
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,103
And one thing potatoes

409
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Baggataway lacrosse

410
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
No

411
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Rent snow

412
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Various coffee shops

413
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
I tried to explore

414
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
My new city of Ottawa brightest

415
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,047
Taking random bosses and walking out to the van and coffee shop in Brooklyn from there

416
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Yeah

417
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Alright see you and Scott

418
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
Are working at a cafe

419
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
She posted about

420
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
20000 bucks

421
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
You start sourcing

422
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Snowboards

423
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
But there's no official site

424
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Actually so you decide

425
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm going to write this

426
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
I'm going to do it

427
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
So exactly why I was like

428
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
There's only two ways forward

429
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
I like I compromised

430
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,695
My idea and do something that's a undifferentiated except for snowboards

431
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
Or

432
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
I'm going to fall back on my

433
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Programming

434
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Scouts

435
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
And I would build something bad

436
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Hopefully we'll be able to pull this business

437
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
So what what did you

438
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
How did you start to build it and I guess it was a

439
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
I read about this

440
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
This sort of language that you found called Ruby on Rails

441
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
What was that and why was it so significant

442
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
So

443
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
I had this realization

444
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
But I probably got to be the only problem with avocados

445
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
So

446
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,927
I don't actually have to choose something that lots of people know I can actually choose

447
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Just the best tool for the job

448
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
And so

449
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
Spinda spoken language called Ruby but I just have so much love to give us

450
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,959
People don't usually talk about programming languages like this but I find

451
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
Play I really really love the process of

452
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,639
Constructing something in your brain having this idea is it's a little bit also like

453
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
Painting if you have an idea for something

454
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,527
And then the programming language ends up being

455
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Mechanism for translating the

456
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Perfect picture you have your hat onto a canvas

457
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:16,255
And so you know if you have like an amazing landscape and I get your crayons

458
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
It possible to make a masterpiece of crayons

459
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,191
But if it'll be it'll always be a crayon painting so it's a lot of into a Java in August

460
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:29,567
I just didn't match the way my brain ended up constructing the relationships that make up software

461
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
Ruby was a

462
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:38,015
Thing is I sometimes later Japanese that's only Japanese

463
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
Equitation around this time for it

464
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Elantra language calculator source code

465
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
Anthem

466
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Source code is in

467
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Latin characters

468
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
The instruction manual is in Japanese

469
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
Like I remember. Hey I have the power to choose

470
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,615
And so why don't I go and use Ruby because that would be way more fun

471
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Using this

472
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Coding language

473
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
This program

474
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,831
To build the infrastructure that would allow you how long does it take you to actually build the shop

475
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Happy lunch

476
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
Snorted like a tuna half months later

477
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
So

478
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
It was really good technology

479
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
I mean I also admit I probably spend

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
$6 a day doing this

481
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
So a lot of

482
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,984
Coca-Cola and pizza and Faye and happy life

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Style

484
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
It didn't feel like I was

485
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,408
Doing crazy hours for anything like this and I would never recommend anyone to do this

486
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
But like

487
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
There was literally nothing more in

488
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Cheapest thing in the world

489
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
So was it pretty quick

490
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,880
From the time you launch the website to the time you got your first orders

491
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
It took

492
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Let me let me just

493
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Because

494
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
And I was looking for

495
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
Coffee shops

496
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
I had my first Auto and I usually remember

497
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
I got everything about that day

498
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
As is actually ended up being a really profound experience

499
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Because some

500
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
I wrote the song

501
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
At some point

502
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,896
Doing writing software I actually had to type the email that

503
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
This outfit would send to me yet

504
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
And so

505
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
You know I've been to a coffee shop open my laptop

506
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Anthem

507
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
It was a real order

508
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
From

509
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
Prudential in Pennsylvania no one I ever met

510
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
I really felt like

511
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
I think that's

512
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
The first time

513
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
You saw something

514
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Her first time

515
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
Someone asks you for when the phone rings

516
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Because I'm telling you just

517
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Summit

518
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
Already great but like

519
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
It's that moment and it's something

520
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
But I meet Shopify customer

521
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,760
I often ask them where were you when you got that first order and everyone can remember

522
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,880
And you see your first order and you're thinking oh my got some kind of Pennsylvania's ordering from me

523
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Eyeshadow

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Walk home

525
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
To call Scott because I didn't have a cell phone

526
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,792
Auto and

527
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
LOL score today

528
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,984
People finding out about promotion

529
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Flyers

530
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
But

531
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
Weight of 2012 front right light

532
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Google AdWords

533
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
What's a new product

534
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,296
Birthdays at phone ads for click is $0.20 and

535
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,184
Minimum bets for almost every search for General voting on a $500 box

536
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,536
Google ads

537
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
And there were not that many online snowboard shops so how did Snow devil do

538
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
Is a business degree without my hat really good profit margins on them

539
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
LPS problem bookkeeping and entry and I'm getting inventory back and basically Autumn stock

540
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
But the

541
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,416
Bearden accents you guys recouped your investment pretty quickly

542
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
We had some good amount of savings from from Mass for the next phase

543
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
Scott or did you quickly have to grow and bringing other people to help you with inventory and shipping and fulfillment

544
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,104
Picture of awesome baby dad some Scott fans

545
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,968
Literally driving into the post office

546
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,040
Figured out a way to

547
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Brown paper wrap snowboard

548
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
Shoulder

549
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
Exactly that's exactly what picture

550
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
It was fun

551
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
How do you say to your running

552
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
Snowboard business

553
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
It's going

554
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Pay pretty well

555
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Is making money and I mean

556
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
What happened

557
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Guess what happened

558
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Sesloc obviously in

559
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
Spring and the babysitter

560
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
Begin to conversations around

561
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,040
You not make it really sustainable year on business we need to unite what's a skateboard surfboard

562
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Do something else

563
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
So you were considering

564
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
Hey it's a spring maybe we should do kiteboards and

565
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Skateboards

566
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Things that would have been

567
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
The natural thing to do to go year-round again

568
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,912
Scott and I said you wanted to start over

569
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Location

570
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Cantata

571
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
But I really

572
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Doing bad development

573
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
I said I was no spending

574
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Harvest Time

575
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
I got

576
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
Tweaking the self-guided not stop

577
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
The programming I was just

578
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Okay now let me

579
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
Try things that may make it faster let me use different approaches

580
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,160
And so increasingly I got people sending me emails

581
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
And asked me if I would license no devil

582
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,048
I took them because they want to just said something similar people were saying hey can you

583
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Just license if you built this

584
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Can we use a Ferrari commercial

585
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,496
Right and exact because it was supposed to stiffen it wasn't it wasn't on the grid that was

586
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
I told stories of us

587
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
City Modern

588
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Episode of Victorious

589
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Anthem

590
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Some people were saying I would love to dispute my business based on

591
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Vets Foundation

592
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
Amazing it's it reminds me so much of the story of squares

593
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Squarespace was essentially

594
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Started because

595
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
The founder

596
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
He couldn't

597
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,768
Find a good way to do a Blog and website all in one

598
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
So he basically

599
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
Read his own way to build a website

600
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Wright's Kidizoom selfie

601
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
It's similar store to here

602
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
Yeah but what I needed was

603
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Something that helps me

604
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Inbev

605
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Journey of Entrepreneurship

606
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
From scratch

607
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
I'm not

608
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
That different

609
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
Like if I needed this at some point

610
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
That's going to be

611
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
At least

612
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
Couple thousand people watching

613
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,672
So it was like spring 2005 at some point score tonight

614
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Set

615
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Okay skateboards

616
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Haybuster the office of Bishop.

617
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
So eventually I guess

618
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Bring in the sky Daniel weinand

619
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Who is he in

620
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Why did you bring in the board

621
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,312
Yeah so I decided it's going to be software

622
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
I called Daniel.

623
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,200
Really good friend my best friend really from Joe was in Germany and said hey

624
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Guess what I would like to do and I think I need another

625
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,624
Javier do business to want to spend the summer in Canada and we do this together and

626
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
I like if you could work together on BB fun

627
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,232
To yuan Daniel

628
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Spend that summer

629
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,840
December 2015

630
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,240
You're trying to build this suffer together exactly what point do you stop selling snowboards

631
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,336
Around that time

632
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
How did you come up with a name Shopify for

633
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Software

634
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
Wisconsin idea it was to be talked

635
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
About what it was he wanted it and

636
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Print shop in simplified together

637
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
Was pretty straightforward

638
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
An event

639
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
I think

640
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,096
GoDaddy and fattest uber.com

641
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
I see you got Shopify

642
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Building this thing

643
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,752
Really it sounds like from that

644
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Moments from the beginning you're thinking

645
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,128
This is going to be our business we're going to build

646
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
The software that will enable

647
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
The open e-commerce site

648
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Easily and simply

649
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,112
Yeah so much to building businesses so much complexity in

650
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
Lakers you can order how how does a bunny make it to you how to get ready to get shipping labels from how do you make a truck show up to actually

651
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Except if I

652
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Does office

653
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Metal cigar

654
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Because

655
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
You know that the moment

656
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
That matter described

657
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,824
I got my first sale be good office sale

658
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
From that point on

659
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
I can never get that again

660
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:37,760
But that was such a profound moment like what I want to spend my time on the side

661
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,808
Can I just have other people have attics.

662
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
That became said if a guiding principle of Habibi

663
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
And

664
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
Imagine that you got a

665
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
At some point Reyes somebody to

666
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
Pay for server space pay for

667
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
You know the kind of a

668
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
That cost

669
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Associated with building this

670
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Technology and then

671
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Marketing it

672
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
When did you first

673
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Start to think about

674
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
Bring in some money

675
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
So around that time.

676
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Aspirin

677
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Family for money

678
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
6 mm

679
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Around 5

680
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
You Can't Beat Around

681
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
Like Fiona's parents anyone

682
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
My family I mean

683
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
You know I'm amazing.

684
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
People Trust

685
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
It was $200,000

686
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Which is a

687
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
What do you need $20,000 for What would

688
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
She has to experience up to this point

689
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
This is

690
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
Valuable I know it's valuable because I would have needed it and then more people like me all these sort of like

691
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
People were still

692
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,512
Asking you for this and what were you saying to them were you saying hangover working on something just hold tight will get it to you

693
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
Captive a plug by I should have talked about my experience building it

694
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
I also had a landing page

695
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
Collecting emails

696
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Shopify.com

697
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
And he is like a dam obits

698
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,896
Report of people snow devil to explain why we were doing this and

699
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,224
By the time you launched in 2000

700
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
Sex I think we had flow of 5000 emails so it's not

701
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
But that seems a lot

702
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
All right you've got the seed money

703
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
You've got

704
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Small office

705
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,512
Techni basement office

706
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
SpaceX

707
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Step off the

708
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
Coffee shop I got

709
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,472
Fslr

710
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Play some desk

711
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Santa hats

712
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Buddy Welch

713
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
And it's time to Launch

714
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
You got 4000 emails or so

715
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
From the landing page

716
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
And did you just send like a

717
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Last of email saying

718
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,040
Okay we're live we're here we're ready to go is that how you're not

719
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,112
I'm so just a blast email and what was the response

720
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Some people signed up

721
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
Just try it out if it was really really exciting and

722
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
Cost of business running

723
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
On Shopify

724
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
Set that actually started on that day which

725
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Remarkable

726
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
But it wasn't it was a lot I mean

727
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
Most of our customers

728
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,152
Right to that thing is not bad suddenly something goes wrong

729
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,504
Define responsibility

730
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Free initially

731
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
It started out free

732
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
The first year

733
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,952
We decided against the motor booty affair

734
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
What's it cost in right now because it's going to be so hard to get people to trust us

735
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
That's

736
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,008
Making a cheaper would be more likely for people to give it a try and forevermore

737
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,616
Josh like 3 and 1/2 of 3.75 % for sale

738
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:48,992
It was a complete failure of a business model because but basically everyone who didn't expect to have sales

739
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
But it was amazing and people who

740
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Effector cell.

741
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
That was way too much money so

742
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
We ended up

743
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,304
Switching at a year after launch the night before my wedding for a reason I will never figure out why I did that

744

A couple of thousand accounts that I would say like

Maybe a hundred active

758
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
And

759
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
India to

760

Interesting event I am in business

761
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
I think that Indianapolis

762
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,248
Team won the Superbowl around that time and if they actually had a

763
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
Local newspaper actually had a

764
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Shopify store

765
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
Creative display started like 2 days before Super Bowl

766
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
I just was selling

767
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,280
T-shirts with the front page saying we won the Superbowl

768
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,656
Oh I like a front like a picture on the newspaper would look like if it actually happened to William

769
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Nomadic meaning

770
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
And Sol

771
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,520
Tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands

00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
Douglasville 450 shirts

773
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
On that day

774
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
And that was

775
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Like a stunning

776
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Experience fast because.

777
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
That was so

778
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,576
Fix someone just had a really good idea in an office and turned it into

779
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368

Buena Vista events that are regulating people Birkin

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
Experimenting with online retail Victor new businesses for starting instead of people coming up saying hey View

783
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
Reduce costs and switch to you

784
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
It says it was a slow burn though

785
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
It wasn't like an overwhelming Rush

786
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
She was like in

787
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Incremental

788
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
2006

789
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
2007

790
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
But you're still

791
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
At this point you're still operating off of

792
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Seed money raised and

793
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
Any Revenue you were generating

794
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,392
How is the money situation where you work was it just self-generating were you

795
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
No

796
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
Hike now

797
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
DHEC

798
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Paying customers

799
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Levi going 20120 fast

800
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Like the eventually

801
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Save Bandit

802
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Basically

803
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
Run out of money around this time the

804
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Luckily

805
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
Met an angel investor who ended up

806
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Putting

807
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,040
I think $400,000 around 2017 that saved us is an individual by the name of John Phillips I think part of reason

808
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Find messages because

809
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
His parents been autobahns

810
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,440
I think he wanted something else to do in town to have a nice day

811
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
I visited parents buy CO2 really like

812
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Business

813
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Becoming

814
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,864
Vesta and then basically meant 02

815
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
Is a very prescient investment

816
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
At that time the company was

817
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Is valued at $3000000

818
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
Around this time 2008

819
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Scott Lee

820
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Besides

821
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
I want to move on

822
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,456
What do you remember about that decision

823
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
I mean it was

824
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,392
Hitherto the job of CEO I think he just realized

825
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
At some point.

826
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,000
Vasa Fitness reverse going as most of the people who

827
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Vasilios Baxley

828
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
Highly technical

829
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Parts of the founding teams

830
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
I think he also realized that

831
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
I will end up being the person with a care most about this company in the long run and so

832
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,920
You know that's okay we decided to part ways some more you worried about it cuz he was a CEO

833
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
I was cute avoid about us because

834
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,320
Like I was convinced that I should have a CO2

835
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
But

836
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Someone gave me

837
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Told me that if a great VC investment

838
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
They would have been that the Rope to find

839
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
The right kind of CEO

840
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
And so

841
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
I was like okay well

842
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Maybe I really should talk to her

843
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
I travel to a second to talk about

844
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
PCS 2008 you decide

845
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
I better go to Silicon Valley

846
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Find a venture investor

847
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Who then can help me find a CEO

848
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
So you fly out there

849
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,624
A 2008 with a couple of appointments

850
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah a couple of appointments and then and just

851
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Drinks with

852
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
Friends Central Avenue in Sacramento. Valley

853
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
Absolutely not my intention was

854
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
To build

855
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,824
20 people company that's what I want to do 20-person company super-efficient providing a sock for two people

856
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
A massive company you will be what you wanted to have

857
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Just want a sustainable nice life

858
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,344
I didn't need the money because I didn't think this was Adventure I was building

859
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
And so I vent

860
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,584
Being too worried about the results I was more worried about the amount of money it would cost for me to fly to

861
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Bacteria and accommodation since gone

862
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
Where did you stay

863
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,312
Say a little hostel

864
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,128
The internet

865
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,456
I actually bought that bicycle on on Craigslist

866
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
I was scheduled to be there for a week I ended up staying I think

867
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
True or false

868
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
When I should have maybe because

869
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
What happened pretty quickly if you know I would

870
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,304
Have my first meeting and again visit me biking

871
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,888
From the youth hostel

872
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,752
And showing up and they probably already five who is this

873
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
Cancel

874
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
I would have not

875
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,432
The first meeting and I had my notepads and they would ask me

876
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
Let's start at outside offensive explaining the business and

877
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
But then they would ask me some questions about

878
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,368
You know usage

879
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
Marketside we could have fangs

880
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
And some of us could answer

881
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
And then I would forget really interested

882
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
But the problem was that they quickly they ask me questions

883
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Select favorites questions are on

884
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
Pek ratios and then end lifetime value and always going to think I would

885
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Right on the Tums

886
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
I would rather

887
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Look up

888
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
Usually I would get an equation

889
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Abacus

890
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Some advice but you supposed to apply to business

891
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
Kotor database

892
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,368
And get all the relevant data Tuckerman equation I would get

893
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
The numbers

894
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
So I had one more

895
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Chrismukkah. Select meeting

896
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,840
And and so basically this is how I eventful these meetings I remember that

897
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
I mean I ended up getting

898
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
What kind of time sheets people actually

899
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Franklin Graham

900
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,288
Call David feigenbaum has mostly Benchmark office

901
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:43,200
If someone eating free by the time I kind of figured out

902
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,320
Really worried there were some people were interested some people that interested but all the office for August

903
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Conditioner

904
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Conmovedor company II by

905
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
They all said woohoo

00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
Will support you we going to move it

907
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Yes

908
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
So I got two offers

909
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
I got some sheets

910
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
And some of them

911
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
Referred me to 10 to see yours I had

912
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
Bunch of late-night meetings of people who could take over as CEO because I wanted to play

913
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
I called you that was my dentist

914
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
So I said okay

915
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Clearly

916
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:20,576
If you want to be snow and if I get good numbers you going to give me this late

917
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
I go back

918
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368

Alright I had a customer support initially and then eventually rest of my team told me my English wasn't good enough

923
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
How are you paying peep

924
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
This was now have to be God's angel

925
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592

Send something surprising

1012
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,967

00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,831
Have lots of ideas about starting their own online stores

1014

1015
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
Like I'm going to

1020
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399

Yes

1024
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
You size a measurable change in 2008 2009 would fall off a cliff and what they actually did it

1025
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Usually anticipated

1026
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
A completely different outcome

1027
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
Yes I was ready to think about

1028
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
How to

1029
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
Tell people that I copy payroll

1030
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
Indian stats

1031
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,583
Basically in 2009

1032
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
The company now hit

1033
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
First time for cash

1034
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,239
No neutral like we can ride out whatever downtown this is

1035
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Stop

1036
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Thinking about long-term

1037
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
And I spent like infrastructure projects

1038
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
Okay mean time

1039
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
You are the CEO

1040
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,295
How are you doing as the CEO of the company

1041
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
I'd Market

1042
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:16,511
I mean my team was very very patient with me that was a lot to learn its at 7

1043
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,631
Wonderful things about computer systems can you tell them what to do about

1044
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Keep doing it until you stop

1045
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Lottery

1046
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
And

1047
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
I would say 2009

1048
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,479
To 2010 I truly had for company back from what I could have

1049
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
And should have probably become

1050
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
You held it

1051
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,903
Engineering you know something's always have bottleneck

1052
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
And then the moment you remove fat something else

1053
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
Same goes for companies at this point

1054
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
I intentionally slow down

1055
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
The growth of a company a little bit just

1056
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,191

But I can stop by three times before breakfast

1114
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959

It just means so much changes everyone's life story to a significant degree right

1119
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
How did you manage that issue

1120
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015

Program to actually often wasn't the best use of my time and

1125
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,815
Did you talk to Fiona about it

1126
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
Around this 2009.

1127
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Like really wavering on the

1128
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
Decision right which is like you built

1129
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
A stable

1130
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Lifestyle business

1131
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
Split Shopify

1132
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663

Cyborg look at my bank account

1137
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:59,231

1138
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
If it was going up

1139
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
Basically is that okay

1140
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:06,399
Should be investments in another team member or should we attempt

1141
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
The marketing

1142
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
So I finally said okay I'm going to save

1143
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
And try

1144
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543

Then I have to go fundraising again and actually go on the clock to what's an IPO or to eventual exit

1148
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,599
Is the money really needed

1149
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
For marketing

1150
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159

00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Held back by not engaging

1152
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487

The Misfits took a little bit longer but we release a book on

1162
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
The concept

1163
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087

Stressful or overwhelming it was a helpful

1186
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
I thought it was very helpful

1187
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,959
I've always had a fantastic relationship with all the people invest

1188
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007

1189
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031

I think

1198
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,807
Our relationship has always been bigger all on the same side

1199
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
A hope

1200
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
But anyways I'm fairly quick study

1201
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951

1230
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
Instead of you spending a bunch of money

1231
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
On fundraising

1232
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807

Because you can feel this way

1236
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
Baby basically set

00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
Yeah yeah exactly

1240
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
It was just so obvious

1241
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
And this is why I said earlier that I had

1242
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Company back

1243
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Because

00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
What explains the

1248
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Freaking out

1249
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
I think I was looking at what I had to do like the

1250
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Hrpro

1251
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415

1254
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Perpetually

1255
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,679
Exploding rocket ship right now on top of all that that's happening I could not the other

1256
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
I need it

1257
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,495
Take another year of Abreva

1258
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775

Beautiful Sphinx

1260
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,663
2012 I think you finally move out

1261
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
From Fiona's

1262
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
Parents place you have a kid at this point

1263
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,807
Today you've got three

1264
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:45,183
I want to say it must have been 2014 that they actually moved out

1265
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,255
So it was a living

1266
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:52,863
Actually raised a hundred million dollars in 2013

1267
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,239
You're still nervous about I was making basically minimum wage so

1268
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,639
Give me more money I would have probably given it back because I think I could use better than I did

1269
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:10,015
So that's your lifestyle wasn't then require whole lot of money

1270
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
As long as I have my laptop I was good

1271
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:17,695

Like 300 employees

1276
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,287
But you're still under the radar like like no one knew who you were

1277
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:38,687
Yeah I like better by Design

1278
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,759

Our job is to make our Merchants look. Like this is why they exist

1280
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,719

1281
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,279
Peace and blessings be with me ask me

If it just doesn't stay so if I don't go to South Africa

1288
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:19,135
Other people's lives it's been other people go to home on internet and so on

1289
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487

You just moved out of your inlaws house

1295
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063

1296
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111

1297
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647

1298
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,743

What came out of it

1304
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
But I love

1305
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175

Talked about this

1309
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
In the early

1310
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Days of

1311
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,367
Going for Pia after a week off

1312
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391

1314
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439

Thinking cap

1318
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
Schlotzsky's kind of fishes

Heavyset

1320
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
WK

1321
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
Because you know what

1322
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
No matter what we going to do now

1323
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
This is going to be proud of all of our life

1324
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103

00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
I can fall of us

1329
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
You guys

1330
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Go public

1331
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
In 2015

1332
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
You went public

1333
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Because presumably

1334
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Your investor

1335
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Just wanted you wanted

00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
It's a kind of give them return

1337
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
This is

1338
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
15 people

1339
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
Started giving you money in

1340
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Mm

00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,055
4 is that the reason why you went

1342
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,895
He probably would have become the reason eventually but not at this

1343
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Point of time because

1344
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,295
Ben basement only happened 5 years before that and

1345
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599

Map us to Tuality of about coming by way of

1350
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
This is true for Evie

1351
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
A person who sells

1352
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
The company

1353
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Just most people don't realize

1354
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
What's happening

1355
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
But I've been in

1356
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,055
Into the Venture of a pretty clear about what it means

1357
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
And so I really wanted

1358
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
To set up a company to become an independent

1359
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
Papa Company because

1360
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
My private investors have all seen Shopify

1361
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,807
Perform under-promise over-deliver

1362
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,367
Month after month and vomiting after board meeting

1363
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
All of them

1364
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
40 trusses

1365
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,487
The company and and fervor good performance was not fillet

1366
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
Buying us in it

1367
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:12,703
More than 800 thousand Shopify merchants

1368
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Will have

1369
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
Purchase something on a site that's powered by Shopify

1370
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,639
Does a very good shape since we talked about

1371
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
That's

1372
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,711
Decimals gratifying

1373
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,271
Numbers relate to shop for and it's active now.

1374
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
A B-52

1375
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
2 seconds

1376
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,135
Someone has that experience of getting up

1377
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
For sale

1378
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
The one that are described

1379
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,487
And so many cases

1380
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Someone

1381
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,559
Is going from being a builder

1382
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,375
Turned out being an entrepreneur

1383
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
That's so few things but you can do that actually change

1384
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,263
Joe identity to a meeting for the great red

1385
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,287
Anthem

1386
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
Bus companies

1387
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,919
Hardest really really thought process and trying to

1388
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,455
Make this simpler

1389
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,295
What's been so fascinating inside this initial idea

1390
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,135
Behind snow devil the idea that being able to write

1391
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,975
Computer software is like a specialized to Alana on a climbing trip

1392
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:13,375
If I wouldn't have a specialist with me I would have had to turn around because someone's I just couldn't have

1393
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
And then

1394
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:19,519
What's up family is it's a selfie I wish it would have found ride like a text all these

1395
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,639
Vertical balls and transform into insights like they're not it's not flat

1396
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
Select still how to build a business

1397
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:33,087
But at no point do you need exactly because of that significantly more

1398
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,623
People succeed in building

1399
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Because

1400
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
I just noticed

1401
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,975
Discouraging experiences

1402
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279
Which make you give up even though you shouldn't have

1403
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
And so

1404
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,887
Body found at the best thing we can do for the pesos of Shopify

1405
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
It's fine

1406
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,447
Another one of us thinks which is

1407
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,751
An incline and just flapping it

1408
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,055
Best much as you can every single time you do it

1409
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
More people succeed and more businesses

1410
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
Kobe in 2004

1411
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455

1412
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
5 years ago

1413
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,831
You'd moved out of your in-laws

1414
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
Place

1415
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Today

1416
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,999
Easily the biggest employer in Ottawa aside from the federal government

1417
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
You are

1418
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
Wealthier than you can

1419
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,375
If ever imagine and might be

1420
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Weird

1421
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
To be a

1422
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
Billionaire

1423
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,727
I mean it's

1424
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
Totally

1425
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Music

1426
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,079

00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
Honestly even know about Utah

1428
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Talk about assistance

1429
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,479
Crazy to me I probably

1430
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
Try to just don't think too much about it

1431
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
It's

1432
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
Hugely gratifying but it's also

1433
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,415
I think the important thing is just that I

1434
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,719
I remind myself how much

1435
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
The most amazing work coming

1436
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Wonderful

1439
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,423
Time to support us along the way

1440
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,471
Incredible timing

00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
Off Wendy status

Basically all I can do is enjoy it and then

1463
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Be honest about what happened

1464
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
Yeah and then

Hey thanks for sticking around

1504
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
I know for how you built that

1505
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,855
And today story starts about

1506
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
4 years ago in Houston Texas

1507
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
When was

1508
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,231
Babysitting her granddaughter

1509
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
It was quickly running out of things to do with her

1510
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,375
I mean I wanted to take her to Gymboree and I wanted to

1511
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,655
Take her to the park

1512
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,471
But then I said but wait I can't really put her in the

1513
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,055
The car seat in the car seat

1514
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,103
Because she has arthritis in your thumb

1515
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,175
And pushing the big red button to release the

1516
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Buckle

1517
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
It's hard

1518
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,575
Yes it's very hard if I mean it's just even people that can do it sort of hate it

1519
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,391
Because they have to struggle and it hurts for safety reason

1520
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,951
It actually takes about nine pounds of

1521
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,255
Pressure to release that red button

1522
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,815
How do you do that if you don't have enough

1523
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
Strengthen your hand

1524
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
Fortunately for Barb it

1525
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Turns out she had

1526
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,519
The perfect set of skills to solve this problem I'm an occupational therapist

1527
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,127
Which means her job is to help people with disabilities accomplish daily tasks

1528
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,943
So using some pliable plastic that

1529
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,223
She had lying around the house

1530
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,575
Fart made a tool that could help her release the buckle on Eve's car seat

1531
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,879
It's kind of a a c shape

1532
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,903
Device

1533
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,207
And the upper arm has a

1534
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,487
Hague in the center

1535
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
So can you take this

1536
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Complexity

1537
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
You slide it under the car seat

1538
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:09,983
Buckle you place the peg over the red button and then you push and you kind of pants and that

1539
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,775
Will release the buckle

1540
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Super simple ideas

1541
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,127
Actually work the first time Barb tried it

1542
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
I was pretty excited and

1543
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,271
Honestly just started using it and it was really Rebecca that said Mom

1544
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
There's probably other people that would like this

1545
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,695
Enter Barb's daughter Rebecca Rebecca is

1546
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
And she also happens to have a

1547
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Background

1548
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
In business

1549
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
I think I said to her I said Mom

1550
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,607
You know what if we what if we made this

1551
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Consoled

1552
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
You know I've always had an entrepreneurship in the back of my mind but neither Rebecca nor bar of new if they were really

1553
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Rihanna something

1554
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,127
Sowell Barb kept working on different prototypes

1555
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,175
To get the clamp exactly right

1556
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,735
Rebecca started a poke around a little too

1557
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Do some research

1558
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,855
So I asked him learning about the ABC Kids Expo

1559
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
One of the largest

1560
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
Juvenile product trade shows in the country

1561
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
And we ended up going it was kind of a last-minute decision truly travel to Las Vegas

1562
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Go to this big mansion

1563
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
Oh my gosh it was

1564
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,191
It was amazing it was one of the most

1565
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,007
You know energizing experience as I can remember

1566
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,055
People just thought I thought

1567
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,359
Yes that is a need and that is

1568
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,663
Solving a problem it's in the market

1569
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,711
Game all the traditional milestones

1570
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,015
Kickstarter campaign finding a man

1571
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,575
Manufacturer and delivering the first orders

1572
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
But then

1573
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
A not-so-happy sign of

1574
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Success

1575
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
Other vendors were starting to copy their device

1576
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,023
Hey. It's kind of a gut punch

1577
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,815
When you see it we just both went

1578
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
It makes you feel just so defeated because

1579
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
Yeah you know that they haven't gone through

1580
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,239
The sweat in the

1581
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:51,103
Alliterations in the bucket full of prototypes Rebecca and Barb did manage to get

1582
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,895
Two patents for the product

1583
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,711
They've been able to shut down some of the knockouts

1584
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
Meanwhile Rebecca says that

1585
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
By going into business with her mom

1586
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
Chia seeds

1587
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Tirely new side of her

1588
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
When it comes to this business I think my mom

1589
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,975
You know it is such a go-getter and she's

1590
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:11,327
Get on the phone and we'll call up retailers and yeah she's got the hustle and

1591
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,887
It's really been that kind of a cool experience

1592
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Rebecca Davidson

1593
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
Bob Hammons products

1594
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:23,615
It's called unbuckleme online and it's a major chains like buybuybaby

1595
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
And since they launched the business two years ago they made about $350,000 if you want to

1596
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
