Open the doors to Home Depot and is there just a mad rush of people to come in

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
Not as expected to be a mile safe and so we

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
We agreed we weren't going to talk to each other the morning

24
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:56,320
Open up into stores and my three older children

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
They were each given $500 1 in $1 bills so it's 6 at night

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Hi there was standing from the store still handing out $1 bills so we had this grand opening and nobody came

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Fired from corporate job in mid 30s

00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Plan for a new company

33

The Home Depot

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
1979

35
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
When Home Depot opened it

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
First store in Atlanta

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
The world course

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
Other hardware store

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Time there was nothing

40
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Quite like home

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
For starters it was huge

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
Almost twice as big as its

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Competitors

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
And second

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Did I forget things like

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
Free workshops and staff who could

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Tell you how to feel

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Make stuff at home

49
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
But most importantly

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Home Depot

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Sheep-like

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
10 to 20% cheaper than other hardware stores

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,776
Initially Home Depot wasn't a sure thing in fact on day one

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
It wasn't

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Clear it would work

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
But today

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Home Depot is a company that does almost

58
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
A hundred billion dollars

59
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
An annual revenue

60
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
And it's one of the 10 biggest private Employers in the US

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
In the story of how Arthur Blank

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
And his mentor Bernie Marcus built it

63
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,512
Will inspire anyone who's ever been fired because

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
If those guys had never got fired

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Safe

66
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
And comfortable corporate jobs

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
They have never started Home Depot

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Arthur and Bernie no longer run the company

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Anybody still on Lots

70
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
So shares

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
And Home Depot's made them rich

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
Arthur blank's net worth

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
Is estimated at more than four

74
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Billion dollars

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
He is beloved in his adopted hometown of

76
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Atlanta

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Are they part of that has to do with his

78
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Stewardship

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Are the Atlanta Falcons

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Arthur Blank sit down with me in front of a live audience

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
At the Buckhead Theater in Atlanta

82
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
And we started out by talking about

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Boyhood

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
And throwing up in Flushing New York

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128

87
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
My Lord

89
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Probably fighting with my brother

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,696
That would be one your brother your mom and your dad

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,792
Exactly I we live in a small apartment it was a it was a one-bedroom apartment

00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
1 bathroom

93
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,448
Share that share the actually my brother and I share the bedroom and my mom and dad slept in a little

94
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Pull out

95
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Thing in the foyer

96
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
I went out in the morning

97
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Stayed out all day and

98
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Came home and it got dark and

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
And it was of you are middle-class

100
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Family regular middle-class family yes

101
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
What is your what is your dad do

102
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
My dad was a pharmacist

103
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,256
He passed away when he was 44 I was 15 at the time

104
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
Several years before that is left

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
He was working for his his brother in a retail drug store

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
And I started his own

107
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,335
Pharmaceutical Distribution Company to hospitals and nursing homes and doctors across the country

108
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,431
When he passed away my mother was only 37 at the time and

109
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,063
Without any business background she went in and started to run the business

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
My mother was

111
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
One of these

112
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
People which to know the failure was not

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Part of her

114
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Vocabulary shoes

115
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,863
Was going to succeed and she was going to do whatever it took to be successful in the business and

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
I would go to school and and

117
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Who's playing football in in

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Do my football practice come home

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Start dinner

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Did the family laundry and

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
Just did a variety of things to support

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
The house is best I could and and

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Try to be

124
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
As good a friend to my mother's I could be I'm able periodically out that would take her and go bowling and I remember one time

125
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
She was very young look

126
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Somebody would ask

127
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Is that your girlfriend is it on that's my mother actually. Not my girlfriend but

128
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
She was always very young at heart very young

129
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Spiritual up

130
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
The dance

131
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Very much for caring

132
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
You went off to college at Babson

133
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
College is a small

134
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Business college MSU

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
What song was that

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Was that your intention to get into business

137
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,855
Set of school well I think really what happened after my dad died

138
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
We will talk about what's going to happen to the family business

139
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
You know my mother would

140
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
You know get remarried

141
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
She did

142
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Exceeded our wishes

143
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Did several times over

144
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
She will laugh at that too but she wouldn't she unplug my mother with me

145
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
I think that would be very funny

146
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
So

147
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
But in any event

148
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
So my brother was going to take over the

149
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Pharmaceutical

150
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,159
I would take off the business end of the business so that was really the plan he went to pharmacy school I went to Business School

151
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
And was able to develop

152
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Skills in terms of

153
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
I had to work with others and be inclusive and

154
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
I am NBA go later so

155
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
That was very important to me in college

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
So out of college I guess you start work as an accountant right for a couple years

157
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Five years but

158
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
I kind of realized during that period of time

159
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Didn't want to spend

160
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
The rest of my life

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Recording what other people were doing and making sure the books are balanced and all that kind of stuff and giving good order advice

162
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Want to be on the other side of the desk if you will

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631
Or I would actually was going to help make the decisions and help Drive the business and build a businesses

164
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,983
So I guess it was in your mid-twenties early twenties you wouldn't work for a company called

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Daylon

166
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
What was what was Balaam

167
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
Daelin was a conglomerate when that word was

168
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Real fancy Andrew high PE ratios the Great Bridge are the company ended up being in the bankruptcy

169
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,647
I was running a chain of drugstores originally started out as a CFO there

170
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
We were the only part of company that was making any money

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
And had a small Home Improvement Center

172
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
Company in California called handy Dan Home Improvement centers

173
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
There were also making a little bit of money but the rest

174
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
The companies are losing money so

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
I had an option

176
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
Stay there and continue just to run the business as your was

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,199
Or potentially go to California I met my partner at HD Bernie Marcus

178
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,807
Through through Dale and Bernie was running the discount store division for them

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
That wasn't doing well and so that's why I was

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
20

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
For 5 years old

182
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
I mean I was a young man

183
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
Just ask just to clarify you were right you were the CEO of

184
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
The drug stores that very loud

185
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
And Bernie was involved with their disc

186
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Is Right both of us businesses were sort of

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031

00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735

Consumed by a quake of some sort but she ended up

206
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
She ended up coming and

207
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
And

208
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207

So and I always consider the Home Depot to be my seventh child so

216
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
You start working for Handy Dan

218
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Bernie Marcus

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831

221
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
I guess about 14 15 years older than you

222
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
What

223
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
Was he sort of like a mentor to you

224
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Yeah Bernie is

225
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
He's 14 years my senior in

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Probably

227
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
You know a combination of brother and a father figure

228
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
Have I lost my dad and a rabbi

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Pisces always consider himself to be a rabbi and

230
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
And so I

231
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
And he's a great storyteller

232
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
The great joke teller

233
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
And I'm not agree

234
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
Storyteller but I'm great audience he would tell the same stories and I would keep laughing at the same stories high was it was like

235
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
Make a great partnership because he loves hearing you know me laughing

236
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
It was like a marriage it was like a marriage

237
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Was like a very good marriage

238
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,703
So what did you what did you and Bernie start to do at Handy Dandy

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Did you start to

240
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
If you were trying to make this

241
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Listen to a successful company

242
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
So what were some of the things that you were doing at that company

243
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Experimenting with it

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
The company at the time

245
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
That company ended in Home Improvement centers

246
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
Was we operated kind of a traditional model 40,000 square ft 40% gross margin 40 Associates on the

247
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Lafleur

248
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
And it was it was by far the most

249
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Successful chain homes

250
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,167
Stores in the country then and we had a tax treaty with our parent company parent company being dalen

251
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,751
And so we would send our tax money instead of going to

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
To the government we sent it directly to

253
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
Today lanzhou favorite child

254
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
In that company cuz we were kind of keeping the company

255
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Afloat if you will with our tax

256
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
At some point the parent company was bought by guy named Sanford

257
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Sigilyph

258
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391

Right

263
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
Maybe that's right and he actually clear Nova 2

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
And he comes into the company

265
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447

And Bernie

272
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087

You know self-confidence drawing people

276
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Sandy had a difficult time because basically all the profitability all the cash flow from Dale and was coming from

277
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
Buddhist Home Improvement Center company

Burning was properly and taking credit for the results that we were producing

Saint didn't like that so this is you know War of the Giants and they own more stock and

Transfer background that I had we had saved up some money I wasn't you know

00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
We wanted to think about outside the box

318
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655

Could we not compete again

323

324
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687

369
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Have it makes some sense to be plausible but

370
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,959
Reality is that the investors who invest in our company 144 them

371
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
Really what they were buying into was

372
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
Myself and burning

373
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,455
We had the experience and they look back at Handy Dan Home Improvement centers and they said

374
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,295
We're betting on people here we're not going to bet on the on the on my Mac

375
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Experience on that smallest

376
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Arthur why did you guys

377
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Decide to

378
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,255
Start this company in Atlanta you were based in Southern California the time

379
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
How did you

380
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Pick this area

381
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
William lived in in Atlanta

382
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
The chain of drugstores was based

383
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
In Griffin Georgia

384
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
Rite Aid Griffin is the first city

385
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
South of Atlanta

386
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
I always remembered

387
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
Atlanta was a Grove City Grove Market I love the city

388
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
So we asked for any let's

389
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
You know let's go to Atlanta and you know that time this is so hard to imagine because Atlanta even today

390
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
Qualifies as a national park based on number

391
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Countries that

392
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,375
Are still up in Atlanta despite all development here but there was less than a million people living in Atlanta with that time

393
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
So I drove over

394
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
Burning around Atlanta look at the sites

395
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
The 285 witch

396
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
Everybody is familiar with it

397
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
All I could see was trees

398
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
And so every once in awhile every 10 minutes when we say there's nobody living here author

399
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Drive around for a little bit she almost walked the other division subdivisions get back on Highway Drive some more

400
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,303
Still not enough because nobody here at the Bahamas all these trees so we did that like

401
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,655
The two hours we drove around 285 and got off and with the subdivision so

402
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
Finally we became convinced that Atlanta would be an important growth Market that was even growing their antlers

403
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Less than a million people

404
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,967
We open up here in 1979 and today is something not to 7 million people

405
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
On that opening day in 1979

406
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
You raise the money

407
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
To open two shops here in Atlanta

408
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,815
You open the doors to Home Depot and is there just a mad rush of people to come in

409
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
Not as expected to be a mile safe and so we

410
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
We agreed Bernie and I went to one store and I bought the Pat and other associates obviously went to the other side

411
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Store we agreed to talk to each other the morning and my three oldest children

412
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
They were each given $500 1 in $1 bills and I told them

413
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
I told him I'll be back in school by 11:12 at the very latest so it's 6 at night

414
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
It was standing from the store still handing out $1 bills so we had we had this grand opening and nobody came

415
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
Then just a minute how the Home Depot went from a flop on opening day

416
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:02,015
To the largest Home Improvement chain in the world stay with us at guy Rosner listening to her

417
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,599
How I built this from NPR

418
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
Support for this NPR Podcast comes from American Express open

419
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Listeners to how I built this

420
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Curious

421
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,959
Curious about have good ideas became great businesses and chances are

422
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,775
You have some good ideas of your own but as you know

423
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
And business there can be a lot of roadblocks

424
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,431
American Express open knows how hard it can be to get things done

425
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
Anyone help with money and know-how

426
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,807
So you can turn those ideas into action

427
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Is it open. Com

428
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

429
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Gyros

430
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Arthur Blank

431
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,679
And his business partner Bernie Marcus open their first two stores

432
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,239
In the Atlanta area in 1979

433
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
To say the least it didn't

434
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
Quite go as expected

435
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
It's over the next year they were

436
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Really hard identify what

437
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Wasn't working

438
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
And they experimented with different pricing and if

439
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Merchandise

440
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Try and get more customers

441
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Into the front door

442
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
We spent really the next year in

443
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,279
One of our core values is to listen and respond and is listening I

444
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,399
Probably spend 75% of my time as did Bernie has the really most of our Associates

445
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
On the floor of the store finding out from

446
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,543
Customers what is it they like what didn't like in a week

447
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,407
Kept changing the mix adding things taking things off changing prices changing assortments

448
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Changing vendors

449
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,551
Making sure we have service levels in areas they wanted them to be kept refining the model

450
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Every competitor

451
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
Came into our stores and visit us and said

452
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
I'm in these

453
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Bad Words lyrics

454
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Satellite radio thing but

455
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
These whatever you want to cause they're crazy

456
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
The sores are much too big

457
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
Prices are much too low

458
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
What way too much product

459
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Stock

460
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
They're too many services I mean the math isn't going to work

461
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
And of course the math

462
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
There in 79 was it working is great

463
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Fine-tuned got it where it needed to be

464
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,087
Exploding 80 and 81 and the numbers were incredible

465
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
And we went public in 81 obviously we got a grape

466
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
You know what great reception

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
And

468
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,864
Then it's a long story after that but that point forward we knew we going to be yours

469
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,776
I asked you about how you and Bernice thought of the company and you have two of course I agree

470
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
On what it's going to be worth of values

471
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
The company are

472
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
So what were the core values of Home Depot

473
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,504
Well I think that you know we never

474
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Really wrote them down

475
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,624
I remember I went to lunch with Bernie and I said you know

476
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Will living these values

477
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
By far and away is the most

478
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Most important thing that we

479
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
We can do but they're not

480
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Down

481
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
And

482
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
Imma give you some shocking news today that I've kind of figured out

483
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
And know to be true and that is that

484
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,872
You and I are going to approve a lot of stores in the future that we will actually never say will never be in the moon ever get a chance

485
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Imemories

486
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Stop eating lunch

487
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
But the night before, so you're not sick

488
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
It's crazy how can we prove stores and ever go visit him I said Bernie cuz we

489
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
Will we spend about half our time and our stores and I said if you do the math of it we visit

490
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Certain numbers

491
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
About resisting storage every year

492
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
And

493
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
We just realized that

494
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Go to any new stores

495
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Choice we need to document lead to write down

496
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
And

497
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
You know I think the beauty of our core values

498
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,896
But you're really focused on our Associates and people in relationships

499
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
Jefferson Community and giving back and

500
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
The people who was serving Drive everything that we doing

501
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
Those are the ones that we listen to those two months

502
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
Respond to those ones we care for those ones who nurture

503
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
And

504
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
That's the mentality of

505
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
The training that we

506
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
We've given to Oliver

507
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
You went Home Depot went from

508
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
0 Revenue in 1979

509
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,936
To 700 million in 1985

510
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
The fastest company in US history

511
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
840

512
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Billion dollars

513
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,384
In Revenue how did you manage that growth was that overwhelming

514
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
Facestory Sam Walton

515
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
The Saints and what was

516
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Who founded Walmart

517
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Sam was

518
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Speaking

519
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
At a retail conference I went to and somebody ask them in the company gone from

520
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
10 billion

521
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Bodybuilding

522
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Open today I don't know

523
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
What they own half

524
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
Like what

525
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Between a man Amazon

526
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
But but you said about how did you get from 10 to

527
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
20 billion dollars

528
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Samsung open up

529
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
And it's all we did

530
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
And so really it HD

531
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:47,200
We had a five-year plan we had a one-year budget we had all of that but we focus

532
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
On every single

533
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Store an AR

534
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Plan was that

535
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Each store had to be better than the last so we opened

536
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
So we didn't have any planograms we didn't have any

537
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,280
You have to do it this way we didn't let the model

538
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Frozen we didn't let it

539
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
We made the

540
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Quotes running the store think about

541
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,728
This is the last or how do I make this store better

542
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
How do I own it

543
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
How do I feel accountable for it

544
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
How do I inject my ideas into it how do I make it

545
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
Every store got better

546
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
What about your

547
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Personal life

548
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
I mean did it take a toll on the table

549
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Time you were able to spend it

550
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
With your kids your family and you must have work been working

551
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
All the time

552
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Heiken Ashi

553
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
I told guys do you want to talk

554
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,728
I think it's one of the things I'm most proud of my oldest daughter who she was running a nonprofit

555
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Prefer

556
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,896
For young women in San Francisco and when they did a retirement dinner for me in 2001 she couldn't be there

557
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Couldn't get away and she

558
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Did a video piece

559
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
She sounded

560
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
Still remember you know

561
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
What you said there is

562
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
Is Dad you know I never realized what's going up in

563
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Decisive

564
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
The Home Depot and

565
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Exacerbate

566
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Because

567
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,608
You always there for me you always events that were important to me always there when I was doing dancer

568
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Josiah was always there you know important

569
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
School programs whatever it maybe and

570
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
And I

571
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,800
Worked around the kids schedule and I would

572
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
Work early in the morning I work late at night

573
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
Them to bed and work after that

574
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
So

575
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
I always made sure there was balance in my life

576
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Turn and I think

577
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
You know

578
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Often asked by Young Folks

579
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
Most people younger than me

580
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
So it's easier

581
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
Find people that want that advice today but I always tell him you know

582
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Make sure you have balance in your life and in because

583
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400

Memphis gear and go go go and

587
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
So when you return home and

588
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
10 years you're not going to recognize you

589
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
The kids and you

590
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Do spouses look at you and say

591
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Who are you again

592
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,088
So I think it's important

593
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
How to find balance in your life

594
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Use

595
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Step down

596
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,864
Stepped away from the company left the company at a pretty young age were 58

597
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
2001

598
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Why did you leave

599
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Will you just

600
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,824
Your time there was that time I mean I done

601
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
I'm in the early days

602
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
In the company of the first

603
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,992
I don't know how many years but no that was a 23-year. Of time that it was

604
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,904
It was great fun with all these Adventures starting a new business you know going half broke figure out how to work through that

605
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
Let me know responding to customers and

606
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
As time went on

607
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
I spent found myself spending more time in meetings more time doing things that I had to do that were part of the job and

608
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,240
Didn't dislike doing them but they weren't as much fun for me anymore

609
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
So when I really felt that 23 years was

610
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
A long time for

611
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
Somebody in my position first

612
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
Is President later CEO and chairman and what have you and

613
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016

615
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
Partnership I mean was really more like

616
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Two brothers work

617
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
Working together two partners working together thanks

618
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
Sing Elsa and you still write

619
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,816
Well I talked to himself as I can be probably had

620
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Two dinners in a lunch

621
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Blastoise

622
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656

623
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240
So I see him see him a lot and you know it

624
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
It's always great to

625
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
To do that so

626
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
I felt the time was right

627
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
That we

628
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,480
Began to do a search the board found a candidate that was

629
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Bob nardelli

630
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Get some hisses

631
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
You folks in the audience

632
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
But they bought in Bob nardelli

633
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
I see y'all appointment

634
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
That decision and

635
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
And I was

636
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Sure happy I wasn't there during the

637
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Six years that he was there

638
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Sol

639
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
That would have been the worst time in my life

640
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,288
But that but that was a time in your life when you really made your

641
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Biggest mark on the city of Atlanta by buying

642
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Falcons

643
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,760
Can you explain what was the

644
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
I mean what did you this Burning passion

645
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
To own

646
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
The Falcons was it

647
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Was it

648
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Assertive a chance to

649
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Run a business again what was the thinking behind

650
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Behind doing

651
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Well I was a season ticket holder

652
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
Since I had moved to Atlanta and

653
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,264
I didn't realize this but the commissioner before the Commissioner Goodell commission attack of Boo

654
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,872
The clothes you want to pull out the same you said you really see me just bought has never had back-to-back winning season

655
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,480
And I said Paul I didn't oppose the smartest guy in the room because you told you so

656
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Cuz you really was

657
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
The smartest guy in the room

658
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
I said that can't be correct

659
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,856
So I went back and I check my turn.

660
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
So I realized all those years and I was a

661
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:51,584
Season ticket holder and I would have such angst over the Falcons I understood why because it was going to constantly

662
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Like that song

663
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
I said to myself I can

664
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Either

665
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
And complain about if the neck

666
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
You know 40 years of my life

667
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Just try to buy the team and fix it

668
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
So

669
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
So I

670
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
Felt you know buying a senior fishing you seem like more fun

671
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
You watching the Play Endless games and what have you so that was in mm

672
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
And one

673
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
And I just

674
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
Finishing up part 17 Sierra

675
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
As owner

676
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:26,656
You have to know if we had multiple back-to-back winning seasons MO

677
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Multiple championships

678
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
Play

679
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
Well last year in the Super Bowl we just

680
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,408
We forgot there was a fourth quarter in the game they play really well for three quarters and

681
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Somehow

682
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
You know

683
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
This is Ben

684
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
To say the least a

685
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
An interesting year and then the NFL

686
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,464
Do you feel like players who are trying to bring awareness

687
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
To the way our criminal justice is

688
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Treats

689
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Black men and women vs

690
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
White

691
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
By not standing for the national anthem

692
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Do you feel like that

693
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
Well I have tubal

694
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
I I I think it's

695
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
I think it's

696
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
It's less susceptible

697
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
To deny people

698
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
The first

699
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:15,552
So I think that's what's the traffic to work

700
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Having said that

701
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
I mean I think that

702
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Players

703
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Should stand

704
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
And it should and should Sam especially for the national anthem

705
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,352
And I will tell you there was 1750 players in the NFL and I will tell you her

706
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,424
These players have great respect for the military

707
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
And

708
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
So it's not about the military

709
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Just that

710
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
McCombs and

711
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
Opportunity platform

712
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
For them

713
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
To speak about

714
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
There

715
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
Concerns about social injustice

716
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
Police accountability

717
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
Their focus is on turning that platform down to progress

718
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
On these issues and making sure that

719
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,720
Owners and organizations in America are listening

720
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
Two voices that cannot be heard

721
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:03,680
And I think I'm more for that thing

722
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,312
How much of your is a question asked everybody comes in the show

723
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,360
How much of your success

724
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,456
Do you attribute to your intelligence in your hard work and how much of it took

725
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
Luck and timing

726
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
I think that walking timing is a big deal

727
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
I'm in a really do

728
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
A lot of it is

729
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Success

730
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,696
Is based on timing La Cadena my place but then seizure

731
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Opportunities I think I am willing to
