To get yours

26
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,056
I used to hire an interview every person that walked in that brand

27
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
And then I didn't anymore and all of a sudden there were people working on my brand that I never met with

28
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
4

29
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
And then I might not have hired and you know it was a struggle and I tried to let go of the deep

00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Details

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Then I realized the details what makes the company so special and so

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
I kept thinking I could fix it if we could just do this if I could get this it could be better

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752
And it didn't get better

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
From NPR

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712

Artist named Bobby Brown

40
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
Dealt a billion dollar line of cosmetics by doing what

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Making women look

42
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Like a fart wearing

43
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Any makeup

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Why is a kid back in the 90

45
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
My older sister

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Add a collection of those

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Porcelain Mardi Gras masks on

00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Blue eyeshadow and

00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
The reddest lipstick no human good

55
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Anything about those masks

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
They looks like models you see on the cover of fashion

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
Models didn't hide their makeup makeup

58
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
That was loud

59
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Brash

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
The look

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Was anything but net

62
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
This is the world that Bobby Brown

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Kind of broke into

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
As a young makeup artist in the fashion in the

65
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
She loved everything about makeup

66
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Except

67
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
The weight actually made people look

68
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,096
And so she was searching for a way to use it so that models look

69
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
Like they weren't really wearing it at all

70
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
So you know lipstick that was the

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
The color of

72
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Actual lip sore

73
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Blush.

74
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Make you look like you were blushing

75
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
Eyeshadow that matches your skin tone

76
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,224
Spell particularly revolutionary

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Today but

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
When Bobby Brown started to bash together off-the-shelf cosmetics

79
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Come up with a new look

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
She was trying something

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Totally different

82
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
She was

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Trying to convince women that

84
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Makeup

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
The bee well

86
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Almost invisible

87
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
In summer fellow makeup artist

88
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
She-Devil zero left

89
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
Trying to sell that natural look

90
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
But of course today

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
Cosmetics is a brand that's been estimated to generate over a billion dollars of Revenue

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Year a year

93
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
And Bobby never thought of herself as a businesswoman

94
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,136
She didn't set out to design a whole new line of cosmetics

95
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Little girl in

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Suburban Chicago

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
She remembers

98
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
How much you love watching her mom get ready to go out for the evening

99
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
My mother was

100
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
The most glamorous

101
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
Stunning woman she look

102
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
Like a young Jackie Kennedy

103
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,152
And I still watch her put her makeup on with her false eyelashes

104
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Her eyeliner

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
The skinniest could be should be

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Be standing there

107
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
With a cigarette hanging off of the counter

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
And I would just be sitting there watching her

109
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464
And she I watched everything I watched her take her Brown

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Pencil witch

111
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Now we know is Led

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
And fill in your eyebrows

113
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
And with a toothpick put on false eyelashes

114
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
And bronzer on her cheek

115
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Pale lip on

116
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,567
And go out you know with my dad Wednesday nights and Saturday nights

117
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
And I was in awe

118
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
You know I could never ever ever be that glamorous

119
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
And I was you know the shortest

120
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm always

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
And you know not

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
The skinniest

123
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
But I was really lucky

124
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
Because the other side of that I had my grandmother and my aunt Alice

125
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Who are more like me

126
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Really simple

127
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Comfortable shoes

128
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
You know people comfortable in their skin

129
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
And at the same time by the way

130
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,567
The beat the girls the models that were really popular

131
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Where is Cheryl Tiegs

132
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Oh yeah

133
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,711
And all these you know blond Barbie doll looking girls

134
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Which I was not one of them

135
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
I you know

136
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Thick eyebrows

137
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Dark hair

138
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
You know I wasn't that

139
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
And then

140
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
The thing that changed my life

141
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Was going to see the movie Love

142
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,167
Oh yes what's up with Ali MacGraw and I'll never forget I I I was somehow in middle I must

143
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
But in 7th grade

144
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
And I remember sitting there looking at this girl

145
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Dark shiny hair

146
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Parted down the middle

147
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
No apparent makeup

148
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
And literally

149
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
For the first time in my life I said

150
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
I could be pretty too

151
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
To change my life Ali MacGraw

152
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Change your life

153
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
Change my self-esteem and my

154
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
You know

155
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
My my confidence and

156
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Figuring out

157
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Who I am

158
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
So when you don't have time for you to

159
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Leave

160
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Home and go to college what did you would you say

161
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Well I I

162
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Went to

163
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
You know with a lot of my friends are probably a dozen of us

164
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
That went freshman year of

165
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
Of college to University of Arizona in Tucson

166
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
And I was

167
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Sober

168
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
That's cool you know because you would sit in it

169
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
It's a huge university

170
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
And you'd sit in these big giant halls with

171
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,279
500000 people and see this little teeny professor

172
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
At the end of lecture

173
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
With it on overhead projector

174
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,447
And I certainly it was not the way that I was

175
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
To learn so

176
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
And I went through the motions and the end of the year

177
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
I came home and I told my mom I wanted to drop out of school

178
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Animal says you can't

179
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
And I said but why Mom it's so boring I don't want to go to college she says

180
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
I never graduated

181
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
College inches you have to

182
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
I said Mom I have no clue what I want to do

183
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
My mother said

184
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Remember the two chairs we are sitting at

185
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
I was sitting cross-legged as I always do and she said

186
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
Okay forget what you want to do with your life

187
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,495
If today was your birthday you could do anything you want what would you want to do

188
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
I have no idea

189
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
And I remember as I always do quickly

190
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
Saying the first thing that popped into my head was

191
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
I want to go to Marshall Fields

192
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
And play with makeup

193
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
The big Marshall Fields

194
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,647
In downtown Chicago it actually in the suburbs cuz that's where I live but I wanted to go to the store and play with me

195
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
My mom said

196
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Why don't

197
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
You

198
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
You know why don't you study makeup

199
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,143
Justin Rochester why don't you study makeup and I said Mom

200
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
I want to go to Beauty School

201
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
And she said no I'm sure there's a

202
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
College

203
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Somewhere where you

204
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
You could study makeup

205
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
So I

206
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Actually

207
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
My Dad's friend tell me about the school embossed

208
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Skin called Emerson

209
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
That

210
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Will let me study makeup

211
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
This is the summer after

212
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
For your first year of college

213
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
Right that was literally two weeks

214
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Before I was supposed to go back to Arizona

215
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
And

216
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
My car was actually

217
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Yuno packed when I made

218
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
The decision to go to m

219
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
So was it was like it was like days before

220
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
I follow up with my dad

221
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Went to Emerson and and I asked

222
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
If they had to make a program they said no but we have something called

223
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
An interdisciplinary

224
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Reprogram

225
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
And you can create your own major

226
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Ensure you can study make

227
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
I said I'm in

228
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I'm going

229
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
And honestly when I got to Emerson

230
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
I found my

231
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
It was a school

232
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Full of kids like me

233
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Creative diary

234
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Entrepreneurial

235
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,655
And you're creating films and you're creating you know all different art projects

236
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
I remember even doing

237
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Films and you know they pair you with someone

238
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Instead of doing things a normal I would

239
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Which is like oh what kind of film should we do

240
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
I remember thinking about what kind of makeup I wanted

241
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
What to do in writing the film around the make

242
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
What was it about

243
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Makeup that you like to that spoke to

244
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Well it wasn't even just

245
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Makeup it was everything that goes along with

246
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
So I've always been someone

247
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
Dad knew how to use makeup

248
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Differently than other people did so

249
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
And doing theatrical makeup making someone look older like

250
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
It character

251
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,287
Was amazing for me because in order to do makeup for play

252
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
For a film you have to read the script

253
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Need to talk to the director

254
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
You have to create

255
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
What the

256
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,527
What the person is going to look like do they have a hard life

257
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,599
How do you make them look tired how do you make them look old

258
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
I have to go

259
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
Figure it out and understand it and then make the girls look like

260
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
So when you when you

261
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Finished

262
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
At Emerson

263
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,655
Did you was your intention to do theater

264
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Makeup yes

265
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
So I graduated

266
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Emerson and 79 and a month before I graduated I was in my bedroom reading

267
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
Mademoiselle Magazine and there was an article about a freelance makeup artist in New York named Bonnie Maller

268
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
And I never heard of a freelance make

269
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
Makeup artist and she was doing all the fashion shows and doing makeup work

270
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,351
Work for Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis and I wrote to her

271
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
And I said can I come to New York and assist

272
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
She never wrote me back

273
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
No no no no

274
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,151
She didn't want me back but I looked her up in the phone book and I called her

275
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
On her answering machine.

276
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
She said hi Bonnie if I am not getting back to you I'm probably on-location call my agent Bryan Bantry to one

277
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
To blah blah blah

278
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
So I go to New York for a visit and I call Bryan Bantry and he said come up and talk to me

279
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
And he explained to me how

280
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Freelance works

281
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
And I

282
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Started just figuring it out

283
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
So I'm

284
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
You know I moved to New York

285
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
And I didn't know anyone

286
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
Arrowhead Bryan Bantry had a meeting with him

287
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
And he started to know slowly calling me

288
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
App to be an assistant

289
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
To some of his

290
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
People he didn't represent me but he let me be honest

291
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
So you

292
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
You get to New York and and you decide that you want to be

293
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
Makeup artists in that this was going to your life like

294
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
So how did you

295
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
How do you start a good job

296
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,727
Well I actually thought I would do fashion on the side until I broke into TV

297
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
So one of the things I did

298
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
There's another make of ours her name was Bobby

299
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
And she was the Mega bars for Saturday Night Live

300
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
I assisted her a few times

301
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,087
So you know that was cool and I remember doing a couple times you knows

302
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,439
The makeup artist on the Evening News couldn't make it I would do that so

303
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
You know it was a I started a freelance career

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
The only way

305
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
I paid my rent

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
At that time

307
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Where's my dad

308
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Gave me

309
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
$500 a month

310
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
To pay my rent

311
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
And in what

312
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
I got this time

313
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
In your life did you feel like

314
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,991
There were expectations that you aren't fulfilling I don't know I mean

315
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Chart of middle-class home in Chicagoland

316
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
Your dad was a lawyer and and so

317
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Do you ever thinking like

318
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Oh man

319
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
And you know like my parents having sex

320
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Locations of me in and I need to

321
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
I don't know I mean would you ever

322
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
I was thinking like that or worried about you

323
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Can I tell you why one I have this

324
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Really weird gif

325
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
You know you don't know what's a gift until you're you know of a certain age and look back

326
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
I am so naive

327
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,175
So I never think something's not going to work out and I never did

328
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Dead so

329
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
I was not worried

330
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Yes I was always anxious about how I was going to

331
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
Pay the rent or if I had enough money for this

332
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
And might I remember calling my dad one day and I said Dad

333
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,815
I just can't stick to this budget I had a credit card with a limit I think I had $250 a month limit

334
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
And I kept

335
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,959
She don't crying all these fees and I said that I can't stick to this and it's alright stop for me

336
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Put it down

337
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
I said okay

338
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
He said stop trying to

339
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
To stick to a budget

340
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Or create a budget

341
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Why don't you figure out how you're going to make more money

342
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
I said

343
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Okay

344
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
And I remember telling myself

345
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Monday morning you get up

346
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Can you fill your day book with

347
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
So I go see

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
She's as they call it so

349
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
I went I started make an appointment

350
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
And as long as I

351
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Monday was my day to

352
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
Fill it and then I had the whole week to go see

353
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
People so I started calling

354
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,519
Magazines and I'd look on the Masthead and I would see the booking age

355
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
I booked with them

356
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
I am Bobby Brown I'm a freelance makeup artist

357
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
I love

358
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
To come in and show you my book

359
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
I had a you know a book I like faces that you know faces that I've done

360
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
Yes and you start to make

361
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
Relationships you come back and see

362
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
See people and I did that for a while

363
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
So here's my question

364
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
I mean what does it

365
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
The cow are you

366
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Good like a better makeup artist than someone else

367
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
What is it that

368
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
You were able to offer

369
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Well alright so let's go back to

370
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
The 70s and the 80s

371
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
The makeup

372
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Back then

373
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Was

374
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Is the epitome of a natural

375
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Foundation with pink

376
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
It stopped at the

377
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
At the jawline

378
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
It was Contour eyes were eyeshadow was

379
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Yellow

380
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Purple and blue

381
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
It was all of those

382
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
I was always doing

383
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
More of a now it's called a Bobby

384
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
Face and now it's called nude makeup but back then

385
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
It was just

386
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
I always made people look

387
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Healthier

388
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,263
I wanted people to not look like they're wearing makeup and

389
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
I even had one

390
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,407
Very very famous makeup artists you know who I asked his opinion on stuff said

391
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
You will never work

392
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Because

393
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
People don't want to look like that

394
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
Can I don't want to look like that people want to look

395
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Made up and

396
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Do you know I just

397
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Couldn't do it so even when I was doing makeup

398
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
On TV

399
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,583
I had these really simple things I I looked for

400
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
I wanted to make the foundation

401
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
To actually be the color of the skin yeah

402
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
You know I had a mix and blend

403
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
Because most makeup on the market was bad

404
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
And you know having a giant

405
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Kit I had everything

406
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Thanks so I would

407
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Can I get a smash a lot of it together

408
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Then people started taking pictures of it

409
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Look really good

410
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
So

411
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Do

412
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Are getting steady work

413
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
More magazine who was the first

414
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Really big gig

415
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,303
That you can remember getting like a with a major fashion model

416
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Probably

417
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Two of my

418
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Youjizz

419
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
Haha like back then was

420
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
When I had

421
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
Six or eight page spread in American Vogue

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
With

423
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
1 model Tatiana

424
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
Petites and it was literally

425
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Full

426
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,271
Face full-bleed full face of makeup story

427
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Only on you know different looks different makeup that was like

428
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Put me on the map

429
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
And then the next map was

430
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
A cover of Vogue with Naomi Campbell

431
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Wow when was that

432
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
Now we're into I think

433
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
88 or 89

434
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
When she was just starting to be a huge huge deal

435
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
So

436
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
You know you are doing makeup and that's your life at your career

437
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
I was at the top of my game and by the way

438
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,455
You do magazine work in editorial it's fantastic you

439
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
No matter how big it is

440
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Do you still get a hundred

441
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,367
$50 a day so you really don't make a whole lot of money no but

442
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
When you do advertising

443
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
And catalog like catalog at the time was paying

444
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
Between 250 and 500 a day and that's when you do makeup

445
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,935
On a bunch of models for a Saks Fifth Avenue or a Macy's and then if it

446
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
It's a commercial you got a couple thousand

447
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
But everything you do you mean

448
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,871
People and youstina you tend to move in packs if a hairdresser gets

449
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Look for something they book you and then

450
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
You know then you start doing advertising and that's

451
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
You know

452
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Be up to 5000 a day

453
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
And by the way while I did those things I also had

454
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
A very very serious relationship

455
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
I got engaged

456
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
I moved out of the city

457
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
I had friends

458
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
I had a normal life

459
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
I started having kids

460
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
The same time

461
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
And I chose that

462
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
I chose that

463
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
I wanted to be

464
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
I wanted to go through that tunnel

465
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Put my hair in a ponytail put my sneakers on

466
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Be in the park with my dog

467
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
You know I'd rather be home with my

468
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Husband in my baby then you know

469
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
State

470
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
I can understand why they wanted me to stay at a fashion shoot

471
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Until 10:00

472
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Just because they took a long time

473
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Deciding thing

474
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
I'm out of here

475
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Yeah

476
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
Show in 1990

477
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
I guess that was

478
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Around the time with you

479
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
Started to kind of

480
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Explain with your own makeup

481
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Even happen

482
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
So

483
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
I was pregnant with my first baby

484
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
And I was on

485
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
A photoshoot for Mademoiselle magazine

486
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Self mag

487
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
And it was called makeup shopping

488
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
At alternative places with makeup artist Bobbi Brown

489
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
And they took me to different places in one of the place

490
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Is downtown I guess I took them

491
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
Did I took the crew 2 with kills Farm

492
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,847
Kiehl's at the time was this independently owned cool place

493
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
I brought everyone down the rear shooting there and while they were shooting

494
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
I was talking to the chemist

495
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
That was there and he had a little a couple lipsticks and on my Fork

496
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Kiehl's

497
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
Chopshop Family Pharmacy last

498
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Exactly

499
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
And it was a chemist on site

500
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
There was a chemist on site

501
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,983
And he had these lipsticks and I remember touching them

502
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,311
And I said wow these are really nice he's how I make those

503
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
And I said you make them

504
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Yeah I said

505
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Oh I thought I would love to

506
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
To be able to

507
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
To make a lips

508
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
He said I'll make it for

509
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Are you I said

510
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
I said what I want

511
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
You can't buy it said I want something that doesn't smell

512
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
I wanted to be

513
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Creamy but not greasy I want it to

514
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Look like lips

515
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
I can't find a Lipstick Alley

516
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Looks like lip color and he's like what do you mean

517
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
I said well and I pulled out my taupe

518
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
I pencil in my

519
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
Pinky blush and I said look at when you put this together

520
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
You put a little bit of bomb on it

521
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
And blotted on your lips he's like Alright give me those

522
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
Anyone home and he sent it to me

523
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
And I said oh my God I love this

524
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
I said I bet I could sell this

525
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
And he said all right

526
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Why don't you sell it for

527
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
$15

528
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
He said I'll make it you sell it

529
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
You'll get 750 I'll get 7

530
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Okay that's a deal

531
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
So I had a lipstick

532
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
That I called Brown

533
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
Cuz I thought it was brown base not cuz of my name

534
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
And then I said everyone's going to love that

535
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
And I said you know what not everyone has

536
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
The same color lips

537
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
And I started studying

538
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
People's lip color

539
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,503
And then I sat down and I thought about all the different lip colors

540
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,855
And then I said you know some people don't like lip color lipstick they like red

541
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Orange

542
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,439
Someone likes a good beige

543
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Pink

544
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
But I said

545
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
You don't need 15 different pinks in your makeup kit

546
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Let me make the ideal pink

547
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Let me make the ideal Orange

548
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
So I sat down and I thought of 10 different colors

549
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
I work for the chemist

550
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
He made these colors

551
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
And I thought all right let's put a number 1 to 10

552
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Let me name them

553
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
I was going to name the way lipsticks are named

554
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Do you know cherries in the snow and

555
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
I'm like why don't we call them

556
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Beige

557
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Pink

558
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Orange

559
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Red

560
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
So in a raisin

561
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
I named them what they look like

562
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
So you are doing like more understated

563
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Yes I understand

564
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
And what was on the market

565
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Wearable by the way

566
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
The word wearable

567
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
People could put them on and actually look good

568
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
How's that for a concept

569
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
You would take like

570
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
To to get the right color

571
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
What was the name of the

572
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
By the way

573
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Steven Steven

574
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Steven

575
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
The right color you would take like

576
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
I don't know

577
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
Paint or or different make ups and just like rubbing together like a

578
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
Petri dish recipe I would either mail it to him or I would say.

579
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Do this and

580
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
Yeah you know back and forth back and forth

581
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
She made them for me and I did everything

582
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
And we said yeah make like how many

583
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Like 5-10 sticks

584
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
I think you know he probably made

585
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
100 of each color

586
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,104
Yasso know once we agreed that we would be paw

587
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
Where is there was nothing in writing it was just while this could be interesting

588
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Sting

589
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
It wasn't anything more than

590
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
And he had like a fabrication

591
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Plantar visibility like

592
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
Make moldings around did I don't I think he did it in his home

593
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
You know it wasn't it was his side thing

594
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Because he was a chemist

595
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
And what were you going to sell each to Calypso

596
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
Oregon $15 fifteen bucks

597
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
15 bucks

598
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
And

599
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
When I first started my plan was to

600
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
To sell them tomatoes

601
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Editor's

602
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:08,128
And then one day I was having lunch with a girlfriend who was the beauty editor of Glamour magazine

603
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
At the time

604
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
It's a what's going on

605
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
You know we both had young babies and I talking about the kids and I said

606
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
You know I'm doing let me show you this thing

607
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Oh my God

608
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
That's so cool she said can I write about

609
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,744
And you had the kind of a reputation in the industry

610
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Because you were

611
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
Eye makeup artist

612
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
You get this article and Glamour and what

613
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
People started calling up an ordering lips

614
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Wind

615
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
You know it wasn't like oh my God I'm going to be rich oh my God I could

616
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Pay my mortgage

617
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
This month

618
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
It was just you know

619
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,992
Steady things coming in and we got a bunch offers

620
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
You know people wanted

621
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Purchase lips

622
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
EXO

623
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
I don't even think

624
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Cannot whistle

625
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
400

626
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
Finally sold a bunch of

627
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Does not call Bobby Brown

628
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Yes it was it was

629
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Is it was called Bobby Brown I don't know what else

630
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,376
The calling you just put your name on the side yes

631
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
And that was really cool

632
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
And then I meet the lady at Bergdorf

633
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
And that's when things

634
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Actually

635
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Needed

636
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Change you mean

637
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Whoever.

638
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
I ended up going to a

639
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Party in the city with some friends

640
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
And

641
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,344
Friends that actually eventually we're going to be our partners

642
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
In the company

643
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
And I met her friend Allison and I said thanks for inviting me on Bobby

644
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,048
She's a nice to meet you and I

645
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
Said what are you doing she said on the Cosmetics buyer at Bergdorf

646
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Wow that's nice

647
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
But I never even shopped at Bergdorf Goodman

648
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
And I said wow

649
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,312
I'm doing this line of lipsticks

650
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
You know perhaps you want to look at them

651
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
And she said love to let me bring him in

652
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,016
So what happened you went you brought your look 6 to 2

653
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
To show her then a couple days later

654
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
She brought them in I mean I had no

655
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Press release I had nothing

656
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,512
She called me back and she said they're really interested we love to take them

657
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
That's when

658
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
I realize

659
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,936
I hadn't really changed the way we were doing things

660
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,592
And you know I had to find a different way to scale up in the chemist because that was the only way he knew

661
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
So I parted ways with the chemist

662
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
And I had to find

663
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
A lab

664
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
To recreate the lipsticks

665
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
The way I want it

666
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
And we needed to find someone to

667
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
To do what I remember making all these calls

668
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
But then one day

669
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
I was in an elevator

670
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
And I said hi to the girl in the elevator and she said hi I think we're on the 11th floor so we had a few minutes elevator in your apart

671
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,776

673
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
The high and I said what are you do

674
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
She said I work at at

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152

678
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
And I said oh

679
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Do you have a card

680
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
And

681
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
I

682
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
Had my lipsticks

683
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
I recreated there and they made my lipsticks

684
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
I met her in the elevator

685
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,168

00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208

Bergdorf Goodman

729
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
We

To part with

739

Did not have the expertise

741
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176

00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,376
I've been in the Cosmetics industry

750
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
And she was in PR

751
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
So it was you no a magical pairing

752
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
That's how we started the branch

753
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
And Bobby Brown is born as a

754
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
Product at Bergdorf Goodman

755
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
Yes and how does it do when it debuts there

756
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
Well we thought we would sell 100 lipstick

757
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
The first month

758
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Which

759
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:13,696
You know that was the thought and we did a hundred the first day and were you in in the store we were we had.

760
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,256
On 5th Avenue and there was no room in the

761
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Cosmetics Department

762
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
So they put us on a

763
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Table

764
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Outside of

765
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
The cosmetics

766
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
Department where I think they had you know handbags

767
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,032
And so you know he wasn't for any other reason

768
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,872
The people thought it was a brilliant genius idea that we marketed ourselves

769
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Apart

770
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
From the noise of the cosmos

771
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Floor

772
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,528
So you could Finance it with whatever cash you had

773
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Write a review and then

774
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
And then you would sell product and then you

775
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
You will get paid by Bergdorf Goodman when they go to the next

776
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
App Store

777
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,304
While we were at Burgerville we we added pencils

778
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
And then we added eyeshadow like we did everything not

779
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
Lake strategic

780
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
But as they came up and we

781
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
We added them and we were pretty much with the

782
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,824
The same lab for most of the time

783
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
And then Bergdorf

784
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
You know one day we are doing so well at Bergdorf Goodman

785
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,272
They said you know where sister company of Neiman Marcus

786
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Stay with love

787
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
To try you in for stores

788
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,160
So we open up for stores and Neiman's stores

789
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
Counter right counter yeah they call them doors actually

790
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Play 3 open for doors for stores

791
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,912
Started adding you know products and I would visit the stores and do personal appearances

792
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,288
Usually with my husband and my baby or babies you know in toe cuz we always

793
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,640
You know I never liked to be apart from them and they always came

794
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
And I would travel to these Market

795
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,784
And I would be on their local TV I be on in their newspaper

796
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
So it was a full-on you know Preston

797
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
Did you ever get a by for people like

798
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Who are you

799
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
I'm certain

800
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
You know an especially in Dallas you know where they would look

801
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Look at me like

802
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,424
She's the Plain Jane type now cuz in Dallas that make up the hair the generator

803
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
You know it took a while to Geneva Marcus

804
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Natural demons

805
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,848
Took awhile to be beloved by those women

806
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
But also at the same time

807
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
I was B

808
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Becoming

809
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
Unknown

810
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Beauty expert on The Today Show

811
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Which

812
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Was really a major launch

813
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
In the

814
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
The brand and The Business

815
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,976
So the story behind the

816
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
The Today Show was that I wrote my first book

817
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
About about

818
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Cosmetics by makeup

819
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,448
Yeah and then I was having to be in Florida doing a personal appearance

820
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
It's for one of my

821
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,384
Makeup products and also for my first book and I'll never forget it was in you know the Inner Circle

822
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,224
Which were the fancy ladies at Neiman Marcus I finished my speech

823
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
And I said any question

824
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
And the little

825
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
Red headed lady in a grandma type

826
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Raise your hand and I went back

827
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
You remember I put my hand on her shoulder she was so cute

828
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
And she said yes I have trouble keeping my lipstick on

829
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
How do I do it and I said well

830
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
And I gave her the answer

831
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:05,472
And she looked at me and she just thinking she said are you Jewish I said

832
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Yes I am

833
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
And she said

834
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
I've seen you on the Today Show I've been on once I said thank you

835
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,688
And she said as a Jewish this is off microphone

836
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,272
She said you've done so much is there anything else you want to do

837
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
I said I don't know I said

838
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
I don't know maybe I'd love to be a regular on The Today Show

839
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
She said honey

840
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Jeff zucker's my grandson

841
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
Deathstalker was executive producer of The Today Show at the time

842
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Mike and

843
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,216
It was a Friday Monday I was on the Today show I was in my dress

844
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
You know my PR team at the time was beyond excited doing

845
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,640
How to put your makeup on something probably Katie was interviewing

846
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
Jeff came up and he said Grammy

847
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,296
You know wanted me to have you on I said that's awesome and he said

848
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
I hear you want to be irregular

849
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
I said I'd love to be irregular

850
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Is okay your regular

851
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
I said when when can I come back

852
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,584
He said how about next month I said okay once a month is it okay fine

853
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,400
I was on The Today Show for about

854
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
12 years 15 years

855
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
And honestly being a beauty expert on The Today Show

856
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,312
Probably

857
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Put me on the map

858
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
And you did this for free

859
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,968
I know I never never paid me a nickel

860
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,832
And I never ever push my brand they would say Bobby Brown from Bobby Brown cosmetics

861
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
And so it was an amazing thing.

862
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
Because it established me as a beauty expert not just someone

863
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Who makes

864
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Makeup it was really my expertise

865
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
So it's separated me the

866
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
Person

867
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,216
From the brand which was good but it also really

868
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
Helped the brand

869
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,824
Yuan in 1995

870
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
5 years after you first make those 10

871
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Lipsticks you can offer

872
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
I guess you

873
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
Shirley on you guys are

874
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Approached by

875
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Big the big cosmetic

876
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,672
Who wanted to buy your

877
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
Brand and you guess you reject a couple offers

878
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,888
There was a lot of talks with shado

879
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
The Japanese company has a lot of meanings lot of talks

880
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,008
No official offer but a lot of me

881
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
And then there was a

882
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
A dallas-based

883
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,480
Company that tried to buy us a finance company that basically finally said

884
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
If you want sell to us we're just going to knock you off

885
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
With another makeup artist which they did

886
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
Which is fine I'm never afraid of that

887
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
Only creason knock-off brands

888
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,304
Well it was a different brand but yes a makeup artist

889
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
You know of a well-known makeup artist

890
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
The Creator

891
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Products

892
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
It is still out there

893
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Laura Mercier

894
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,288
You know it was a competitor I mean we were very we were always very

895
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
That was fun

896
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
And they wanted to kind of

897
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Buy you out in

898
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,992
Who did they wanted to buy if we weren't for sale we didn't think they were the right people to buy it

899
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
We want for sale when

900
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
You know we got the call from Estee Lauder either

901
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,464
This is five years after you launch at Estee Lauder calls you

902
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
And you take the call

903
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
I kind of think it was for years but yes for years it was 4 years so I got a call from Frederic Fekkai

904
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,312
Who you know how to salon and was a well-known hairdresser and he said you know Leonard Lauder would like an introduction to

905
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Can I do that

906
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
And I said sure

907
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Sure

908
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
So we were invited have dinner

909
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,040
Leonard lauder's home my partner Roz and I

910
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
We're invited one night

911
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
To his home and

912
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Tim and his wife at the time Evelyn we had a beautiful dinner

913
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
And you know fell madly in love

914
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
You know with him with her

915
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
And he basically said

916
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
You know I'm really interested in buying your company you've done

917
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
He said what he said to me says

918
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,128
You've done such an incredible job you are beating us

919
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
In the stores and we were beating Estee Lauder in Neiman Marcus

920
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Set the time

921
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
You are feeding us

922
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
We can't beat you

923
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
So we thought we would buy you

924
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
You were open to hearing hearing offers

925
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Moen Leonard said

926
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,048
You know that we can help you grow your business and you could do what you really love

927
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Which is

928
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
Be creative and work on schuetz work

929
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,216
On the grand but not have to worry about the details

930
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
And we could help expand your business

931
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
And you can have complete autonomy

932
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
You know which means I could do what

933
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
I wanted with

934
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
The company and still being charged

935
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,040
And they were they were offering 100% they're going to buy out of a hundred percent

936
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
104

937
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
End

938
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,672
I guess we'll just burst about whether you did sell to them we get

939
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
We did it no one's ever gotten the number right and I'm not good at numbers and I can't even

940
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
And tell you what it is but it was like

941
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
More than I could ever have them it was a lot of cash

942
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
Yes negative course split

943
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
What's your partner's and then pay your taxes

944
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Just be you were left with a

945
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
The more cash if you ever had

946
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Yes

947
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
All right

948
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Just paws

949
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
Looking back on that decision 1995

950
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Two celled Estee Lauder

951
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
For whatever price average

952
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Do some people say

953
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
74 million with a 50 ml

954
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Was it the right decision to make

955
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
100

956
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
It was the right decision 100%

957
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,584
You couldn't have scaled Bobby Brown to what it is today without that

958
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
I don't know

959
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
But I didn't want

960
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
Because because I

961
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
Just wanted

962
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
To have

963
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,080
Fulfilling life with my family my friend

964
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Am I kids

965
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
There's no question I have no regrets

966
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Becoming a billionaire wasn't

967
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Wasn't that

968
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
That was my goal

969
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,344
No millionaire is fine we don't need to go to

970
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
Alright so Leonard Lauder

971
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Write you a big check

972
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,608
And Estee Lauder now owns Bobbi Brown what does that mean does that mean that you then become an employee of an employer

973
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,704
Yep they paid you a salary you weren't a boy with a 401k and all that stuff

974
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
At the beginning was it

975
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Did you like it

976
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
I loved it it was fantastic I loved it for you know out of the 22 years I probably loved it

977
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
415

978
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,832
And so the idea was once Estee Lauder was running the business side

979
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
You not to worry about going to

980
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Banks

981
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,232
Financing you don't have to worry about Supply change enough to worry about

982
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
Payroll accounting or

983
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
Not filing a letter with the office

984
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Tax and Revenue

985
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
And you didn't want to do any of that

986
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,008
I didn't like the big corporate meetings and I would sit there and some meetings

987
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
And I know I used to drive people crazy

988
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Because I didn't do things the Corporate Way

989
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,712
And I'm sure people either looked at me as

990
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Brilliant

991
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
Or really difficult

992
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
Or

993
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
You know whatever

994
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
You know the thing is

995
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Unfortunately

996
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
Men could be brilliant when women are considered

997
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
I can imagine

998
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
That would have been an easy transition

999
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:00,448
It wasn't easy and I'm sure it was harder for you know our partners at the time

1000
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
They didn't stay very long

1001
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
You know we we had a

1002
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
Little bit of a tough

1003
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
Relationship

1004
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
You know for a while

1005
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Because you know you

1006
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,016
Start a company with friends

1007
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
You know things happen

1008
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
And things get tough

1009
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
And

1010
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
It was a tough time

1011
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,488
There was a bunch of years were think there was a struggle but

1012
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Between

1013
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,072
You know Rosin Eye and then the four of us

1014
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,936
You know after you know we sold the company they

1015
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,288
Remove rods off the brand and

1016
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
She ended up

1017
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,432
Working for the company for a while and then she left and a stranger French

1018
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Oh really stranded

1019
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
Do you think that it's a good idea

1020
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
In general to avoid going to business

1021
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Best friends

1022
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Yes

1023
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,512
It's not a good hundred percent and you know we

1024
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:02,144
We're not friends for many years after we sold the company and we just recently got back together the path

1025
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Couple years

1026
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
So

1027
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
You know life isn't

1028
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
You walked away

1029
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
From Estee Lauder on 26th

1030
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
At the right track

1031
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
I don't even know what the right term

1032
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
As it was it was a joint

1033
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
And was that hard

1034
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,320
Your name your company

1035
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
You built it

1036
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
And that you're out

1037
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Well

1038
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,000
Play probably 2 to 5 years 5 years was

1039
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
The last five years the last five years was

1040
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:36,704
Struggle just because just because another it got so big the company got so big

1041
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
The corporation gots

1042
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
So big they bought so many other companies

1043
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
It was growing it was huge

1044
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,896
I am not a follow the leader

1045
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
I am the leader okay I can't

1046
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,784
And if I see things not working

1047
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,368
What makes sense to me and wasting energy and time

1048
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
I don't like it and I liked it

1049
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Do it different

1050
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,048
You know and I like to try new things and invent new things

1051
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
So yeah it was always

1052
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Always ask

1053
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
And so then the last couple years were really tough

1054
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Mike what happened

1055
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
Oh my god there was just

1056
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,616
You know they starting I used to hire ever approve and hire an interview every person

1057
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
And then I didn't any

1058
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
And all of a sudden they were people

1059
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Working

1060
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
On my brand that I never met

1061
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
4

1062
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,368
And then I might not have hired

1063
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,208
And you know it was a struggle and I tried to let go of

1064
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
The details

1065
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,328
Then I realized the details what makes the company so

1066
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,424
And so I kept thinking I could fix it

1067
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
So I would walk in every day with

1068
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
An imaginary you know

1069
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Taper on my arms thing

1070
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Okay let me fix

1071
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Let me see

1072
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Let me fix

1073
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
I couldn't

1074
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,432
And you know

1075
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
It the last year was really tough

1076
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,832
I'm sure they were not happy with me I was not happy with them

1077
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
And it just was time for both of us

1078
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
To move on

1079
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,280
Was it tough in the sense like you dreaded going into the office in the morning

1080
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Yes wow now only dreaded going in in the morning

1081
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
I was

1082
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Depleted

1083
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
And spent

1084
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
When I came home so

1085
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,568
For two years my Aunt Alice who when I was 18 at the time

1086
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
I would say to me

1087
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
It's time

1088
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
My husband say

1089
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Are you ready

1090
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Like my friends would say

1091
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Enough is enough

1092
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,832
And I kept saying no cuz I think if we could just do this

1093
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
If I could get this

1094
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
You know it could be better

1095
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
And it didn't

1096
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Get better

1097
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
I feel like I'm imagining I'm walking down

1098
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
Some Street New York

1099
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,400
I passed you and I know it's Bobby Brown I like

1100
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,448
Oh my God Bobby Brown I love your makeup

1101
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
And you're on your way to work and you

1102
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
You would say oh yeah

1103
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
Thank you so much and I wouldn't know that you

1104
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
You were miserable now

1105
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,895
Walking to your powerful job at Bobby

1106
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
Honestly if you really ask me why I left

1107
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
I needed

1108
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
To be the boss of

1109
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
Yeah like when you're the boss and your case something doesn't work week

1110
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
So yes

1111
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
When I left Bobby it wasn't easy

1112
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
The second it happened where I went down the elevator

1113
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,071
And I knew that was that second it was done

1114
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
I had a relief come over me

1115
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,191
Like I can't tell you this first relief was

1116
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Oh my God

1117
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
All these problems are lifted

1118
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
All right

1119
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
We had

1120
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Lots of

1121
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
Founders of the company who sold

1122
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
And then you know

1123
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Some

1124
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Some were angry with away was Ron and

1125
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,367
And some of mixed feelings someday

1126
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
But

1127
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
You know Ben and Jerry for exam

1128
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Those guys

1129
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,047
Bill Bill knock Ben & Jerry's now and again of the good-natured way but they will

1130
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,375
Still there still the face of the brand and they're happy to kind of be the

1131
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Brett not happy but they are the brand ambassador

1132
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Did you ever think of doing that

1133
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
No no no interest that you would have it was offered

1134
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
Like the Bobby Brown I mean

1135
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Space of the

1136
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
You didn't had no winter

1137
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
No

1138
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,527
I don't care how much money they offered me. Why

1139
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Why not

1140
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
What I love I'm a man

1141
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
I'd like

1142
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
To to mold and shape

1143
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
And being control

1144
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Apostle

1145
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
Are so now I have

1146
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
No I had no

1147
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
You know honestly it's been awhile it's

1148
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
I'm not going to say I walked out the door and it was

1149
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
Was fine there was a lot of emotion the first

1150
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Month or two there was a lot of emotion

1151
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,127
You know the first year now it's

1152
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
Juno year-and-a-half

1153
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
I literally

1154
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Could look

1155
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:37,855
At what's happening there and I and I unfollowed everything so I don't see anything but when I do see it

1156
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,695
It's like there's nothing there because it's not the company I

1157
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,255
I found it and it's not the company that

1158
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,815
That is not my company is there company

1159
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
And yes I'm really proud

1160
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,447
Of the products I'm proud of everything I did

1161
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,543
But you know the world is changed and what they're the direction they're going is

1162
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
It's fine is what they want to do

1163
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
I mean you're still here

1164
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Young woman

1165
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,991
Well if you consider 61 young Rd

1166
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
People start businesses 1/6

1167
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,207
By the way were you were you prevented are you prevented from your contractor Bobby Brown of starting a makeup line

1168
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Oh yes

1169
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,047
Never be alone for the rest of your life

1170
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
No that's not accurate

1171
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
But I my name I sold my name

1172
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
2

1173
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
You can't you can't use the name Bobby Brown

1174
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
But I would never

1175
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
Yeah I wouldn't I would never put

1176
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,383
Even if I could I would not put my name on a product anymore

1177
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Because I have to be the face of that product

1178
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
I don't want to be responsible

1179
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
You are everything

1180
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
I did that already

1181
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
To Bobby

1182
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
With all this

1183
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
The success you had in your career

1184
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,207
How much of it do you think is because of your

1185
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
Your intelligence your hard work and how much of it

1186
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Because of lack

1187
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
I think that

1188
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,191
My intelligence is mostly emotional intelligence which is do you know

1189
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Dealing with what's around me

1190
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
I am

1191
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
Credibly lucky and

1192
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
You know

1193
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Fortuitous

1194
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
And grateful and all those things

1195
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:11,039
I'm not the only one that works hard I am not the only one that sees his upper

1196
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Opportunities

1197
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
I

1198
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Don't know why

1199
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,975
You know things I do are successful not everything I've done is successful but

1200
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Keep going

1201
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,143
And I'm really good when I'm really good at and I hope there's other entrepreneurs out there that understand this

1202
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,983
I am really good at hiring people that are good at things that I'm not

1203
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
That's really

1204
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,919
Cuz I'm not good at everything and I'm not I told my Aunt Alice I'm not really good at anything I'm just good at telling people what to do

1205
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
I'm really good at telling people what to do

1206
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,111
Bobbi Brown founder of Bobbi Brown cosmetics

1207
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,695
Since leaving the company she started the health and wellness brand

1208
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Called evolution

1209
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
18

1210
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
She's also running a boutique hotel called the

1212
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Montclair New Jersey

1213
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,911
And even though she sold the name Bobby Brown

1214
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,239
She was able to start a new brand called just Bobby

1215
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
Sell things like

1216
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
Clothing and bags

1217
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,407
Lucky for you to have such a cool name Bobby

1218
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:13,503
I never liked my name growing up you hated it

1219
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,903
When they decided what to name and I was named after my great-grandmother Bertha thank God that it

1220
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Berta

1221
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:26,815
Not sure anyone would use lipstick called Berta brown or you could just that I could be your new

1222
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
No you know what maybe maybe it's time

1223
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Berta I'm not sure that would work

1224
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,455
And please do stick around because in just a moment

1225
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,271
We're going to hear from you about the things your building

1226
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,831
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors

1227
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Microsoft Surface

1228
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,415
Introducing the new Surface go

1229
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
The smallest Microsoft Surface ever

1230
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
Just over one pound as a

1231
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
10 inch screen

1232
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,607
The new Surface go has

1233
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Performance of a laptop

1234
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
But with the portability

1235
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Tablet

1236
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,823
Hey thanks for sticking around because

1237
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
I know for how you built that

1238
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,967
Is it a story starts about three years ago in Los Angeles

1239
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Guy names

1240
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,087
Miles pepper I went to my local coffee shop to grab an iced latte

1241
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Before heading off to work

1242
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
And as I was leaving the shop I

1243
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,791
Put a plastic straw my drink as normal habit but as it happens just the night before

1244
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:34,143
Miles Encina program about Plastics that are polluting the ocean

1245
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:39,007
I had just seen the video of the sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nose and

1246
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,847
I was thinking to myself that I already have a reusable water bottle

1247
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
I already have

1248
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Reusable coffee cup

1249
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
Why don't I have a reusable straw

1250
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:53,087
Yeah a reusable strata not made out of plastic but maybe metal

1251
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
A straw that could fold and collapse

1252
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:00,255
Like a temple and a way to guarantee that it would always be

1253
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
On me would be if it was a size of a

1254
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
The car key

1255
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,399
So I wanted a collapsible straw that was small enough to

1256
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
To fit in case

1257
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
The size of a car key

1258
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:14,335
Unfortunately I didn't know the first thing about how to make a collapsible straw

1259
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,967
So I started talking with friends I started talking with these designers that I have been working with

1260
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:25,855
This mutual friend said hey you should call Emma do you remember to Emma miles did remember Emma

1261
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
She was an acquaintance who also hated plastic straws

1262
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
Even though a text talk about it

1263
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
Straw suck

1264
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,095
We become accustomed to living disposable lifestyles

1265
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Besan convenia

1266
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,703
So a man died and jumped on the phone

1267
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,055
Phone rings October 2017 and he says

1268
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,127
Hey I've got this idea for a collapsible

1269
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Straw

1270
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
And I just remember he first

1271
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,575
Sounded really excited on the phone and it got me really excited

1272
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
So anyway miles found in industrial designer in LA to help him develop a collapsible stainless steel

1273
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:09,375
Steel straw and while they were working on the design I was working on creating a social media press

1274
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
I have a love

1275
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,007
Love memes and one of my favorite ones was filling a

1276
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:19,103
Pack of cigarettes with straws and at the bottom it says break the habit

1277
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
After about a month and a half

1278
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,711
Emma Myles had a prototype of a straw that

1279
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Fold into

1280
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Sports

1281
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,087
Fits into a little plastic case that you would carry on a keychain

1282
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Annexed

1283
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
A Kickstarter campaign

1284
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:36,511
And the pickle was 5,000 straws which would have been about $70,000

1285
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,327
But we sold about 60 thousand straws

1286
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,935
Closed a month later with 1.89 million dollars in the bank

1287
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,311
Which sounds amazing right except discovered a really big problem

1288
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,175
There's companies out there that are patrolling Kickstarter and looking to see

1289
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,807
When people throw a successful campaign and as soon as they see that overnight success

1290
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
Then they jump on it

1291
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
And they use the measurements that are provided on the kickstarter to create an exact replica of that

1292
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
And that

1293
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,839
Is exactly what happened to Emma in miles

1294
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
These random sharks basically hijacked their idea made some quick cheap knockoffs and started fulfilling

1295
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,847
Orders before Eminem I could even get their straws out into the world

1296
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,895
I mean it's shocking

1297
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
The hardest part for her

1298
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Is the fact that

1299
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Most of these knock-offs are complete

1300
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Junk and so they're just ending up in the trash can and the entire purpose of our company

1301
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
To reduce waste

1302
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,607
And so I feel weirdly responsible you know no matter how many people tell me that it's not my fault

1303
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
Like it's still

1304
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,031
Feels like it is but I'm on miles are still moving head to apply for a patent and the color product

1305
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
Final straw

1306
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,919
And they say it'll be a lot better than the knock-offs

1307
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,015
And that's something that people are going to love it was expecting to

1308
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:07,135
Build the kickstarter orders sometime this November and she says this past year

1309
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:11,231
Been a little like business school except on speed

1310
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,047
No it's like going down a river in a

1311
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,887
Tube like you just don't know what to expect and every moment is either like

1312
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Very Serene and calm or you're

1313
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Maybe going to die and I love it

1314
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,079
