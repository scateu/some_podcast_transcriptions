12
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
Originally planned to make

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
Educational videos

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
For kids

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
But when that plan

16
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Didn't quite work out

17
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
They decided to shift

18
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Toys

00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000

December 2

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
Basically what happened is when we called the

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
Let's can I send you some more no it's not selling and we

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
We would always say but you're not selling it with me to take note it's not selling and this happened

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
Time and time again and then after about 2 months it was like this stuff is taking up too much space I wanted out of my

27
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind

28
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648

Video game or app

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay so

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,448
If you have a small child in your life may be a niece or nephew or a grandchild

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Pick your own tree

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
At some point

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
You will find yourself in a toys

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Store and you will be

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Frantic

39
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Looking for a new Trans

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
You might

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Stumble on toys made by Melissa & Doug Burns

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Sirtoys

46
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
I do not have to be plugged in or

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Or charge

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Upgraded with a lathe

49
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Software

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
A simple old fashioned toys wooden blocks

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Puzzles and

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Easels

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
And the company which is

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
Actually called Melissa & Doug

55
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Was created

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
When Melissa & Doug Bernstein we're still dating

57
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Back in 90

58
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
88

59
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
And the way they met

60
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
They were actually introduced by their parents

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
What's it like love at first sight was an instant connection

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
I think from Alyssa with love at first sight would be my gas

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Ino it was very interesting.

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Because we're both very strong

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Drawing people

66
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
So

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
I would say it was

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Interesting yet contentious

69
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Social what were you guys

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Doing at that time in your life

71
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
You know I've

72
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Always been

73
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
Wild creative but never

74
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Believed that

75
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Could turn into a vocation

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
So of course

77
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Instead of pursuing creative

78
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Things I ended up as an investment banker at Morgan

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,048
By the way did not like numbers because her

80
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
What were you doing Doug

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
I

82
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
Was right out of school I was planning on going in touchy

83
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Education and

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
I wanted to

85
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
Work at a university and

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
Right when I was getting ready to do that and head off into a

87
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Career in higher education

88
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
Got a call from a person I worked Summers for Jim McManus

89
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
One of the

90
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,368
Greatest mentors greatest marketing people in the world and

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Mr McManus said

92
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
Nope you're not doing that you're going to come work for me and

93
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
BMI

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
My assistant be my right-hand and so I went there right after

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
School

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Work

97
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Fur mr. McMahon is for a couple of years and had

98
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
An incredible

99
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Experience

100
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
But it wasn't what you wanted

101
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
It wasn't something that I wouldn't want to do I'm like Melissa and her Investment Banking experience

102
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,480
But no but there was something inside me that tugged and wanted to

103
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
Two things one wanted to do something

104
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
4 children frankly wanted to

105
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Do something of my

106
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
Own creation also

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Bright suits

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
You do well we

109
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Booked ourselves into a little

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
Bed and breakfast in Lenox

111
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
Massachusetts I think was called

112
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
The cliftwood

113
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
And we walked ourselves in the room

114
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
And

115
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,175
Did what everyone would do if locked in a room in Lenox Massachusetts and brainstorm business ideas

116
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,551
We literally said let's close this door and we are not leaving this place until we know what our path

117
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,671
That's what we're going to do what was the idea you came up with in that hotel room in Lenox

118
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,767
I think we walked out of there knowing that we wanted to start by doing some

119
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Interactive

120
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Products for children things that they could really

121
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Interact with rather than be

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Passive recipients

123
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,335
So okay so you get back to Westport Connecticut and like what did you do

124
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Within a week's

125
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Quit your job

126
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
We did

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Weed

128
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
Determine that this is what we were doing we literally took

129
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
AR

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Savings accounts

131
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,111
Put them in one joint account which was

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
Meager at best

133
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
And we

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Decided we were going to use those funds

135
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
To create our first product

136
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,679
Set this point Melissa are your parents

137
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Regretting that they

138
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,311
That's funny that you say that and I would have to say

139
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
My parents were

140
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Scared to death

141
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
I bet I remember when we were in Melissa's kitchen we were right

142
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
Talking about doing this I remember them being

143
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Concerned

144
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Play because

145
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
She had the greatest thing going and

146
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
She was leaving it to do

147
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Well we weren't

148
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,095
To certain exactly what we were going to do for kids

149
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
No problem yeah you know they were up as as

150
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
I guess depression-era

151
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
People they were

152
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Just very fierce

153
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
And worried

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
About secure

155
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Whereas

156
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
We couldn't have been less

157
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
We felt like

158
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
He warrant

159
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Living out your

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Your passion

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Wanting to go to work everyday running to work

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Everyday

163
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Then it didn't matter how much

164
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
You're making or

165
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Zoe

166
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
She was got this like

167
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Small no money and he

168
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Savings account

169
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
And

170
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
What's the product

171
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
So what we decided to do first was

172
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
We both had

173
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
A little bit of experience with

174
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
With the television and

175
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Vision programming

176
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
And we decided that we wanted

177
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
How to make a

178
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Program for

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
For children

180
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,735
That would be groundbreaking in that children wooden

181
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Sit there

182
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Watch it

183
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
They would actually

184
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Participate

185
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
With the program

186
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
And so we literally wrote

187
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Scripted

188
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Produced

189
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Directed

190
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Cast

191
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
Wrote music Melissa song

192
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
Sweetest Thing lyrics

193
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Like a VHS

194
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Video

195
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Ultimately three of them

196
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
So what you were

197
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
You like

198
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Participated you were on camera

199
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
So we

200
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
We wrote a script

201
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
For this and

202
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,991
We literally went around to stores and parks and we cast real chill

203
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
We didn't want

204
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
B

205
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Contrived or fake weed

206
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
We didn't go to cast

207
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
We literally would sit in

208
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
Grocery stores and look for animated children

209
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
And approach them which

210
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Probably

211
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
We literally in parking lots

212
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
I would watch for children that are interact

213
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
And we had eight children that were in this video

214
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
And then we shot it at some friend's house

215
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Houses in Westport Connecticut

216
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Schools

217
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,135
Was it kids singing was it dancing dancing

218
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
And it was

219
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Encouraging children who are watching this 2

220
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Participate along

221
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
He was literally teaching them some of the songs teaching them

222
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
I want we're dancing

223
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Talking directly one of the things that was so unique about it is

224
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
The boy who led

225
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
The program

226
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Talk directly to the kids

227
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Sit home and

228
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Truly befriended them in

229
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
In a very

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Honest

231
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Sincere way

232
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
Do you remember if you remember any of the songs

233
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Go ahead most thing it

234
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Ready

235
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,439
Special friends special friends we will be

236
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Special friend

237
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
That was like the the emotional one at the end

238
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
But the others were very

239
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Dooby dooby all sorts of making sounds with your body making sounds

240
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
With your lips so how much money did

241
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Did you guys have sink into Pro

242
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
To make films

243
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Like it is now

244
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
What's a lot

245
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
Probably I think all told the first one we probably spent about

246
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,647
30 or $40,000 to produce

247
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
Well it did it took all of our savings and then

248
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Finish this we said wow

249
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Is awesome

250
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
And then we looked at each other and said

251
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Will wait

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
What do we do with it we had put no thought at all

253
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Into what do we do with it

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
This product

255
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
We now have to figure out well how

256
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,895
How are we going to be no pay for the next lunch and and what are we going to do to get this

257
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Is product out there

258
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
So

259
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Do you make

260
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Thousands of copies

261
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Went to start

262
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:32,159
So we did and we got our first little lessons in business because right you want to make

263
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Some copies and

264
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
You find out

265
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Well we won't make you

266
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
U4 copy

267
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Make you 5000

268
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Some copies

269
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
And we said what in the world are we going to do with 5000

270
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Some copies we made lists of our relatives and that didn't

271
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
Got us fully to 5000

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
And so we literally bought a little

273
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
Combination television VCR player

274
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,039
Put it in the back of my father's station wagon and we started driving around

275
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
Knocking on doors of retailers

276
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
And the funny thing was this was right around the holidays

277
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
The time when we

278
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Refinish this product

279
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,559
And so all the little toy shop

280
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
Throughout the New England this was there

281
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,471
Busiest time of year and we would walk in there and apologetically carry in our

282
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,359
Tape player in our TV and put it on their counter and beg them please can we just show this to you please

283
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
And I think after enough begging the

284
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
Figured out the only way to get us out of their store was to

285
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
Take a few of these and present them to their customers so we would leave

286
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
Very happy that they decided to take a few of the

287
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,999
Tapes and try to sell them by the way this was another thing that was

288
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
Completely against what was happening in the Indus

289
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Because

290
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
As a manufacturer you never went

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Directly in

292
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
You actually had middle people

293
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Call

294
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Pictures rap

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Who represented your product

296
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
She the smaller stores

297
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
But we

298
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,967
Realized that if we used one of those and they would never do R1

299
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Tiny little products

300
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
They had hundreds and thousands

301
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
The products

302
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,391
And that if we wanted to get our product truly distributed

303
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
That we were going to have to

304
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Do it ourselves

305
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
2 hour sale

306
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
At the beginning people were not buying these

307
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
From the store

308
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,215
So they were baiting in the stores and they were remaining on the shells which is not good for long term

309
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Business proposition

310
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And so we learned

311
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Yet another few business last

312
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
One was that we learned

313
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Are packaging was interesting

314
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Because

315
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
You looked at it and you had

316
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
No

317
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Idea

318
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
What does product mean

319
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
I called the mysteries in a box

320
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
When you have something that is in a box

321
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
And you have no idea what it is and you're not promoting it on TV or advertising

322
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
It's very hard

323
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
And the second thing

324
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
We learned was that for something new like this

325
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
You need to help seed

326
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Some knowledge

327
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Support about it so

328
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Melissa and I then started

329
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
All of our week

330
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Driving back around

331
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
Stores all throughout the Connecticut New York New Jersey Mass

332
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Chusetts

333
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
And we would have play dates in their stores

334
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
And we would sit down and

335
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
The carpeted area in the store and we were

336
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Sing songs with children weeaboo

337
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Hope and pray that there would be one child there

338
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
For two children there and

339
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
Maybe they would tell a couple of friends

340
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
But it sounds like I mean

341
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Not to be like

342
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
Cruel or crude but like

343
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
I would say it depends on how you define the word failure there

344
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
Because it probably was a failure

345
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
In terms of having a

346
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Product

347
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
The instantly saldan instantly was successful

348
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Yet it was

349
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
The biggest success we ever had in that what we learned

350
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,343
From that and all the learnings came from that are precisely

351
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Every single thing that are

352
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Is based on

353
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Today

354
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Complicit

355
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
This point you know

356
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
The idea of having direct relationship

357
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
With all these customers

358
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,679
Doing anything that they want it I mean they would call us in the middle of the night I have a problem with one of you

359
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,263
Your tapes the phone was on our bed we would answer in the middle of the night

360
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,359
Everything we do today we learned I would say in that first

361
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,175
First couple of years and frankly

362
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Maybe mosto

363
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Currently just the fact that not everything is going to work

364
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
So at this point where you guys called Melissa & Doug

365
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Your company

366
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
We actually weren't

367
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
Our first company name that we called ourselves

368
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
What's lights

369
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Camera interact

370
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
And the reason the company is called Melissa and Doug it's funny

371
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Because

372
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Weed from day one

373
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Every

374
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Single product

375
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Made we were signing our names

376
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
And we were riding on the back of

377
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
If you have any comment

378
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Please call Sunny

379
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Anytime Melissa & Doug

380
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,831
And so as we started to get more and more products out there people would call our company

381
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
The end we would answer the phone or someone

382
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
One would answer the phone

383
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
Sensei

384
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
I'm sorry I have the wrong number I

385
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Melissa & Doug

386
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,607
And so one day we said well wait let's just answer the phone so I wasn't.

387
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
And that's how we became less

388
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
Send.

389
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Like one or two years in

390
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
We are three years into it at this

391
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
Explain so focusing in Thailand videos

392
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,759
Basically it was a video year we produced a video year for three years we have three videos out there in relationship

393
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
It's now with I'd say probably

394
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
I'm going to guess a couple thousand

395
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Retailer

396
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Yet so how did you like move from

397
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Videos to

398
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
Toys like to have you like start to think

399
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
Start making

400
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Other things

401
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,887
Well honestly like most things it was another brain

402
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
We were talking

403
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
In the car about some of our favorite childhood

404
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Toys andme

405
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Talking about on PATH Academy

406
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
And Pat the bunny yeah right

407
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
Of course books that had

408
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
The Tactical

409
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
I'm pieces on them you could touch them and

410
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Pat the bunny

411
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Thinking about exactly and we said

412
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
I don't know

413
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
What made us a at but we said well wouldn't that be great in a

414
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
A puzzle

415
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Do attacked

416
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Puzzle

417
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
And

418
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
We brainstormed

419
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Not having a puzzle that had animals

420
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
And that the

421
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Height of each animal was

422
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
A piece of plush that had the tech

423
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
Extra fat animal in the look

424
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
And came up with this idea for what we caught a fuzzy puzzle

425
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
And

426
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
How to design a puzzle in where to get a manufactured and

427
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Produced in

428
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Where where did you can begin

429
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
I would say four

430
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
Most of the things that have happened along the way we had no idea

431
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
And we learned as we went and we would

432
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
Almost the way you were asking the question now we would ask ourselves

433
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
The question then so

434
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
We need

435
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Animals

436
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Artist

437
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
How do we do that so we went to the library week

438
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Look at

439
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
A lot of children's books

440
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
We look for an illustrator that we liked and we would

441
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Contact illustrator

442
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Let's see who might want to help illustrate this

443
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
I'm in each step of the way was

444
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
You know a new

445
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
New face of learning but at no point was there ever

446
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
A a magic answer or an easy answer was a lot of making mistakes and falling down and

447
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Some

448
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
Horrible learning experiences along the way

449
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
How did you guys a fund

450
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Your company

451
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
How are you able to like

452
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
NOK for

453
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Take loan to G

454
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Let's go see got investors

455
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
You know this is why we grew rather slowly we wanted

456
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
To be self-funded

457
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
And we lived incredibly frugally

458
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
For at least three years we ate

459
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Ramen noodles

460
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Switch rate for a dollar and

461
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Turkey hot dogs

462
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Bugs on a hot plate

463
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
About 50 cents a meal

464
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
And we lived

465
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
With our parents for a few years

466
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Until we could

467
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,823
You know you literally get one room in someone's home above their garage

468
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Help them with errands for

469
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
You know what decreasing rent

470
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
And we

471
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Middlefield every cent

472
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
That we made back in

473
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
Into image what I would literally were not we did not take

474
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Play out at that point

475
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Crater that

476
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Play the fuzzy puzzle we able to

477
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Oh gosh I wish it were that easy

478
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,191
Not quite not quite like that so now so so once we had the design for the puzzle I mean everything

479
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Sing again was

480
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Trial and error

481
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
I could tell you one of the things that happened early on was the

482
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Very first time we went to a very large

483
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Toy

484
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Show

485
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,223
Where you would exhibit to retailers and show them

486
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Your products

487
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
And the agent who we hire to help us make our puzzles had a

488
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
Display setup just down the hall from

489
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,719
With our exact puzzle when he was selling who's busy

490
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Selling your puzzles as his own

491
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Yes he was and this

492
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
The someone that we had entrusted

493
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
And he told us the reason was

494
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Because

495
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
We wanted to

496
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
Grow slowly and bro with r are independent neighborhood stores

497
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
And he wanted us to immediately take them in

498
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Put them in the mass Market in

499
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,503
And because we didn't want to do that he figured he would just do that on its own with our product

500
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
So that was his good reason

501
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
For doing it

502
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
So

503
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Just curious like

504
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Your reaction at that moment was

505
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Was it the Gautam say what what are you doing

506
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
What's going on

507
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Did you confront him

508
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,911
No we weren't confrontational about it we're at a huge show thousand

509
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
The customer

510
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
And when they

511
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
I came to us and they started

512
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
To tell us that this

513
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
This is what this person

514
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Was doing

515
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
And they assume that we were part of it or that we knew was going on when they found out that

516
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
The truth about what's going on

517
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
It was amazing

518
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
How many custom

519
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Where's came up to us

520
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
And literally in

521
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Rhonda Buss

522
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Ripped up orders

523
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
That they had placed

524
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
This person who was our agent

525
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Inside here you can

526
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Can show this to him

527
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Now that we understand what

528
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
What's going on we will

529
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
Absolutely never In Our Lifetime

530
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Time order anything

531
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Sing from that purse

532
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
I think that cave

533
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
A little glimmer of hope to Bliss

534
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Myself

535
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
While on one hand we had a little bit up in the

536
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Exposure to the hump

537
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
The darker side of the business world

538
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
I would say simultaneously we had a really nice ass

539
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Exposure

540
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
To that there are lot of pee

541
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
People out there who

542
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Will appreciate the loyalty.

543
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
That you have to them and everything that we've done

544
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
I'm in the first couple

545
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Years

546
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,047
And are now saying to us we don't care even if he wants to sell it to us for

547
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Less money than you are anything

548
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
It doesn't matter we are loyal to you for everything that you've done

549
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Missing you guys were able to

550
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Recover from iTunes

551
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Like move on with puzzles

552
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
I guess

553
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,663
We we started to see our way you know it's always about right finding the path through the forest

554
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
And it was like this was the category that

555
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Sort of was our path we said oh my gosh I think we're onto

556
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,415
When we come back in a moment

557
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
The story of how Melissa & Doug Ruby on puzzles

558
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
And then made the biggest investment of their lives

559
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Sonic toy that became a million-dollar

560
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Mistake

561
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
And I Rise

562
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191

People often think of nobodies are too conservative too complex or only for retirees

568
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,767
But annuities can be a smart way to Head Market risk and earn guaranteed returns

This point is

595
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
It's the mid-1990s

596
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
And toy company Melissa & Doug

597
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Is literally

598
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Just Melissa & Doug

599
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Two-person operation

600
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
Melissa designs

601
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
All the puzzles

602
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Doug tries to get them in

603
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
The stores

604
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
But then

605
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
They decide to start making other toys

606
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
You know all these made up until that point

607
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Are puzzles

608
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
And we look backward at what was

609
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Wonderful

610
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,456
And incredible from the past and we saw wooden toys that category and we said

611
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
Okay here's another category wooden toys

612
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
Wow really expensive

613
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Completely inaccessible

614
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
2 average

615
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
People

616
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
The aesthetic

617
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Very

618
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Unapproachable to kids

619
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
It's not very playful

620
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
And here's a category that we can go in and week

621
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Can really be

622
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
So at this point like

623
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Kids are playing with

624
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Plastic toys

625
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Battery operated toys and

626
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Will you guys thinking we're going to be auntie

627
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Battery Toys

628
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
We are not going to do that

629
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
So

630
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
We thought it was so

631
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
Interesting that every toy cup

632
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
I was chasing

633
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Running forward

634
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
Right chasing the hottest fads and Trends in hotline

635
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Kids playing with in the midnight

636
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,048
Was like you know probably Cabbage Patch dolls and TV advertise toys and a lot of sort of hot toys

637
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
And that was kind of the market

638
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
And we

639
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Saw in this

640
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Experiment

641
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Wood puzzles that ended up working we saw

642
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Oh my goodness

643
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
People actually still want

644
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Things that

645
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Are nostalgic

646
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Make them remember their past

647
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
But they don't want them Dusty

648
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,712
And like I found them in some old attic

649
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
They want them

650
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
You know injected with Pizzazz and brought to today

651
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
So what did you start to make

652
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
What are first line was about a dozen based

653
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Basics reinvented

654
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Pounding and sorting and stacking

655
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Manipulating

656
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
And doing them at

657
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
Credibly low price points and

658
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,312
Packaging them in a way that it never been package with open the package or designing all of this Melissa

659
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Yes

660
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
It's all made out of like

661
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Plastic

662
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Or would

663
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
I mean

664
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
50% of what we make it

665
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Stillwood

666
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
And then

667
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
Other materials we use a lot

668
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Meadowview

669
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Canvas

670
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
But mostly not play

671
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
So at this point are you guys

672
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
Do you have an office do you have a look up

673
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
Place where you working at up or are you

674
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Still just the two of you or does now do not have some employees

675
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,288
Heights at this point we probably had a couple of part-time people that were helping us we have

676
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
So we have a person who's coming up on his

677
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,456
20 years this year his first job with us was

678
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,016
A mix between helping us

679
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
Change our baby Brandon's diapers

680
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Helping us

681
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
Weed the driveway

682
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,000
And also when trucks would come and deliver products to our house

683
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
If you would help us unload the truck and load the products in and

684
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Help us pack up

685
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
Products and ship them

686
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,984
So when you really like transitions from puzzles to wooden toys

687
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
You're still just selling them mainly in like small

688
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Independent stores in New England

689
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Yes

690
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,504
Occupy this time we ate expanded Beyond New England but definitely the small independent stores

691
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
We were firmly convinced that that

692
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Was the only way we

693
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
We could really get our products out there

694
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
So I mean sounds like you guys were pretty steady path

695
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
And did you make any

696
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Big mistake

697
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
We have actually never made a mistake it's the

698
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,592
Craziest we have had so many failures that's why we love that word because

699
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
Failure is a word you have to get comfortable with and you can't fear the failure

700
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
So tell me about some

701
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
So behind my desk

702
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,392
I have

703
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
About I can't even fit them anymore maybe 500

704
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
Toys that were all my very

705
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Toys that failed

706
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
In a big way

707
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Some of them entire categories because

708
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
Everyday I want to remind myself when I

709
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,776
Come to work and come to my desk that the line but

710
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Between success and failure is as fine as a spider web

711
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
And you really never know what were some of the

712
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
The toys that didn't work

713
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Oh my gosh

714
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,320
So many but one of the lines that we were most

715
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Excited about and I think was a

716
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
The huge investment was a line called puzzle world

717
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
And it was an entire world

718
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Made out of puzzle pieces

719
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,352
Not only horizontally they connected to form a base

720
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
But you could build up vertically and don't skyscrapers

721
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,984
It was the most amazing

722
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,544
Line ever

723
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
Elaborate undertaking and above more Tulane more Machining

724
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
It was by far our largest Endeavor ever hear of development

725
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,928
Expensive and costly to buy inventory because unlike other products the retails were about 30 to $100

726
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,256
Forceps they were sold in sets

727
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
It was not and we had all our prototypes which took us over a year to create and only

728
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
We brought it to Boise Fair and had our play table out

729
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
And the reaction

730
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:24,384
Was actually incredible amazing best ever of we have

731
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
I believe we had a thousand assortment

732
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,760
And we literally by the third day of toys are we sold out

733
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,832
But we made it clear to our retailers

734
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
That

735
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
This was going to be a big undertaking for that because this was not an item that was TV advertised

736
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,864
It was expensive part understand

737
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
And it was going to take a lot of

738
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
Vacation on their part educating their custom

739
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,056
About the merits of this but we told them

740
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
If they do this

741
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
It will be an annuity

742
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
They will

743
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Have

744
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,552
You know years and years of the selling and generations by more sets and will create more

745
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Each set connected

746
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Get to the other side it was all interconnected and it even connected to the popular Railway sets at the time the Thomas and the breed

747
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
So it connected into any

748
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Existing set you had as well

749
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
And they agreed and we

750
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Set it out

751
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
And

752
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Do you want to

753
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Oh Sherrie she

754
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
But that's not she tells all the exciting ray parts

755
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,408
Yeah so my part is yeah and it failed and it all came back to us

756
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
In the warehouse

757
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
Receiving it all back that was my role what happened people

758
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Just didn't buy it

759
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,696
Basically what happened is when we called the stores two weeks later you know hey let's can I send you some more

760
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Nope can't

761
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
It's not selling

762
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
And we would always say

763
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
But you're not selling it

764
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
Take a note it's not selling

765
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
And this happened time and time again

766
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
And then after about two months

767
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
It was like

768
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
This stuff is taking up too much space

769
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
Yes I wanted out of my store but it just didn't it just it never took off

770
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
The stores never got behind it

771
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
To sell it

772
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
I mean I think it had

773
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Potential to

774
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
Take off but it's hard you know it

775
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
It's hard to run a store and you have thousands of products

776
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
And you've Lots

777
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Also competing in

778
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
And here we are thinking

779
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Well field

780
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
Just focus on our product

781
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Reminder There's a higher burden on us

782
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Because we take our product

783
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Really personally

784
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
We think that everyone in every day is going to

785
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Take all the time too

786
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
Explain everything about it the way that

787
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
We the inventors

788
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
And that's not always the case that can't be done

789
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
So we realized our job

790
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
It's our job

791
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
To design it in a way that

792
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Speak

793
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Still there

794
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Customers

795
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
And that's really what we started

796
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
What to do after that

797
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
Do you know when they like how do you know when a toy is

798
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Is going to work

799
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
It's amazing you know really

800
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
I mean we don't have you know where nada

801
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
I hit driven company

802
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
Joke that we have a lot of singles and doubles

803
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,984
We don't really want home runs

804
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,824
Because we don't want it here today gone tomorrow we're in Evergreen company we want our

805
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
Forever even when she's working at a product of Our Own

806
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,528
Test laboratory with our six children at home is always

807
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
Using rrr products with their own children

808
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
I would say the initial ideation I mean you're obviously

809
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
Feeling a good God that your you have an idea

810
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
It's going to work and then throughout the process

811
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
What we do a

812
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
Huge amount of

813
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,936
We call it Mom testing and Mom is synonymous with caregiver dad

814
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
You know anyone who's playing

815
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Teacher

816
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
I am we get

817
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
A good

818
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Sense as we're going through the process

819
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Assist but the truth is that's the

820
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
Joy of it you never know

821
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
For sure at all and there's surprises everything

822
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Yeah

823
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
I need attention because

824
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
You start this company in night

825
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
1988

826
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
10 years real

827
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Before

828
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
The internet start

829
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Takeoff

830
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
There was no reason why wooden products

831
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
An analog toys

832
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
And it's so it's so unlikely and in fact every reason why they wouldn't

833
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Succeeding

834
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
And I think that's been a part of you note to the extent we have a

835
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Model

836
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
I think that's been a part of it all long is

837
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,688
To not go with the tide not go the direction not look at things and say

838
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,808
That's what everyone is doing that's what we should do because our feeling has always been if we copy

839
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,904
Every good model out there at very best what does that mean

840
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
We're going to be mediocre

841
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
By definition because we are simply following and

842
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
I'm copying whatever one

843
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Elsa's doing

844
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
So it was there ever a point though so when

845
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
I don't know like investors or somebody

846
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,544
Set you guys like you've got to do something with batteries or you've got to do something that

847
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
You know Electronics or something

848
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
An integer

849
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Are they say to us every single tab

850
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
That that's and you know that is

851
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
One of the things I think

852
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
That has kept us successful is we stayed true to Mission

853
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
You know

854
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
Ever since we started with our very first puzzle

855
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Did you guys

856
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
Basically did this on your own for

857
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,936
Pretty much until a few years ago right in you were

858
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
A successful company

859
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
But I guess

860
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Just a few years ago you decided to

861
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
You to see outside

862
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,944
Investors correct significant ownership and we brought in

863
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Some investors who now will

864
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
Sit on our board and

865
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
Participate very actively with us also in health

866
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,440
Because the truth is for the first 20 years we really did this without mentor

867
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
You know it was literally was fighting her own way in a very dark room what did the investment

868
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Allow you to do it

869
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,168
The company I think

870
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
Two things one is they have rolodexes that are much larger than ours then introduced us to folks that can

871
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,688
Can help with things and then financially also frankly Freedom 2

872
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
Grow and expand more exponentially if we want to

873
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
Expand our footprint internationally and so

874
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Open up those doors to

875
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
I'm curious

876
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,744
How did you guys I mean obviously if you got I mean

877
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Directions to Arby's

878
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
But it seems

879
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
Like you have a great relationship and

880
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
Your great business partners but also a great

881
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
A couple with parents

882
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
We got kids wealthy

883
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
What's 6 kids

884
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Yep

885
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,920
You were just trying to figure out how many kids she was going to stay with her first husband

886
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,272
I was going to say do you consider Doug a child or not

887
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Six children and then.

888
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Stupid like honestly

889
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Was it all like

890
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Blissful

891
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,232
Joyful and laughing ORD were there moments of tension between the two

892
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
You mean this morning or in general

893
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
It's a combination the good news is that we

894
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,776
We absolutely do have things that we disagree on which is good and which is healthy

895
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
But I would have to say that I think

896
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
We have

897
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,432
Our respect and admiration that that keeps it working

898
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Perfectly

899
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
You know both from a business and a personal

900
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
I mean in terms of

901
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
The business

902
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
We never would have been able to make it

903
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Without each other

904
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
I mean this is

905
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Absolutely

906
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,304
A partnership and a partnership is necessary to go through

907
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Everything we've gone through I mean this

908
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,168
Although it seems Blissful and easy

909
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
Are the 28 years has not been easy and we have faced every challenge imaginable and it goes on and on

910
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
Everyday Melissa & Doug Bernstein run the toy company

911
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Melissa & Doug

912
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
The company has grown from just the two of them to almost a thousand employees with revenue of more than three

913
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
350 million dollars a year

914
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
And they still make lots

915
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,424
Lots of puzzles remember the letter puzzle you take the letter out and says it's a

916
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
You hear the sound of the letter

917
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,056
For some reason one or two letters weren't in the right slot

918
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
Fall asleep in my kids room with them in the middle and I just heard

919
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Jay

920
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
Where's that coming from Over the sensor

921
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,232
Is that what this is all about you want to reply to do you want a replacement for that

922
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632

Time now for how you built that

938
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
And the story we ran about a year ago this one is from Joshua esnard grew up in Ithaca

939
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
New York we were immigrants

940
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,272
From St Lucia in the Caribbean and my dad being an old-school Caribbean guy

941
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
Everyone knows about the old school parents they cut their children's hair they did but his dad's

942
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Version of a haircut

943
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,024
Was not exactly Joshua's idea of a haircut

944
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
And I wanted to edge up my hair and have a

945
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
The cooler hairstyle so I realized that I need to find a way to give myself the Styles at all the key

946
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
Cool kids ad

947
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
To pay a barber

948
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
And what he tried giving himself a cut with his dad's Clippers

949
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Well I ended up

950
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
With bald spots

951
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Let's just say that I spent

952
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
A lot of time in middle school with hats on my

953
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
Joshua is 13 at the time

954
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,696
The kind of kid who loved

955
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
How to draw and design and I realized that if I can cut some pieces of plastic and cardboard

956
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
And mess them together for

957
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Certain designs and stencils

958
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
I may be able to use that as a

959
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
As a guide

960
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
To help me cut my

961
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
My hair invented

962
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
Basically he head stencil

963
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Press it against his head

964
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,272
And then head shave around it and the first haircut was

965
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Perfect Liker

966
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
The Chris

967
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,184
Curves on my sideburns for just amazing to the point that

968
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
People like man you went to the barber

969
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
Who's your Barber

970
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
Me I'm the barber he would say

971
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
And Joshua kept

972
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,448
Using his stencil through middle school and then High School

973
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,544
And in his mid-20s he decided to patent his invention

974
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
In a few months

975
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,432
The cut buddy was born so I actually took the product

976
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,272
And I shot a video of me cutting my own hair

977
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
With the cut buddy

978
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
He put it on YouTube and

979
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,904
I'm sales but also

980
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
Maybe this is because Joshua doesn't have the best

981
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Care for the sort of thing

982
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Some people started to

983
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
Control him

984
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,352
Oh my goodness he has a receding hairline

985
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
His products suck

986
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,192
But what they didn't realize was that

987
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,032
The main issue was obviously me as the model

988
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
So Joshua cast out for guys with

989
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Perfect hair 2

990
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
2 demo his product on YouTube

991
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
And those videos they actually started to work

992
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
He started selling like a few dozen cut buddy

993
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
And then

994
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,880
What a popular DIY sight post

995
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
One of the videos

996
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Went viral

997
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
I'll never forget it

998
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
I'm putting on my clothes

999
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
And my phone just starts going

1000
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:28,192
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

1001
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
Notification

1002
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
All this happened in March of 2016

1003
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
And Joshua started to get hundreds of orders

1004
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
The cut buddy

1005
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
And since then

1006
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
He sold about 90

1007
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
You also get a chance

1008
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
To go on Shark Tank

1009
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
And where the Sharks gave him a

1010
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
$300,000 investment

1011
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
And with that money

1012
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
He's starting to get the

1013
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
The cut buddy into some major chain stores

1014
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Target and another piece of good news his wife

1015
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
