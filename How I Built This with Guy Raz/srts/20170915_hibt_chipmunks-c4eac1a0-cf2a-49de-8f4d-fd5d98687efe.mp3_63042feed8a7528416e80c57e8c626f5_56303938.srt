Even quite a bit for rocks

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Part because

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
I'm like most other creative people in Hollywood

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160

67
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184

Chipmunks Inc

00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Is pretty much a family business

70
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Run out of Ross in

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072

Near Santa Barbara California

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Actually invent the Chipmunks the actual image

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Ventura was Ross's dad

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Rossini

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,944
Singer was a struggling songwriter

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Looking for a break

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
Figured out a way to change the pitch

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Elvis singing voice

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Are the results

81
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
The Witch Doctor song

82
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,632
The song became a hit and run

83
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
Soon came up with this concept that it was sung by these

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Anthropomorphic rodents

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Call the Chipmunks

86
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
Are all the sudden Rush seniors career took off

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
The Chipmunks became a radio show and then

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Cartoon on

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Television

90
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Infer Ross Jr

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
He watched his dad

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Become famous

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
100% it changed

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
Literally overnight first with witch doctor witch

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
It was like March 1958

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
And then of course

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
The Chipmunks were

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
That November December

99
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
So we got a swimming pool

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,263
Also I was I was much more impressed that we had a swimming pool than that my dad

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
It was on The Ed Sullivan

102
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
Show doing the witch doctor or Dick Clark's

103
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
American band

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Stand weather

105
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
I remember he would always bring my brother and sister and I

106
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Into his Dannon play

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
Whether it was Witch Doctor the Chipmunks song or whatever and we loved

108
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
When Alden started talking back

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
To our dad

110
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
We just

111
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Fell in love

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
With nausea

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
The song but the audacity

114
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Of that little character

115
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Because we didn't really talk back

116
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
To my dad that much so we thought Alvin really

117
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
We had a lot of spunk

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
That we admire

119
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
What was your dad like was he

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Elysium

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Saying what the witch doctor

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
We see this impresario was he charismatic was he silly or

123
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
You know what he was all about

124
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Guy he was

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Bigger than life he was served the Armenian version of

126
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
The Zorba the Greek

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
So are all 5-7 up him but you always thought and everyone a mess

128
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Thought that he was 6-5

129
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
He just carried himself that way but he was

130
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Funny

131
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
He was incredibly creative

132
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
If he loved me

133
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Music in really thought of himself

134
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
As a musician

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
He loved songwriting

136
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
Started writing songs

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
When he was 16 years old

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Driving a truck in The Vineyards of

139
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
The Fresno

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Dinosaur song was

141
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Call nuts to you

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
So,

143
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
From nuts

144
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Game little

145
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Yeah

146
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
So when you were a kid Ross

147
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Did you think that

148
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
You would be involved in in the family business

149
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
100% no

150
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
You know

151
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
A growing up

152
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
I didn't even want to go to the recording session

153
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Since my dad would say

154
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
Do you want to come and let's see how we do this and what

155
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
I go yeah I know

156
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
I got a big little league game here so

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
I'm going to not make it to that

158
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
But growing up

159
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
As I start

160
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Realized

161
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
What kind of a career was I heading for

162
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Are the only thing I was certain of while my dad

163
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Still alive was that

164
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
I wasn't going to

165
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,031
Be involved with the Chipmunks or what my dad done not because I didn't love what he had created but because

166
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
They were such big shoes

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
To fill

168
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
That I didn't want to try and step into

169
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
2

170
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
I know rostad

171
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
SeaWorld

172
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
3 when

173
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
When your dad died

174
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Brett young like

175
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Is early 50s

176
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
What would he want you to do

177
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
With your life

178
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
My dad passed away and before he had passed away he said

179
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
I really want to encourage you

180
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Go to Los

181
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
School and I

182
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
I just hated that idea but when he passed away

183
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
All of a sudden

184
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
You saw the kind of

185
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,687
Folks coming out of the woodwork that would try and take

186
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Whether it was music

187
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Publishing

188
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
From the family or

189
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Wineries and Vineyards

190
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
He had built

191
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
Stop over the years and I realized

192
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
That my dad wanted me to go to lhasa

193
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
School obviously not to become a lawyer but basically to have a

Protection

197
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Because he always

198
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
It said look there's creating

199
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
What you do and then there's

200
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Continuing to own

201
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
You doing and those are tough things

202
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
To do at both X and less you know

203
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
How to protect yourself

204
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Open and contracts

205
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Boxing Sulphur soap

206
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,343
After he passed away I immediately enrolled Plus

207
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
School so I graduated

208
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999

Pasquale butt

210
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Wanted to know that

00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
With a music publishing and end the things that I was hoped

212
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
To create

213
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Later on

214
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
I wanted to know how to

215
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Hold on to them as my dad had done

216
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Did you I mean at that point where you

217
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Already thinking about

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Getaway stat to revive

219
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
The Chipmunks

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Yes

221
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
After my dad passed away

222
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
I would go up into his office and just listen to

223
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
The song

224
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
30 and done why walk

225
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
The old TV shows

226
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
Sofia done at the Alvin show

227
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
And

228
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
I just thought

229
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
I didn't want the Chipmunks

230
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
2

231
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Pass away as suddenly is my dad

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
And I wanted to figure out

233
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Someway.

234
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Try and bring them back

235
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
So when I met Janice

236
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
And she had loved

237
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
The characters growing up and

238
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
One of the shows at her

239
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Folk sweater

240
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Mercy

241
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
So I now had

242
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
Another believer with me

243
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
And I said

244
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Jenna just want to see

245
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
If we can do this for you don't just a year or two

246
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Bring you no kind of a trip

247
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Get to my dad and then

248
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
And imma go and do you know of course all the other things that were interest

249
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Janice

250
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
About where you were

251
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Because you were

252
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
You were like you are an actor

253
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah

254
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Could you yuan Ross

255
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,127
Well we met at a Health Food Vegetarian restaurant

256
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
When I'm in LA

257
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Saw

258
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
A friend of mine

259
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Who is

260
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Having dinner with raw so I didn't know

261
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
I went up to her to say hello and

262
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Was introduced

263
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Mr. Ross

264
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
And

265
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
The following day I got a

266
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Bouquet of flowers

267
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Where is where I was born

268
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Working and

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
The next day I got another

270
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Okay and they were all signed

271
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
By Ross

272
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
But I

273
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
I hadn't remembered his name so I didn't know who is sending me these flowers

274
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,407
I made quite the impression that you can tell ya

275
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
For several weeks

276
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
And

277
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Finally he called

278
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
He said hi

279
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Agenesis rothys

280
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Ross

281
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Thank you for those flowers there

282
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Beautiful

283
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,279
Who are you

284
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
308

285
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
And it it took about

286
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887
3 years for me to come around

287
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
3 years

288
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
And so he took me to his father's office

289
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
At at night and it was

290
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
And I'm going up the elevator and I'm thinking

291
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Where we going in

292
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,015
I didn't tell anybody I was going out with this guy and what are we doing in this Phil hanging

293
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,135
Put on the weak spark into an office and they put on the old Chipmunks

294
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
And I thought wow

295
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,279
He's staying and then he told me he was the son of prospect

296
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Vissarion

297
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
And I said oh my God that was one of the

298
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Douche few cartoon shows I watch

299
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Austin and love them

300
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,335
So then he said you think they would be viable today and I said

301
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
I would think so

302
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
And I had it listed her

303
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
On my impossible Quest

304
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Stud My Little Don Quixote

305
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Fighting fighting these little windmills

306
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
The Chipmunks exactly

307
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
You just like

308
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Start trying to

309
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Pitch people on on the

310
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Yep we'll first

311
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,703
We went to CVS because they had run the old shows the Alvin show so that seem like an act

312
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
To go in and

313
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,823
Listen we thought we loved what your dad did

314
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
That we thought it was great that we

315
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
We think history is moved on in and it had its

316
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Wonderful time and that's

317
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
That's really over

318
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
So then we went to the music

319
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,623
The side of things and I don't know if they just spoken to the people at CVS

320
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,511
They said you know that was a wonderful wonderful characters and your dad had a great

321
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Success but we think that's a

322
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,423
Time has passed in and you guys should move on to something after young and capable and off

323
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
Hugo

324
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Continue to happen

325
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Just go to

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Studios and production companies in and they would

327
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,663
Just turn it down three months are in 4 years

328
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
And Super Why did you stick with it I mean

329
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
You eat at that point your

330
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,855
I guess you're in your twenties and you've got a lot of Grease

331
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Possibilities are married at this point

332
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
How long should you

333
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
You keep going out and getting rejected and how long was it

334
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Set period of time

335
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
First of all although

336
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
A nose

337
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Fuel Dross

338
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
And then actually fueled me as well

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
So

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Write their name

341
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
When we make this big

342
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
We're going to

343
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,015
What we see them again oh now you wanted well we're not going to give it to you and I like a fool to take out my little

344
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,111
You spell your last name for me

345
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
I mean really how did you keep going at it when when all these people are saying

346
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
No no no I mean work

347
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Dejected

348
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Just feel like humiliated or did you know honestly I didn't

349
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
I just felt

350
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Hopewell

351
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,495
I am going to show them they're wrong I know this

352
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
This is going to work

353
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Janice believes in it there's two of us for goodness sakes so no I was just more

354
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
And more

355
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Asset

356
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
On what however long this took

357
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Yeah but I mean look

358
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,951
The Beatles Advocate you can understand from moment you can understand what why a television

359
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Executive at

360
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Time somebody who who who

361
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
Next big thing to do it

362
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Would certainly look at your proposal today at the throwback to the

363
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
The 50s were doing like

364
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
Roomba crazy things now

365
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Nina Ross taught me the power of tenacity

366
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Guy he pursued me for

367
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
For three years

368
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Every single day

369
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
Because because because I knew we were right I knew what this was.

370
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Perfect person for me

371
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
And not to equate Janice Wu

372
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
With the chipmunks butt

373
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,303
But I honestly believe it when you really believe in something so clearly

374
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Play it's so

375
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
Clear for you as a as

376
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
That was for me I didn't

377
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Care what anybody else

378
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Said

379
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
We were going to make this happen if it took

380
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Took a year

381
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Orphan

382
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
3

383
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
Why did you believe that it would work any why all of these experts

384
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Noah

385
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
What all of these people who

386
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Experts on television

387
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Look this is a

388
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
This is oldest

389
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
Tire franchise like Beano just enjoy life and

390
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,815
Why did you think they were wrong to to two things number one

391
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
What we came to realize is that there actually are no a

392
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
You know nobody

393
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Really

394
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
And so I was just willing to

395
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
To put my belief

396
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Above

397
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
What other people were

398
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
We're telling us in and Janice felt

399
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
The same way we thought they were

400
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
Yeah I felt I felt that

401
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Let you know in listening

402
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
2

403
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
The Chipmunks song in the witch doctor

404
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Doctor in Alvin

405
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
President

406
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
That there was this relationship

407
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
With Dave and this

408
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,607
Chipmunk who kept pushing his buttons and I believed that relationship

409
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
And so did millions of

410
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Other people and and he really enjoyed

411
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,543
That that Dave and Alvin really endeared themselves

412
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
To us and I thought

413
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
If we could get that relationship in the shows

414
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Then it could happen again

415
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
So what happened what was the turning point

416
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
The turning point was a disc

417
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Stockings

418
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343

Found out about this and called us up

435
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511

436
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
A chipmunk we didn't even listen to the end of the sentence

437
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
It was just some random small was in a small room

438
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727

Punk album would you be interested in a chipmunk Punk album

440
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
But

441
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
We were

442
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
We're very up

443
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
For it and as a

444
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
It turns out it

445
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
It's sold over a million

446
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Albums

447
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Overnight and

448
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Then the people

449
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
At CVS

450
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
You know of a sudden they wanted

451
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Have lunch

452
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
And was it relatively cheap

453
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Mapreduce

454
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
I don't like to say cheap

455
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
I would say NXT

456
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Wow so you put that record out it just

457
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Cells

458
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Crazy a man what in the

459
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Television

460
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
Follows telling company start to call you will right after that as Janice mentioned not only were the TV

461
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
Folks who we'd gone to much more receptive and now interested

462
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
But it also gave us a

463
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
To chance to look at doing

464
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
More music

465
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
Because obviously it is sold so well

466
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
So we were approached

467
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
To do not only

468
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Christmas album but also

469
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
Okay what would be

470
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
You know the

471
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
The farthest

472
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Thing away

473
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
From

474
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
This album cuz we didn't want to

475
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Do a

476
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Pidove that

477
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
So

478
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
Urban cowboy hat come out and we thought you know what

479
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Let's go to Nash

480
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Bill and Ruth's

481
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Record

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Urban

483
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Chipmunk

484
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
So we

485
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
We took songs from Kenny Rogers and

486
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
The whole bunch of love a rainy night and got him a

487
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
Country boy all of these different songs

488
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
But one of the things

489
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
The chance wanted to do in that album

490
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Was now create

491
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Some dialogue some stories

492
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
Do some personality and nausea

493
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
Nacho song song songs

494
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Yeah and said that I said

495
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Draw so how do we do this

496
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
How did your dad do the voices

497
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
End

498
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
The dialogue

499
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
And he said I have no idea what did I know

500
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Went back to the house and I played his

501
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Fathers

502
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Tapes

503
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Saw that he

504
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Talk to task

505
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
Until I went back can I said okay

506
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
This is what we do

507
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
So you're you guys are recording this like

508
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
You're speaking beerus

509
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Clearly and

510
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Slowly so then what are you

511
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Speed up the tape it sounds

512
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
The same speed is we

513
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Speak but it's at a higher pitch

514
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Right

515
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Just a dresser like a lady

516
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Disco question

517
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
When you started

518
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
To do the voices

519
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,559
How did you just give me a sense that give me a little taste of obviously everyone listening knows you are Dave

520
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,167
Like how do you record album like

521
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Just give me a line of

522
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,567
How you would record I will do that but I want to also say that

523
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Janice was

524
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,943
Just wonderful is Theodore right from the beginning and I was

525
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Still so tied to what my dad had done which was

526
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Barry

527
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Clear and

528
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
When my dad did Alvin it was

529
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
Hello Dave

530
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
How are you doing today

531
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
Very stilted and it didn't feel real

532
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
So

533
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Janice

534
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
I would say

535
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Ross you know what

536
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
Don't try and do an impersonation of your daddy there's David's

537
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Seville Orange

538
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
Salvatore Simon

539
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
Loosen him up make it a little bit more your own

540
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
And so

541
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Now after

542
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
All of these years

543
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,783
I've obviously gotten better and so now Alvin is

544
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
More fluid

545
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
For me and even though I have

546
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
How to talk more

547
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Slowly

548
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
Dave listen okay I know

549
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
You can continue to talk about

550
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
A blah blah blah whatever

551
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Santa I'd like a word with you and your l

552
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263

Would say

554
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Flower

555
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
Right right

556
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
I remember what you

557
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Said the last

558
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Time

559
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
So can I please just

560
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319

561
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Can I talk to you a minute

562
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
There's nothing more to say Alvin

563
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
No

564
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
So what television

565
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Actually then end up

566
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
Happening cuz it happened I guess an in 1983 that the Chipmunks cartoon

567
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,335
Comes back on TV right before that guy in 1981 Jensen I've been taking around

568
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
The Christmas idea

569
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Christmas special

570
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
From probably around 78 or so

571
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
So so after

572
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,831
Chipmunk Punk comes out and does so well and then Urban chipmunk

573
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,695
NBC said to us hey I know we told you we thought that was a

574
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Terrible idea and we didn't like that

575
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Chipmunks butt

576
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
We now

577
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
Think with those two of platinum albums

578
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
Maybe that Christmas

579
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
Specialist a good idea

580
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
Did you get any Executives that have

581
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Previously rejected YouTube

582
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
End up meeting with salmon and and having

583
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
We're likely begging you to come back

584
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Yes

585
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,479
And I'm not going to give you names but many of those people that were on our list

586
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,855
A lot of my old but so when they approach you they said we want to do a Christmas

587
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,232
Special did you have a concept of what the cartoon would look like a howdy animated and

588
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,096
Did you already have that late already trying to figure that out we didn't even we had never

589
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Written anything be

590
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,216
Before and when they they sit so who do you see riding it raw said

591
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
We're going to write it

592
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
And I looked at him

593
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Across the room

594
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Declared him

595
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Saying

596
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
And

597
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,784
And again because of necessity

598
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
We wrote it

599
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
And then

600
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
No we didn't have a look we didn't have

601
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
The voices we

602
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Still warned expert

603
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Add

604
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
How did you even know what

605
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
Do I mean obviously

606
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
You know you're both super

607
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Smart and talented

608
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Animations

609
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Studio overnight you're standing up

610
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Animation Studio

611
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Which by the way United

612
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Very expensive cars

613
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Is it still hand drawn

614
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Stop right

615
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
Exactly Ross and I have done everything everything we've

616
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
If I ventured into we've know nothing about

617
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
So it's

618
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,440
Stay in start from stupid

619
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
It's the hardest way in the best way to learn

620
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
And you just go step-by-step okay

621
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
We need to create Carrick

622
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
Okay we need to know what this world looks

623
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Like and

624
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
We were really

625
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Very fortunate

626
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Because

627
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Some of the

628
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568

Including Chuck

Phil Monroe

633
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Virtual Ross and these guys who have done

634
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
The greatest bugs

635
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Bunny cartoon

636
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392

637
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
50

638

Were available

639
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
And they weren't being used in

640
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Janice and I hired

641
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
All of them to make

642
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888

After that crisp

644
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Especially

00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
DC

646
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Clearly

647
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Success because in NBA

648
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720

649
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Car deal with you

650
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
What was that first year was

651
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304

00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Season of

654
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
About in the Chipmunks

655
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
Yeah it was always that that sort of Wonderful

656
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
First

657
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
The first series

658
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Steel so it was

659
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
It could be as long as five years but it's

660
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Was one year at

661
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
At a time

662
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
And

663
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
We got

664
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
Very little money for back in those days

665
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Like $210,000

666
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Half hour

667
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Shows

668
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
So there wasn't much

669
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
To cover all your

670
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
Absolutely sew-in weave

671
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,912
Oh yeah we were we were used to going into our own pocket yeah

672
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
What is the show launches in in 90

673
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
E3 this was on

674
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Saturday morning

675
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
That's right

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
And we were against bugs

677
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Bunny

678
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,992
On ABC and CBS

679
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,808
Who didn't want us we had gone to them first

680
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
Cuz they said why do we need the Chipmunks we've got Charlie Brown

681
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Snoopy

682
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,048
We could be you know you could have to split up Snoopy at

683
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120
Anyway so we turned out to be a Again Sports

684
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Charlie Brown and Snoopy in

685
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936

00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Series with a

687
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,360
Giant hit right from the beginning I remember

688
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
So I mean it's interesting because

689
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
What you think about

690
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
The consumer right you're thinking about

691
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136

The Peanuts Gang and they're all great like we love them all we have

694
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
These warm feelings about that but actually

695
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
From the perspective of the creators of these

696
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
The characters like

697
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680

We Are Young we honestly always felt it was like our

703
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
Conversation with CBS when they said well we've already got

704
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
You know Snoopy & Charlie Brown

705
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744

710
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728

Capital One

767
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
What's in your wallet

768
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Capital One na

769
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,456
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

770
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
A guy Roz

771
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
It's 1985

772
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
And Ross and Janice get through the first season

773
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
4 + b

774
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
BC and even though

775
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
The show is reaching

776
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
Huge audiences

777
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,816
Start making a whole lot of money

778
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Remember the

779
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
Deal they signed with NBC was for

780
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
200

781
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
$1,000 for the whole

782
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
But what they did have was

783
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
Something much more valuable

784
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
The right

785
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
The Chipmunks

786
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
I mean you guys own

787
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Everything else

788
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
You own that you own the master recordings you only animation

789
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Characters

790
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
NBC

791
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
She didn't say

792
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Hey if you want to deal with us

793
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
You know we on the right

794
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
This thing in all the lights

795
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
You know because my dad had

796
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
And not only is you mentioned

797
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Set that up he was a

798
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
First songwriter

799
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Who not only owned

800
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
The publishing

801
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Abbott also

802
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
The master recording

803
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
That's what I enter

804
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Trustingly when we met

805
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,296
Berry Gordy years later he said you know I learned a very valuable thing

806
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
When I was writing songs

807
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
I decided to

808
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Found Motown

809
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,768
Because I wanted to own the master recordings the way your dad

810
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
So it was

811
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
My dad was really

812
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Not only really

813
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
This Great Neck

814
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
Pics of creativity but also very

815
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Really smart about business and and so

816
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
I knew that

817
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,408
Is my dad mention there was creating

818
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Wonderful

819
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Product

820
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
But then there was

821
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Holding on to the right

822
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,088
NBC said we will make this

823
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Into a cartoon

824
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Searching for you

825
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
And you guys have been

826
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Pitching

827
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Desperate

828
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,304
Sears I mean if NBC would have said to you but these are our terms

829
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
I mean

830
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,448
Walks away we would have because what we said is look

831
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Will produce it

832
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,568
We'll make sure we get the financing together we'll get a license

833
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Some speed from you we brought in

834
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Kellogg's o Kellogg's

835
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
Was our sponsor

836
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,224
And Janis and I

837
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
Wrote the shows and then we produced it and

838
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Dr.

839
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
First season they came to Janis Ian

840
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Is it okay we'd like

841
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
To expand it now we want you guys to do an hour

842
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Not a half

843
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
And we we just said

844
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,632
We can't even make a half-hour we're proud of

845
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
So we when we can't work any longer unless you make more than seven days in the week so we're going to turn it down

846
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
She said note By Janice nobody turns down more shows

847
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,176
But we did

848
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
So you are you making these shows Randy

849
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
See you're obviously

850
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
You just not making any real money from

851
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
Definitions cuz it's going to pay the production

852
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
But you are getting all this

853
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Visibility so

854
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
But you're also running a business

855
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
At what point did you guys sit down and say

856
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
This is a business like let's think about how to make

857
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Centos something

858
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Really really

859
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
What was the

860
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
What it what was it that you start to think about

861
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
You know

862
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
Guy we were just sitting at home all the time

863
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
So we didn't you see the numbers

864
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
You see the ratings

865
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
But they don't really Translate

866
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Into people

867
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
You know you can imagine but

868
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
You just don't get it

869
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,672
Back in those days we were getting like

870
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
40%

871
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Of the ADI

872
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,816
Like 20 million a week or 15 to 20 million a week so

873
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
Finally got an

874
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
Invitae Tweed did a live show

875
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,472
And it was at Madison Square Garden that people dress up

876
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Yeah we did the voices and

877
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
Design the costumes and got a story together

878
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
And we didn't have time to

879
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
Torrid but we

880
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
Go to Madison Square Garden

881
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
And when we went to the box office

882
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
The guy said no II

883
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
I didn't know you were coming I sold your

884
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Tickets

885
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Sold out

886
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Reconstituted

887
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
See the shot yes

888
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
And he's

889
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
And I said what we are

890
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
We are the

891
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,936
Anyway he let us sit in the aisle

892
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
And

893
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,800
For the first time we saw a fans we saw kids

894
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,920
Waving chipmunk banners and screaming and the place was filled and it was such

895
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
A moment for us it will never for

896
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
Forget it was like oh my God

897
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
There are

898
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Sit there people be like the show they like the character

899
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
I mean your business

900
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,144
Really became the Chipmunk

901
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
It was

902
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
The television show on NBC

903
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
Sea with record

904
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
Merchandising live shows

905
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
And I guess like syndication

906
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Yeah and

907
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
This is one of the funny

908
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,736
Business stories and I found it interesting only

909
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,088
Only because later on it turned out to be such a windfall that we did not know about

910
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
But they said

911
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Look up

912
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
What's going to happen is it

913
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
CBS Viacom is going to run your dad

914
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Old shows

915
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
The Alvin show

916
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
Against us

917
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Because now that you're bringing the Chipmunks back Sosa

918
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
Successfully with the albums in

919
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Christmas special and now the new series

You have to get

921
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Viacom

00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:20,640
To not do it on Saturday morning and we want you to offer them the syndication rights

923
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
For the new series

924

Not run up against us and so Janice and I not knowing the value of syndicate

926
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
Haitian what did Viacom CBS and said okay

927
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,744
If you just won't run against our new shows on NBC

928
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304

929

And they

931
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
A very full of themselves said no we're not going to

932
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
To do that deal

933
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
And then a couple years later we

934
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544

00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Wow and that's and that was where the money

00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
To the syndication rights were yours

940
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
No not at NBC didn't get a piece at all

941
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Tremendous amount of money now but

942
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
But in 1980

943
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
More money I mean

944
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
What is that mean to that

945
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
I mean I think anybody listening

946
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Just assumed that that was it you guys were

947
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Set for life

948
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,968
Yeah well first. Was very exciting and end it was just a number I was always a

949
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
Even when I was watching the

950
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
You know the price is right as a six-year-old

951
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
I knew what

952
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,160
The dishwasher would go for or the

953
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
And my mom would always say

954
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,024
How do you know that you've not bought dishwasher isn't there but I

955
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
But I always had a sense of what

956
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,608
A price for something was going to be

957
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
So I had just set that price

958
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
And I didn't change until we got it

959
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
And

960
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Janice and I

961
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
So wanted to

962
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Make something we were really

963
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Proud of not

964
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Just something that was

965
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Successful

966
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
The TV show

967
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
Was obviously tremendous

968
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Successful

969
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
But we were never able to give it

970
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
The kind of quality that we had hoped

971
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
To do

972
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
So

973
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Yes you would think we would be sad

974
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
But

975
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Because we always wanted to

976
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
To do something we don't

977
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Proud of

978
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
We

979
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,264
Took most of that money and made an animated feature the Chipmunk Adventure in in Quebec

980
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Which came out in the 80s

981
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
And that that movie did

982
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
Pretty well right you did it it did well but we didn't at least in that initial that we didn't get our money back back in though

983
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
Those days cuz unfortunately we

984
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,088
Signed on with a distributor

985
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
That was going to put

986
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
X number of dollars into marketing and

987
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Distribute we were

988
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,024
They spent less than 900000

989
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
Marketing the the movie

990
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
And including the prince and add

991
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Advertising so

992
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
It it it

993
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Did

994
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
It did okay but it did not

995
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Remotely get a

996
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
That's my money back until

997
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
Many DVD sales

998
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
Ross wrote a little article on that

999
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Experience

1000
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Making the movie

1001
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
He called the agony

1002
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
And the agony

1003
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Hard to find a bright spot at night

1004
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
Different stories about because the show airs

1005
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
Is on NBC and you are doing original

1006
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
A new episodes until 1990 and then

1007
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
I guess it's in syndication

1008
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
And then you guys decide to move on you

1009
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
You basically

1010
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Leave NBC and Curry deal with

1011
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Universal to bring the show back so

1012
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
What was that about

1013
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
So one of the things that they wanted

1014
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
The do

1015
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
Was create their own Mickey Mouse

1016
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Send end

1017
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
They had had Woody Woodpecker

1018
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
4 years

1019
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
But Woody didn't have

1020
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
A disorder residence for Generations

1021
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
The way Alvin did

1022
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
Then certainly didn't the way Mickey Mouse

1023
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Stay the night

1024
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
Had seen that

1025
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
When we had gone head-to-head what it was

1026
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
With Mickey Mouse in it

1027
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Album or a TV show

1028
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Or what have you that

1029
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
The Chipmunks

1030
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
Not only held their own but

1031
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
But it's very very well and you

1032
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Came out on top

1033
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
So Universal love

1034
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
That Jesus

1035
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
Alvin could be our Mickey Mouse

1036
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
So the idea then was

1037
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
They were going to create a

1038
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
An animation

1039
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,096
Unit for us and Janice and I were going to run that we would of course not only do more more

1040
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
Chipmunks

1041
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,680
A lot of other things that we had showed them that we

1042
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Wow

1043
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
Yeah. We were going to be in their theme parks and end end

1044
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
That part actually did happen but

1045
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
It was going to be this

1046
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:40,224
Whole shmorgasborg of opportunity and so for Janice and for me

1047
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
Oh my gosh this sounds fantastic

1048
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
Did you have to give up some of your ownership

1049
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,696
Perfect date they bought a 25% share at that

1050
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,744
Point-in-time Ananda

1051
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
In the end.

1052
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
For the opportunity

1053
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
For what

1054
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Felt like a

1055
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Really

1056
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Exciting offer

1057
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Opportunity to

1058
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
Grow the business in a month

1059
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Larger way

1060
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Felt like a great thing

1061
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Did that the money was going to help

1062
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Uscale yeah yeah and they were going to be

1063
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
Also

1064
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Putting money into

1065
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
Development and production of all of these

1066
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
Thanks

1067
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
And then shortly after we sign that deal

1068
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
All the folks who wanted to do that

1069
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
We're gone

1070
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
What do you mean they're gone

1071
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
They all left

1072
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
So now you are

1073
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
Yeah we wound up in a place that

1074
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
Wasn't the same

1075
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
As we thought

1076
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
It was

1077
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
What's what you mean like

1078
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
All the all the people trying to do with universe

1079
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Oregon do you still have

1080
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Deal with the universe

1081
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
The commitment

1082
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
I mean I guess

1083
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Personally to make movies in

1084
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
How to do the

1085
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
All kinds of stuff so

1086
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Why would you just do it

1087
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
Yeah well we certainly wanted to do it but you idiot ask that you have to ask

1088
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
Somebody new comes in and they have a

1089
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
Envision yashow those were not our happy years and we wound up

1090
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
What are standards

1091
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
What happens if you stop answering your calls because

1092
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
You were presumably working on ideas and

1093
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Will you pitching it and they were saying no

1094
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
Or what were they just ignoring you what

1095
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,320
Was there was a, dynamic yeah I know it was a combination of

1096
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
It started out

1097
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
Very excited

1098
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
And then

1099
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
Some of the folks would brought us in

1100
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
You know

1101
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Would leave

1102
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Then

1103
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,144
It'd be harder to get through to them then it would become

1104
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
No return calls and end

1105
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
Yeah it was just you felt very much like the orphan child that

1106
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
That was brought in to be

1107
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,200
You know the favorite son and then all of a sudden you

1108
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
You aren't

1109
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
Soup to did Alvin and the Chipmunks

1110
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Drop off the map

1111
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Pretty much

1112
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
Yeah pretty much demand and so that's why we said to them

1113
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
Listen

1114
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,000
We really want to do this that and the other we've got a lot of Opera

1115
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,304
Opportunity if not here at Universal

1116
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
There's all kinds of Interest

1117
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Outside so we can do

1118
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
Folks in

1119
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Pan want to put

1120
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Chipmunk stores together

1121
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,616
Folks in Europe wants to make more so we'll just do all of those things

1122
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
And they said and they said no no

1123
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,736
We can't we don't want to have too many

1124
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
In the kitchen

1125
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Can I set

1126
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,672
There are no cook in the kitchen so there's not a pot not app and there's nobody

1127
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
There's no Kooks here

1128
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
You guys are just hanging around

1129
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
Pulling your hair out trying to get things off the ground and nothing

1130
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Yuck

1131
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Wasn't

1132
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
At all the kind of opportunity that we have hope

1133
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,520
Foreign and finally in 2002

1134
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
2001 we were able

1135
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Call to go our

1136
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
Broadway and student ID to get back your

1137
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
Yeah we we we had

1138
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Do you know you

1139
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
You unfortunately

1140
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,856
You have to protect your characters in and sometimes

1141
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
You tried

1142
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Did every other

1143
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
Because you don't want to go into this

1144
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
Telling everybody

1145
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Listen to you

1146
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
Exhausted all other options

1147
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
And you're up against the wall

1148
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
But once you're there

1149
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,824
You just have to be committed to that and we always win

1150
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
Really do stand very United

1151
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
What does it does it

1152
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Eat at you it's like

1153
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
It's got to be something

1154
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
Can't get out of here

1155
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Heaven Must affect your

1156
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Sleep Inn

1157
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Just your thought process and it

1158
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
It just must become all-consuming

1159
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,952
Yeah and you don't understand why

1160
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
And what we've realized is that logic

1161
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
Does not play a part in any of the

1162
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
And that's the thing that

1163
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
It's so strange

1164
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
Tossed because it's like

1165
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
Okay hold on a minute

1166
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
You have no

1167
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Kristen Ness

1168
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
AR

1169
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
Dedicating our entire lives

1170
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
To wit

1171
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,407
We should be able to find a way

1172
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
2

1173
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
Separate this out

1174
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
And

1175
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Go on our merry way

1176
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
And I tend to try to

1177
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
It's something in a day

1178
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Perspective

1179
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,439
I say to Ross this is such a miserable

1180
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Experience

1181
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Let's get something out of

1182
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Let's make that you know this is

1183
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
This is sort of fascinating

1184
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
I didn't find it fascinating the personal life

1185
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
Do I have to put it in a different

1186
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
Category

1187
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Then miserable

1188
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,919
And so I think okay well I'm going to learn what this process

1189
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,295
Is like and how do I make this as good as I can make it very healthy

1190
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,183
He approached the lawsuits I have to say I'm I inspired I'm just wondering though

1191
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
From what from

1192
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
What would I rather be

1193
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
It was only settled really in mm

1194
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
For Sophie

1195
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
2000-2004

1196
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
. were you basically in likes

1197
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Suspended

1198
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Limbo

1199
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
No no no no no because no because

1200
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
2001 was really the end of

1201
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
At the 2004 part was just

1202
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
That's when the last

1203
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Payment

1204
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
That we had to

1205
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Make to them was actually

1206
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Done to get our company

1207
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,623
So now it doubt not now it was Guy now is about

1208
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
How do we

1209
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
Resurrect

1210
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
The franchise

1211
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Again

1212
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
After

1213
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
It basically

1214
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,887
Fell off the map how much should you have to

1215
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Pay them to

1216
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Buy back your ownership

1217
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
Two and a half million dollars

1218
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,335
Nothing right you guys a lot more

1219
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
Okay so you guys get out of that deal

1220
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
And then you're

1221
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Free and

1222
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
I guess it was at

1223
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,271
This point that you sign this multi movie

1224
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Deal with

1225
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Urban Cowboy

1226
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Off the radar for

1227
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
Lots of your so

1228
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
To that effect

1229
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Your ability to call a shot

1230
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Well you know

1231
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
Not totally although you know

1232
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
You don't ever

1233
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Necessarily get

1234
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
The kind of deal that you

1235
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Wonkette

1236
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
But we were very

1237
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,567
Clear that you know we world as we have always been

1238
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:03,967
Be involved in every aspect in and then we say you know right from the start listen we are very proprietary

1239
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Terry

1240
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
If you don't want to work with people like this

1241
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Please you know

1242
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
Don't because we'll get the window from the outside

1243
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:22,399
I don't think we are think we're like very reasonable and

1244
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:28,799
Protective of the characters no I mean if we were a pain in the ass I would say so but I think

1245
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,871
Think but we're protective of the characters

1246
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
So is it

1247
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Free movies

1248
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
You made a fox now

1249
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,599
I think think some of the first one

1250
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,999
Where the villainesses record executive David Cross

1251
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
Is that is that it isn't like it's going to be eight and unsettle you know

1252
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Experiences in this is a new one of these stories

1253
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
You know with our music

1254
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Situation with it

1255
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
In in 1982

1256
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
We are with a record

1257
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Company and I won't go into specifics of

1258
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Who or

1259
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
And we're going to

1260
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Protect the guilty

1261
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,487
To hear

1262
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
So

1263
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
At we're we're we're recording and the album comes out and we are told by the

1264
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
Record executive

1265
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,263
Ross Janice I want you guys to take

1266
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
Take the Chipmunks on the road

1267
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
These are the

1268
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
7

1269
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,199
Cities we want you to go to travel across the country to the Seven Cities

1270
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
And

1271
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:44,063
Make this album a hit in the Seven Cities and if you do that

1272
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
We will give you a big National promotion

1273
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
Great okay

1274
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
We hit the road

1275
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
And I won't get into all of the

1276
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,863
Crazy stuff that happens but in any event at the end of the

1277
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Of the tour

1278
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,031
We in fact make the album a hit in each one of the Seven Cities we come back to the record

1279
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
Executive so excited after a pretty bruising couple of weeks and

1280
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Yeah

1281
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
Felt like 12 years

1282
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
And any event we're all excited wanna now talk about the national plan to they're going to do and this is

1283
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:26,303
Does a quote and it's explained why David crosses as Ian

1284
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
Is that character

1285
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
The record executive

1286
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Tell

1287
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Janice and me

1288
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Well

1289
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,543
We're not actually going to do the national

1290
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:42,175
Releasing the Big Marketing

1291
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,479
If you don't have it in writing

1292
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
You don't have it

1293
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Wow

1294
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,831
So that was a

1295
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
Brutal lesson

1296
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,927
A lot of lust

1297
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
For decades

1298
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
Full of lessons

1299
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
You

1300
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
These movies that fox make

1301
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Killed it they did

1302
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
Really well read

1303
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,567
Almost a billion dollars what over it

1304
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,663
Their box office is about a billion 300

1305
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,015
Wow and if you include the DVD sales

1306
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
It's over 2 billion.

1307
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
Well I'm one of those

1308
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207
DVD buyers

1309
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,607
You card right here on out here in about 10

1310
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Exactly like you get a tattoo

1311
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Can you get a tiny

1312
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Cut of that one point

1313
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
3 billion

1314
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,055
So inevitably it's going to lead to some kind of

1315
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
The Clash it seems like it's

1316
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
The way these deals are set up

1317
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
It's like if all of a sudden

1318
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,967
It goes well beyond anybody's

1319
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Citations

1320
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
They're delighted

1321
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,111
Will the economics of it wouldn't have been the

1322
00:47:54,367 --> 00:48:00,511
The frustration for us cuz once when we make a deal we lie we live by the deal so that isn't the frustration

1323
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
For us the frustration for us

1324
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Is

1325
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
Wanting to tell

1326
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,703
A certain kind of story with

1327
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Reflecting

1328
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
Certain kinds of scenes and and and dialogue and so forth for the characters that we

1329
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,711
Have spent four decades with that's that's

1330
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
Honestly where the where the issue

1331
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:29,439
Would be not the how the economic breakdown I know that you guys fight

1332
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,839
Filed a lawsuit against Fox because of some of this frustration I know you can't talk about

1333
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
All the details of it

1334
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
It was settled

1335
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,703
You know you have legal action

1336
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,287
This company is essentially you work with and then you settle it

1337
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,359
You still have to work with them after I mean they're like

1338
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,175
There there must be some bad blood so how does that

1339
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,991
How do you interact with with Folks at Fox is it

1340
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,575
Like perfectly cordial normal everybody puts on their

1341
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
Big boy's shorts and gets to work

1342
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,303
You know we

1343
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
I have occasionally on the show interview

1344
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
Husband wife

1345
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Teams you have

1346
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Kate and Andy Spade

1347
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Sherman Dodge

1348
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Doug

1349
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
And you guys

1350
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Sand

1351
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
I'm always really impressed

1352
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
When

1353
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
When I

1354
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,015
Been married for 37 years

1355
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
And you obviously clearly like

1356
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
Not only

1357
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
Love each other a butt

1358
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,415
You really respect each other's judgment and

1359
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
And you carved a different role shirt

1360
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Yourself what's

1361
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Just like serendipitous Aleworks or do you do actually

1362
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,679
There's actually a really simple approach

1363
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
That we have an in

1364
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,519
And it in this was right from the beginning

1365
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,823
Because of our respect for one another

1366
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:55,711
If Janice had a different point of view and she felt more strongly about it

1367
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Then I did

1368
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,527
Then I would defer to her

1369
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,159
If conversely I had a stronger feeling about it than she did

1370
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,231
She would defer to me but right now because she's

1371
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,279
Writing shows and directing them into

1372
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,839
Designing them and so forth she really is

1373
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
The driving force

1374
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
Of the show

1375
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
And I'm

1376
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Thrilled

1377
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
You know to play a part with Alvin and Simon and and Dave and Jenny gets frustrated with me when I wake him up at 2 in the

1378
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Morning

1379
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,759
I think you could do like 27 better

1380
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,391
But we do respect each other we work really well together and I thought about that

1381
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Tattoo about

1382
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
The husbands and wives and I

1383
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:43,327
I think that it either works and I could be wrong about this but I think it either works or it doesn't work

1384
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
If a couple is committed to

1385
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:51,519
You know going into therapy and really working on their Communications maybe two people that wouldn't normally be able to work

1386
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Together

1387
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
To work it out but

1388
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,103
But we we just

1389
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
Charlie work very very well together

1390
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
You you guys

1391
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
Scaled disc

1392
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Concept

1393
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
In a way that

1394
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Animation

1395
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Tell your dad I mean

1396
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
ABC

1397
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
He did well he made lots of money off

1398
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
Chipmunks and was able to

1399
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Build a great life

1400
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Curtis family

1401
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
You guys took it to the

1402
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
Stratospheric

1403
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Sweetly different level

1404
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,215
The ashes of this

1405
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Native

1406
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Alvin the Chipmunks

1407
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,127
Well first of all he would be

1408
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,455
So proud but but but also because my dad

1409
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
Had a very limited

1410
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
Attention span on things

1411
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,087
I'm sure he would say

1412
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
What the hell

1413
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,183
How are you guys doing 40 years later

1414
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
But I also have to tell you this

1415
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
Serendipity

1416
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
This story We Were

1417
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
In the eighties we would have to drive down with

1418
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,655
Finally moved to Santa Barbara and we would drive down to LA to do

1419
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
Do pick up lines

1420
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,495
Went because the show is going to be on two days later

1421
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
And we

1422
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
Do our work

1423
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,383
And whatever else we had to

1424
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
Filling for the

1425
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
The story

1426
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
And we drove back

1427
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,527
Write a probably 3 in the morning and I just

1428
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,831
Automatically turn on the TV to

1429
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
Unwind

1430
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
And I said oh my God

1431
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
My dad

1432
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,767
I just can't imagine because the show wasn't coming out

1433
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
The way we wanted and Ross it on my

1434
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
My gosh I can't imagine what my dad is thinking and I said no no

1435
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
Know your dad

1436
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
Would be very

1437
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
Proud

1438
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,519
At how hard were working hell

1439
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,055
How much were trying

1440
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
And on

1441
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
The television

1442
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Was his father

1443
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,783
On Discovery Show on Earth Greatest Show on Earth

1444
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,831
And my dad is in the audience

1445
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Applauding

1446
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
And we looked at

1447
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
The tell I couldn't believe it

1448
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
And

1449
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
We start to cry

1450
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
But that was that was serendipitous

1451
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
I have to

1452
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:00,287
Janice Karman and Ross

1453
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,127
Bagdasarian are the duo behind Alvin and the Chipmunks

1454
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
By the way the Chipmunks

1455
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,503
Actually named after Executives of the original record label

1456
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Alvin Bennett

1457
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
Simon piranha Quran

1458
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Theodore keep

1459
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,159
Were the chief Executives of Liberty records

1460
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
In 1958

1461
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
If you ever call you Dave

1462
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,423
You know what sometimes

1463
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
But sometimes they do

1464
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
Or they'll say

1465
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
You know

1466
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,151
You sound so much like that David Seville character did anyone ever tell you that

1467
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
And then and then you got to do it

1468
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,599
Okay well I'm out and hopefully I'm not going to burn the mic up here doing this

1469
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:52,511
Alvin

1470
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,447
And please stick around because in just a moment

1471
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
We're going to hear from you

1472
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
Things your building

1473
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsor

1474
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
Think about your eyes.com

1475
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
So much of what kids learn

1476
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
Come through their eyes

1477
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Take care of them by visiting a

1478
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
Eye doctor yearly

1479
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
5 1

1480
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Think about your eyes

1481
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Dot-com

1482
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
Pay thanks for sticking around because it

1483
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,255
Time now for how you built that

1484
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,095
If a story comes from Daniel Webster Clark of Chicago

1485
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,143
About a year ago Daniel and

1486
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Three friends

1487
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
From business school we're sitting random

1488
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,775
On a Friday night getting ready to go out and one of the Mask

1489
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,383
And the three guys in the group were sort of lamenting the fact that

1490
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,783
It kind of felt like our options were to pick among the standard set of khakis and jeans and which button down you're going with and that was kind of

1491
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,855
Extent of the creativity that we had our at our fingertips

1492
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
As the great Morrissey one saying

1493
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
I would go out tonight

1494
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:58,815
But I haven't got a stitch to wear that's the point at which Elaine said it's funny that you guys

1495
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
Feel like you're so limited here

1496
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,935
Now I got new Romper I got you know a new piece to add to my

1497
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
Collection you know it's a real shame that you guys don't have those in your wardrobe

1498
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,335
And at that moment the guys in the room like

1499
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
Excuse me

1500
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
A romper

1501
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,711
Emily's light yeah you know what this one

1502
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,271
Piece outfit very lightweight fun

1503
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
Colors she goes to full Romper pitch phone she says why actually I have a ton of rompers in my closet and I can

1504
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,511
And wear them anywhere I want I can leave the office on Friday I can wear them to the beach

1505
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,839
And so right then before they even went out that night

1506
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,935
Elaine Daniel and two other friends started to ask each other

1507
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,519
Could this be a thing could there be a market for rompers

1508
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Just for guys

1509
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:47,199
But essentially someone said a lot of guys you know what necessarily want to wear that and then someone in the group said

1510
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,783
Around him instead of her

1511
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,343
Someone said I call it a romp

1512
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,415
Him like Ro mph

1513
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
I am

1514
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,815
I'm sorry we had a moment of a stupid laughter like haha okay that's kind of a dump on but you know whatever

1515
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
And then we stopped and said

1516
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
Blachly that

1517
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,239
It's kind of catchy in and could get people talking and let's go ahead and see if these things exist

1518
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
And surprise

1519
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,823
Surprised these things did not exist mean

1520
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,175
Maybe you could see them on like a high fashion runway but not for the average guy

1521
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
So one thing led to another Daniel

1522
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
Business school friends made some sketches

1523
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
And then they found a factory in Chicago to make a prototype the simplest way to describe it is if you took your a button-down t-shirt

1524
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:34,559
And a pair of khaki shorts and kind of soda together and rompers

1525
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
For women

1526
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,655
The romphim has fun colors and interesting prints

1527
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,959
And once they got all of the Prototype

1528
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:45,055
Daniel and his Partners started to where the robbers around town

1529
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Including

1530
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,895
For a brunch date with his girlfriend and her parents

1531
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
And you would see

1532
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,503
People on both sides of the table for tapping their friend on the shoulder

1533
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Turning Heads

1534
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
To watch ads

1535
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,135
Yeah I just walked through the restaurant in my Romper with my

1536
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
Girlfriends parents

1537
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Laughing at the spectacle

1538
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
Blackened definitely attested

1539
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
There's some head-turning elements do it

1540
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
So this past May

1541
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,119
Just before they graduated Business School

1542
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,935
Daniel Lane and their two other partners launch

1543
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,959
A Kickstarter camp

1544
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,263
Raised 350

1545
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
The thousand dollars

1546
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,127
It also got them lots of love but as you might imagine

1547
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,479
Some haters to y'all maybe 50% of people hate it or think it's

1548
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,295
Childish or looks like pajamas or whenever we're it

1549
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
But 50%

1550
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Love it
