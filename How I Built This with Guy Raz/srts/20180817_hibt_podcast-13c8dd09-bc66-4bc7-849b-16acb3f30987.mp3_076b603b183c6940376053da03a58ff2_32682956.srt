If you ever try to get people to buy something

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
Going door-to-door

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
You know that this can be demoralizing can be utterly exhausting

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,976
But this is exactly how Angie Hicks

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,048
First tried to get their business off the ground back in 1995

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
And back then

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,120
She was lucky to get like

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
Two takers a day

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,192
But of course over the years

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,568
Angie's List grew to millions of members and hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
Company stories

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640

Enjoy

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
People started calling you and you are the only person Manning the phone

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
I literally in like a hundred square foot Office Space

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
And so when we needed the second line we got a second phone so that I do remember times I feel like sitting on the floor in the off

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,384
Literally like toggling between two physical phones with no home button

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,760
From NPR

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
It's how I built this

To a massive Home Services referral program

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
So in the summer of 1995

32
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Angie Hicks

33
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,552
Said just graduated from college in Indiana

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Just where she's from

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
And like a lot of college graduates

36
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
She was looking for a job

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,768
Step the previous Summer She interned at a small Venture Capital firm

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
In Indianapolis

39
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
Airbus there was a man named Bill oesterle Bill was

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Just a few years older than Andy but

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
He already had a lot of business 6th

42
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
Mentor to her

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
So they kept in touch

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
And with Angie job-hunting

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,688
Hampshire College bill was giving her advice about where to apply

46
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Who is hiring

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,856
I was back in the day where you would literally send your resume and cover letter by mail so I sent out

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Numerous letters and resumes

49
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,744
And then calls me up one day and says

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Hey Angie I have an idea

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
At that point he had moved to do Columbus Ohio

52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
He's like why don't you move to Columbus and we can

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Start a business

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,616
Saul raise a little bit of money from your friends and enough to to get you through the first year

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
I want you to commit for a year

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
So what so what you think

57
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,552
It was a little out of the blue in any known I would never have defined myself

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
As an entrepreneur

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
A lot of times I thought of classical entrepreneurs I was

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
Like a they're risk-takers their big idea thinkers

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
That

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Ring my hands about that decision and

63
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Talk to my parents about it

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,008
Well you know you don't feel well you know he's not going to lead you astray

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,616
And then I talked to my grandfather and he was incredibly cancer

66
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Depression just me

67
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
I'd like to pay cash for everything

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
He looked at me without even hesitating and

69
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Looks like

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,648
You should do it in G I mean what's the difference between being

71
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,720
22 and looking for a job and being 23 in

72
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm looking for a job

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
So

74
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Literally like

75
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
Loaded up all of my worldly possessions in my Ford

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Escort in office

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
So at that point did Bill actually have

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
A business in mind or was he just like hey come to Columbus and then we'll figure it out

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
We have a couple ideas

80
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
But then

81
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
Landed on what became Angie's List

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
When

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Bill was trying to renovate his house in

84
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
It was a second house you don't

85
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
This house in Indianapolis is also a fixer-upper but in Indianapolis he was introduced to a little business called

86
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Unified Neighbors

87
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Cars that have been around

88
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Since the early 70

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
A list of who was good and he wasn't in the city

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
For Home Improvement

91
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,823
So what do you move to Columbus he just kind of assumed there was something like that and everything

92
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
And there was a

93
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
And so

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
He's like really try to start our own

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
This is like

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Like 95

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
That's right

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
So you get to Columbus

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
What did you do that like how did you start

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
We started just talking to people that we knew so you're the first stop on my tour was two bills next

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Door neighbor

102
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,143
Did you say it was your pet

103
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
And it was like an okay we're starting this business

104
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
What we're going to do we're going to help people find

105
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
The best contractors in town

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,967
And Patty had lived in her house lived in her neighborhood for entire life

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,575
You know someone did not need what we were selling it was probably Patty

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,903
But Patty love the entrepreneurial Spirit of it

109
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
So she looked at me and she was like this is great

110
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
I'm going to take two member

111
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
One for me

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
And one for my son

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
Give me a list

114
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
If every service provider she'd ever used

115
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,823
And she also gave me her church directory

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
She told me that I had to call everybody in her church directory and tell them that

117
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
She said they should buy it

118
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
And how much was a membership at that time

119
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
$19 or $19 for the year that bought you

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
AR magazine in a Collins

121
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,279
So during the day call you could ask me for the name of the plumber and electrician and then the

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
In the evening I would go out door-to-door

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
And also ask for reviews

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,263
So you you did everything you you wrote everything I assembled them at I wrote the magazine

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
Like magazine is a very

126
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Generous

127
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
Brochure issue Neighborhood News

128
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
How did you

129
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
How did you get more subscribers

130
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,367
I literally for the first three or four months I've basically went door-to-door every

131
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
What was that like

132
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Introvert

133
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,095
Yeah it was probably one of the most miserable experiences you miserable because

134
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
You just weren't getting a traction like Hugo

135
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Door-to-door people would just say

136
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
Slight buzz off for tonight in the mid-90s

137
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
I got now I like to look back on

138
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Call it a character building

139
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Experiencing

140
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Yeah it was

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Hard and

142
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
There was a moment in

143
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
The fall

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,135
And he was like you think about like I was 22 and I kind of realize that this is my life

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,231
Like this is my career really didn't need to go to college to do what I was

146
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Doing

147
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Did you know anybody in Columbus

148
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Bill his wife

149
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
So you were just like

150
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
On your own in the city

151
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Just work

152
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Can all the time

153
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Going towards or

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
As an introvert

155
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
You are totally miserable

156
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,247
So I called my loved one day and I appreciate the fact that you realized

157
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
But I was upset

158
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
Siri suggest that we meet like at the little Bakery down

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Until we get there

160
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Soon as I sit down I just start

161
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,631
It was going to be great

162
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
For probably 30 minutes

163
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,775
Everyone in the fake real looking at us like what is wrong

164
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
And I'm in he likes to tell the story that like at the end

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
All I could muster to say was that I was not going to quit

166
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
So what happened after that conversation is did you just go back out on the streets and start

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Selling door-to-door

168
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
Yeah I got to tell you all the time like I used to measure

169
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Success by

170
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
One or two memberships a day if I sold two memberships a day it was a banner

171
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
Fast forward a little bit more like okay

172
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
This is probably not the marketing plan this

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,383
Going to work so then we're like okay we're going to have to Market

174
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
Like Imogen raise insane amounts of money is like

175
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
$50,000 - $50,000

176
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,367
And so you know where can we Market that we can do it in an economical way that we won't burn through

177
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
$50,000 relief

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
We lucked out in Columbus Ohio has it that time have these little week

179
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
And so

180
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
So we put an ad in the back of the Weekly News

181
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Newspaper and it was in your neighborhood by neighborhood

182
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
And

183
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
It was this little too by 3 ad that said tired of lousy service

184
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
So are we

185
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
So we decided to do something about

186
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
And the phone started ringing

187
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
And people started calling you

188
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
And you are the only person Manning the phones

189
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
I literally in like a hundred square foot office

190
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
The people in the other

191
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
Offices around me thought my parents rented

192
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Good for me to do my homework

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Where can I get a card table

194
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Turn off phone system we had a phone

195
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
And so when we needed a second line we got a second

196
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
But I do remember times

197
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
You like sitting on the floor in the office

198
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,823
It's literally like toggling between two physical phones with no holds

199
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
And what people like your subscribers are

200
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Just call up during the day and then say hey I need a plumber or

201
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
Like a roofer and you would say yeah yeah

202
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Yeah it is like or if I didn't have an answer given the list

203
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
It was then I would go for

204
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Figure it out I mean I remember one time

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
This woman called

206
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
She was new in town and wanted to

207
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
To sign her daughter up for ballet

208
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
I'm so

209
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Songs like hang on

210
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Luckily I remembered cuz I had signed up

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
Remember who is apart of the club

212
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Ballet

213
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
So I call her up

214
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Ballet lesson

215
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
I would just kind of try to make

216
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,575
You were you were looking at human however I cut you were a human Google

217
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
Yes you were the like the person like when you

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,975
Type it into Google you are the person the other side answering that question

219
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
And what was the company

220
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Call by the way

221
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Sure it was called Columbus neighbor

222
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
A simple knock off of the unified Neighbors

223
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah we debated names

224
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
One of the guys that was involved in Cubbies on the

225
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Bored and he was like

226
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Look up a list

227
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
And you know this pretty good name by the way

228
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Maybe heart attack

229
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
And then Bill throws and it's like what we could just name it

230
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Angie's List

231
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Since

232
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,279
Angie's who you talk to and it does make a good story and

233
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
No matter what happens

234
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,423
I can always relate back to you know Angie was the first one that answered the phone

235
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
So you know

236
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Probably not knowing what I was getting into

237
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
That was a decision we made

238
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
So when you ran these ads

239
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
And you started to see more subscribers

240
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
How long does it take before you start thinking

241
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Is actually working the sexy generating some cash for

242
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
Signing up a thousand members in the first year

243
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Azurite

244
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
This could be with this could be a go at it so then we started thinking like maybe we should go and see if we can acquire unified name

245
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
In Indianapolis

246
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Right right

247
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
So

248
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
We ended up accomplishing it about a year after we started in

249
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
So then yeah I kind of wake up one day in July

250
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
1996

251
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
I've got

252
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Two offices so I had to

253
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Start advertising to hire some

254
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Some help

255
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
I'm 22 I don't know how to hire anyone

256
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
So I placed a little ad in our newsletter Tire

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
And I have this one woman that came in her name is May

258
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Interviewed anyone before so I like asking questions

259
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
They finish up the interview and I'm like I'll get back to

260
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
A few days and I just remember she looks me in the eye and

261
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
If you're going to hire me

262
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
You need my phone

263
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Like I was just like

264
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
That's exactly right

265
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
So the next day I hired man

266
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
You know Maggie is now this year celebrating her

267
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
20th

268
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Anniversary Edition

269
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
So in those

270
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
The early years

271
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
He must have just been working like a

272
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
Because you had to deal with billing

273
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Reading a magazine getting used

274
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Subscribers

275
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
Expanded Indianapolis

276
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
Selling advertising like

277
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Did you

278
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
Did you move to Indianapolis when you when you guys acquired unified Neighbors

279
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,575
No I didn't know actually I just drove back its heart that's been half my week

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
How long is a drive by the way

281
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
3 hours

282
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Like what you sleeping

283
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
4 hours night

284
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
It was it was

285
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,631
It was a lot I mean you can find yourself you can just work work work

286
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
There's a lot of time in the day and you can work a lot of hours

287
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
All the time like

288
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
I couldn't have picked a better time in my life to do something

289
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
No family in your life or your kind of

290
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Geared to do that

291
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
It's funny though

292
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Because

293
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
You are so different

294
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
Every entrepreneur that we've interviewed in that

295
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
You are not

296
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Incredibly optimistic about the

297
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Success of this

298
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Company early on

299
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
You are

300
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Kind of thinking about maybe

301
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,447
Packing it in you were not a natural Hustler

302
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
But you were doing all of these things

303
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Yeah I'm going to be

304
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
I think of you in retrospect when you think about

305
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
What makes an object

306
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
You are an entrepreneur

307
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
I honestly I think a lot of times it comes down to persevere

308
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Yeah

309
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
And I think a lot of times

310
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
People can have the big idea

311
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
And they can have

312
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
You know kind of that

313
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
Initial kind of fall in love

314
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
With their IDF

315
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Starting

316
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
But

317
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
They don't write it through the hard part

318
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
And they give it up

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah

320
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,727
So while I might not have had the big idea and while I might not have been the big risk taker

321
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
I had persevered

322
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
I think that

323
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359

369
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,583
Stop periodically about business school why don't why do you think more seriously about

370
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Not prepared to do that had to take the GMAT hadn't done anything but he basically decided in September that I would

371
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Apply that

372
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Wait for you

373
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
Your plan for business school in the fall of 98 like 3 years after you launch the

374
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
His company which is now really gaining Traction in and looks like it's going to

375
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Become something

376
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
Like I guess you could argue that those three years were kind of like your business

377
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Alright like why did you

378
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Feel like

379
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
You wanted to go to Business School

380
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,119
You know for me if I hadn't kind of taking that time I probably wouldn't have

381
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Kind of need for Speck

382
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
How do I learn to be a manager because I was forced to be a manager

383
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Like I got through an acquisition

384
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
And I'd raise capital

385
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
Did I really understand everything that I was going through

386
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Probably not

387
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
And so it was a great time for me to step away and kind of gain perspective

388
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Applying to two

389
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Scified

390
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
2

391
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Kellogg

392
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
End to Harvard

393
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Not getting into car

394
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
What was it like was it was it weird going there

395
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
It was weird at all

396
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
You know I was

397
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,591
I'd lived in Indiana or Ohio my entire life

398
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
This is one of those things where I was like

399
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Like I was

400
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
So flattered

401
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
To actually have Jess

402
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
What's gotten into this

403
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
A girl

404
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Middle class kid

405
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
My dad was a UPS driver my mama

406
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
First in immediate family to go to college

407
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
So for me it was kind of like wow this is kind of any two

408
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Experience and I'm going to

409
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Take it for what it's worth

410
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
But maybe I had a different perspective

411
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
When you are at business school and you would like run these models

412
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
How business is ran or how to be a leader

413
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
Will you like where the time for you to wait that's not how it works in the real world cuz I've been there

414
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Yeah

415
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Yeah I mean

416
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
It was fascinating

417
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
To watch you have these conversations of the companies to cut 20% from

418
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,743
From its bottom line New Jersey alternative people

419
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
People like what we should just cut 20% of staff

420
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Have you fired someone before

421
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Have you ever be actually

422
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Done that because

423
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
That's really hard to do

424
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
Yeah sometimes you have to do it and sometimes that's the right to

425
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Decision but

426
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
Let's make sure we really understand the context

427
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Wow you were there were you

428
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,575
Involved with

429
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Was it your intention to go back

430
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Civility

431
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
How does the arrangement that like hate you should go in

432
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Explore what there is

433
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
We're here but you should go see what

434
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Weather is

435
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Interview

436
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
I realize that sometimes you don't realize what you have until you

437
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Yeah

438
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
So I decided I was going to go back

439
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,759
By that point Bill had hired a chief operating officer

440
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
Who had

441
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Conservatively model the business

442
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
In such a way that after I agreed to

443
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
The Comeback Bill had to call me

444
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
And say

445
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
We may not be able

446
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Able to afford

447
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Wait what

448
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
But why was that because you would NBA that point

449
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
No he was just like he was literally like we

450
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,567
We now have too much overhead and I was like you don't feel are you just being you or is this

451
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,199
In here just like going to be like this is what this is what the model says and I'm like you know what

452
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm coming back

453
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
Screw you

454
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
Haikou founded this company bill

455
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
Exactly needless to say

456
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
The guy that ran the model was incredibly conservative Auto

457
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,239
So we were all fine but it was is a funny moment

458
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
So when you got back what was your what was

459
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
How do I gave you

460
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
So the chief operating officer

461
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,735
Sister position was filled so I just decided to cheat more

462
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,855
This is kinda hard question for you to answer but it's just my observation that you must be

463
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
A person with Olmos

464
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
No yo

465
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
I am I right

466
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
Exactly right maybe I joke around like

467
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
I don't worry about titles I worry about getting

468
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
There's too much

469
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Stuff to worry about

470
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
To worry about

471
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Little Things

472
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
And maybe that's CI off

473
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
Remind myself yeah cuz people ask me is they come into

474
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
What's it like to work at like I like the last person to ask

475
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:40,575
I got tell people at orientation like I am really shy if you see me in the diner you need to come talk to

476
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Okay okay so you come back to the company

477
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
After business school

478
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Felicity early 2000s right

479
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Yeah so we

480
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
So that's what we started opening markets

481
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
More frequent basis

482
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
We're opening one or two year

483
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
When did you go from being a

484
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
A newsletter like a

485
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Physical newsletter to being

486
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
An online company

487
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
So we put our first website up

488
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Play early 2000 or 1999

489
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
And basically literally we hired to college

490
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Seville archives

491
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
It was just a basic like you know marketing informational website

492
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah I had to email

493
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
You couldn't check the list

494
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
I was just for marketing

495
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
So how's that website working one day

496
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
We realize was like you know half of our signups

497
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
For coming in over

498
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Website in Silverlight

499
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
I guess I should actually build a website

500
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
So you know

501
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
It was like yeah

502
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Is probably more interesting to

503
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
Read the reviews then

504
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,808
B&G read the reviews to you for getting people rather getting the mailing

505
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
Well they were just calling up the number

506
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Right

507
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Right

508
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,720
Taking this online is it

509
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
It like a business

510
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
It is based on

511
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Basically

512
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Building a community

513
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Trust

514
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
End

515
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
You have did this be

516
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
Before the airbnb's and the

517
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
The Ubers and that you know this or that

518
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
The sharing economy kind of

519
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Took off

520
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Right so

521
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
At the beginning were people

522
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Skeptical of others

523
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,016
Yeah I think it was actually even an article written

524
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Just probably

525
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
10 or 12 years ago about the fact

526
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,464
There was a Fascination as to why consumers were willing to share their opinions

527
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,048
Like you for information

528
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
That they are giving

529
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
Get right yeah

530
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Of the article and it was a

531
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
There was something

532
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Special about the

533
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
Service at first I thought it was like oh it's

534
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Columbus because I know all the members are

535
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Oh it's Indianapolis

536
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,968
There's almost there's there is a sense of belonging and obligation

537
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
It became a culture of

538
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
The service replicated

539
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Self in city after

540
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
City

541
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
What are the values

542
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,256
We had it was the fact that we started when we did and we started pre-internet days

543
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
In many ways we looked at

544
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Truly organic

545
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Mimic

546
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
For our business model we looked at journalist

547
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Every story has a

548
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
The Source right

549
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Even

550
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Occurred to us

551
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
That we should allow people to review an anema

552
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Isn't that proved incredibly powerful

553
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,832
Why why do you think people were willing to write these reviews that

554
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
They're paying for

555
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Because if they didn't

556
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
The next person

557
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,560
If you think about the kind of decisions are making around your home I mean these

558
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah I I call these like the high cost

559
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
The failure decisions

560
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
That's right I mean

561
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
You probably know the least about what you're buying

562
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
You're spending a lot of money

563
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,128
And if it goes wrong it could potentially ruin your largest ass

564
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Yeah yeah

565
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,576
And there's bad information and like as not a great way I mean cuz a lot of these companies are small companies so how do I file

566
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Weather

567
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
XYZ Plumbing is any good

568
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
There's lots of places to get information

569
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
But people are willing to pay for Quality information

570
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
As you guys started to expanded you

571
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Did you go out

572
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Raise money

573
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
We did you know that you know that was one of the things that

574
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
Bill having a venture-capital background

575
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Was incredibly valuable

576
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,736
Cuz usually nrr raising money came around you know

577
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Wanting to grow the marketing

578
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Okay so what you're saying is you didn't need money to manufacture

579
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,928
The product you were primarily spending money on Market

580
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
We need to Market cuz effectively I mean

581
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
Business we are acquiring around for a long time

582
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,144
The marketing to acquire them

583
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
Once we were able to

584
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Descale to National marketing

585
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Erased open

586
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,384
So in about 18 months we open a hundred

587
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
What were some of the mistakes that you made

588
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Why you were

589
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
In that in that sir. Expansion

590
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
So you know

591
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
We waited a number of years before we opened

592
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Chicago

593
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,512
Cuz we were really uneasy about the cost of expanding into a city that

594
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
What we realized we open there was

595
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
No it just took off like crazy

596
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Why did most companies start on the coast

597
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Because there's that

598
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
That's where the population is

599
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,592
Absolute

600
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
And clearly that strategy

601
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
How many numbers do you have today

602
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
Over 3 million

603
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Whatever you ever

604
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
I'm just about every city

605
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
DUI

606
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Like when you see a

607
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Incredibly positive review

608
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
And also incredibly negative review like

609
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
How do you know which one to believe

610
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
What I often find when I look at reviews

611
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
You know one

612
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
It's really important to actually read the

613
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
List of the reviews and

614
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
I learned this early

615
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,968
No matter how great you are the company you're going to

616
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,368
I honestly believe you learn more when you can see a company that has

617
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
A couple of

618
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Complaints here in there

619
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
Then you do about a company that has all glowing roof

620
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Yuan and part of that is like hey Ya

621
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
They might make a mistake

622
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Can you really want to know how they're going to handle it when the chips

623
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
What's going to happen if that

624
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
You know what the countertop was wrongly

625
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
And now they have to redo

626
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Because that's what music

627
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
You fear when the job doesn't

628
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,248
And you don't on the flip side new years ago

629
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Pastor Leon in the business we allowed companies to start

630
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Responding to reviews

631
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
Cuz they were like hey something I actually understand the

632
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
The consumer gets to get their opinion but don't we get

633
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
A chance

634
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Sarc

635
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Historic

636
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
And so we introduced that witch

637
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Prince be incredibly valuable

638
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Consumer

639
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Because you do want to know how they're going to

640
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Right

641
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:53,312
But I do spend a lot of time talking to service companies and kind of encouraging them not to

642
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Respond on for

643
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,992
Cuz usually that's when they're angry no one likes negative feedback hours to Jessica to get a cup of coffee

644
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Come back think about it

645
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Before their rights

646
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Because

647
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
What they say can be more powerful than 10 reviews

648
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
Might ever

649
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
2

650
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Do you like

651
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
When you have to get something fixed in your house

652
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Do the contractor to show up

653
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,864
Are they freaking out like are they

654
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Super nervous

655
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
They're like oh my God Angie is going to sleep

656
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Ruin me

657
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
You can ruin me

658
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
I'm okay my reviews start weight

659
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
The same as everyone

660
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
But yes

661
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
A lot of times my husband

662
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
Is the one that's home

663
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
When we have work done and

664
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Fixes not my married name so

665
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
So that helps until they kind of

666
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Look around the room and start

667
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Sing

668
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Pictures

669
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
And they were like oh wait

670
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
They're like holy crap it

671
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
Angie Hicks co-founder of Angie's List

And by the way despite her best efforts to avoid the spotlight

679
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
Angie said she can't go to grocery stores or really anywhere without someone asking her advice about finding a contractor

680
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm getting some bathroom probably done this is true story in Washington DC just off the top of your head

681
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424

And please do stick around because

683
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Just a moment

684
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
We're going to hear from you about the things

685
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Your building

686
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors

Smart Water

688
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Taking inspiration from the

689
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
The clouds themselves

690
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,792
SmartWater 1 Epsom by adding electrolytes

691
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
It's for a clean crisp taste

00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
It's the water you deserve

693
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Smart Water

694

Vapor distilled

Purity

696
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Electrolytes for taste

697
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and today we're going to update a story we

698
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Just over a year ago

699
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
And that story came to us

700
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,624
Joe Crites High guy Joel is from Cleveland

701
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
Cleveland sports fan

702
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,328
A few years ago he was at an Indian's game with his 16 year old son Cody it was a beautiful summer night

703
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
Baseball and Joel was loving it

704
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,312
He just wasn't into the action of the game he didn't really care about the outcome and you know it wasn't into the standings

705
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,408
Well yeah he just said this is boring let's go

706
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,064
And I said something to the effect of know I paid to be here tonight you're going to sit there and like it

707
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Been in a similar situation

708
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
This is no fun for Kobe it's no fun for Joel

709
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
So in that moment

710
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
Joel suggested a game

711
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,864
He tried to Kobe and he said hey why don't you try to predict what the next

712
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Batters going to do

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Strikeout hit a homer walk whatever

714
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
And whoever predicts correctly

715
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,848
Windchase and fine and within the very next at-bat

716
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,688
We were laughing and high-fiving and I thought I had just struck gold

717
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
Pinchot actor that every time Joel went to see baseball he

718
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,160
Play the game with his other kids as well and he started to tell his friends about it especially friends with kids and

719
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
He realized a lot of fans were already doing the same thing people told me all I play this with my grandpa

720
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
Are we predicted that bats and we use

721
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
You know this and that to keep track of the score

722
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,800
And people in the bullpen hoverboard when they're watching a game evil do some version of its year later

723
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
He wondered whether he might

724
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Turn this idea into a smartphone app

725
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
An app that you

726
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
You could play at home or in the stadium

727
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,088
Against other fans were all watching the live game in real time

728
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
But he needed to set up a wave

729
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Scoring

730
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,256
How many points for a predicted strike or a home run or double play

731
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Well fortunately in his day job

732
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Chole

733
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Is an accountant

734
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,496
I quickly got out my spreadsheets and started downloading statistics to figure out what should the difference

735
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,824
Predictions for Nat bat be worth based on their

736

759
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
But since we last spoke with him
