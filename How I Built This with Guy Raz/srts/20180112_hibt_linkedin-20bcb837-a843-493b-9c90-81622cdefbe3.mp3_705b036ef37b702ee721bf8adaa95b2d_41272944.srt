The folks who've been operating as BC is on the board or kind of operating in the

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
Classic kind of heavy-handed way that a lot of BC's do

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
The way that I learned that I was no longer going to be a board member was that the financing paperwork showed up and that was just

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
What was in the financing paperwork was like okay you guys are just simply throwing me off the board but now I just

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,944
I feel like I'm a I'm an employee not a co-founder not a director

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Bruise like look I have intense believe in myself I Believe I Can Go build something valuable right so

18
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880

Johnson

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
And what

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,784
Dwayne Johnson was in the game plan with Darrell Wooten who was in Black Mass with

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
Kevin Bacon that is just two degrees of separation

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,464
Silicon Valley was looking for its own Kevin Bacon

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
You could make a

41
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Pretty strong case

42
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Berbatov

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,424

Jerry Yang of Yahoo

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Elon Musk and Chad Hurley before anyone would take their calls

47
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
And what's amazing about his personal network is

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,248
How it's connected his thinking about networks in general about

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Social interaction

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
And how these ideas work

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,904
Percolating and reads mind long before the internet

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Became a thing

53
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
Probably best known for creating LinkedIn which

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792

Billion dollars

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
But he's also one of the most successful investors in Silicon Valley

59
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
And so is his college buddy Peter teal

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Who you will hear a lot about during this interview

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Peter

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Probably the most famous

63
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Conservative

00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
He and Peter are still

70
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Really close

71
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
Anyway more on that a little later

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
For now

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
What you need to know about Reed is that

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
He grew up mainly in Northern California

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
His parents divorced when he was a baby so

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
He's been a lot of

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Is childhood bouncing around

78
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Mom's dad

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Grandparents

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
Which meant things were

81
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Always Super Save

82
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
Both my parents are trying to figure out their lives and so they have

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah they be dating different people and

84
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
And I always have this kind of weird thing where I

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Pretty quickly learned

86
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,696
But I didn't actually attach myself too much to whoever either of my parents were dating

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Because you're here today

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
I don't know if you could be here next month

89
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
So nice to meet you

90
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,912
I didn't like no I don't want to develop a personal relationship with you

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
That part of it was probably a little weird but then

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
You know

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
What happened in a what what do kids experience the normal reading for me that was kind of the wild this is what

94
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
Does what growing up is like

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
But you remember any of that

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Feeling unsettled

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
Well I think it's one of those things you know there's a compass classic

98
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Phrase what doesn't kill you makes you stronger

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
And I was

100
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Lucky and fortunate enough

101
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
But I think I Rose to it

102
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Like you know one of the

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
Traits that I think defines be more as an adult is being very capable as a firefighter

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
I think that resilience comes from the

105
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Instability uncertainty in child

106
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
Feel like a nut literally a firefighter but somebody puts out

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Fires in the business

108
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Yes exactly

109
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Crisis solver

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Okay so you got this

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Kid with divorced parents

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
I'm someone

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Unstable home life

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Where does he go find Refuge

115
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
In which case

116
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
And this probably isn't too surprising

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
He found it in

118
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Fantasy role-playing game

119
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
I would do the absolute minimum time on homework

120
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
And then I would spend all the rest of my time doing

121
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Games GameStop

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
I learned that the game

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
Company chaosium was in Emeryville I was in Berkeley.

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
Until I got someone who knew them to invite me over

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Pumpkin

126
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
Why are you here

127
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Great movies are adults like

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
What's this

129
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
And so what I did

130
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Was that publish something

131
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,751
And I went through it with a red pen and said like I change this I changes you made mistake here

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
I gave it to Steve Perrin who is

133
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Editor the time

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
I remember Steve's first look at me with

135
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Like

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Punctual

137
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Let me look through it and he was like huh

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
The prettiest thing

139
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
Is it look for work in another role-playing packet

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Right now

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
Call Borderlands will you go take a look at that sun

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Focus

143
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
Young kid has been nothing other than eat

144
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Sleep lightly

145
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
And work on that came back 3 days later

146
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
With like just massive sets of revisions

147
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
Suggestions everything else it was my

148
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Prince you give me a paycheck with my first-ever paycheck

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,831
Precocious like you singled out as is an unusually smart kid

150
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
I think people saw that I was

151
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
A smart

152
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
I was in tenth kid

153
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Like you could engage me socially

154
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
But I was also tend to be very

155
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
I was self-directed and doing my own thing

156
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,543
Read when after boarding school in Vermont during High School

157
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
And then in 1986

158
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Landed

159
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
At Stanford

160
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
You were there at at

161
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
Pretty incredible moment you were classmates with

162
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Jerry Yang

163
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Yahoo

164
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,671
In and of course famously Peter thiel

165
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
How did you guys meet

166
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
So Peter and I

167
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Had heard about it

168
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
Each other he had heard that there was this

169
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,495
And I'll use the the youthful energetic language the time it was as Pinko commie

170
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
Cuz cuz I'm a progressive and a lefty

171
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
And I'd heard those guys right wing of the tail of the Hun

172
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Cuz he's conservative

173
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
We heard about each other

174
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
We met because we took

175
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
A philosophy class together

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
We literally walk the picture of inside joke I heard about you

177
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
I've heard about you too

178
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,119
And so we arranged time to go talk and our first conversation was I think 8 hours long

179
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
Where we were literally just

180
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Like

181
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Ferociously arguing with each other

182
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
And so

183
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
We are

184
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
Is that even when we decided

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
So we're both going to

186
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Run for

187
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
The Stanford student Senate

188
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
We basically conjoined our campaigns even though

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
I think totally different people

190
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
Mostly because then in the campaigning process we could go around talking to each other

191
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
What what did you like about

192
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
About Embassy

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Have a troublemaker

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Yo for sure

195
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Among other things

196
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Deeply original thinker

197
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
He is

198
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Super smart

199
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
He cares action-packed pretty deeply about

200
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
What is the right outcome

201
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
For Humanity

202
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
For the world he has a different point of view

203
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
About how we get there

204
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
But like for example if you said

205
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
How do we get as much compassion in the world as possible

206
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
That's actually something he cares deeply about

207
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
He is a very different path for getting there then

208
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
I would

209
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
That's why we argue and talk

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Incessantly

211
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
And you guys are still friends

212
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Thermage

213
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Amazing

214
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Given what

215
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
How his life turned out

216
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
How your life

217
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Did you guys ever talk about

218
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Together in the future

219
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
Not really partially because

220
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
On the

221
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
A second

222
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Conversation we had

223
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,695
We then said okay let's stop arguing this political position what do you want to do with your life

224
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Was like a little second conversation

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Peters

226
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
I'm going to a dance

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
The capitalism in the world

228
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
How did capitalism is the

229
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Is the is the true discovery

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
4

231
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,359
What the meaning of life is and how Society should be organized and I'm going to dance the spirit of Kappa

232
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
That doesn't really strike me as something

233
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
Capitalism

234
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,391
The thing I forgot to say that capitalism is a great technology

235
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Mediocre philosophy

236
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,535
And so you know I don't I think if you would gone back to us

237
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
As undergraduate said

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
You guys going to work together

239
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
I think we would have been very surprised

240
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
What did you want to be

241
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
So what are you still doing this a little bit or still kind of have is a background thread what I had decided as a nun

242
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
Undergraduate was that I wanted to be a public intellectual

243
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Yes exactly

244
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,111
And so and I got a Marshall Scholarship and Oxford which is

245
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Is probably the largest lhasa

246
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Time in the world

247
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
With this kind of thought of

248
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
Okay I'll learn whether not being an academic flossers interesting to me

249
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
And I'm more or less

250
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Learned within the first 3 to 6 months

251
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Fat

252
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
I didn't really want to be a philosophy professor

253
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
I guess if this is really the demarcation

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Point where read

255
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Start to look at

256
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Technology

257
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Because he comes back to the US

258
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
After a couple years at Oxford

259
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
And try to figure out what to do next in all this friend from Stanford

260
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Jumping into the internet

261
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
This was the beginning of the.com age

262
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
At that point

263
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
The

264
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
America online

265
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Kaboom it happened

266
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
I was online there's online wasn't online is that okay I should go into that industry

267
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
America Online was based in DC

268
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Oar Virginia

269
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
And

270
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,295
And CompuServe was in Ohio and so the thing that was local was the Apple computer uworld

271
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
And you're like the

272
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,951
The roommates of one of my good friends from Stanford is also friend of mine

273
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
Work there until I reached out to him and he said luck yet

274
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
You know you don't have a tradition

275
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Skill set

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
The stockpot

277
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
We have a bunch of different

278
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Kind of jobs

279
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
There are no skill set

280
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
4

281
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,567
Like there's no like oh You Higher One of these and so if you're willing to be a contract

282
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Prison employee

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,503
You know we could just throw you the problems we can see if it works or not. I got totally fine I just want to start tackling these interesting problems

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Yeah

285
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
And so I started it Apple computer

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
But you were all this was like a

287
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Early baby social

288
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
Yes and well not social network

289
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
It was like America online

290
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,399
It was an online service and I right

291
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
There was a group of people cuz there was still a lot of

292
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Apple

293
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Fan people

294
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Who

295
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
You know, said owner of this internet thing it's going to be huge we should be pivoting towards the internet we should take taking all the SeaWorld

296
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
Stop and we should make making you all internet

297
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
And so I started working on that

298
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
And then

299
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Ultimately

300
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
I became clear that Apple computer was going to shut down SeaWorld

301
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Didn't really have any plans on the internet

302
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
And so was like alright well

303
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Going to starting internet things the right thing

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
And what I really needed

305
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Product manager

306
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
So I went to

307
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Fujitsu software corporation

308
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,639
Is there willing to hire me as a product manager that was obviously

309
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Very helpful

310
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
But you have the career advice that I give people

311
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Is the go to where they

312
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Central

313
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
About the heat of the action is

314
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
In the Industries or the or the products or the services that you care about and then you just

315
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Work your way up from there

316
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
Being at the center of the action in the Jitsu software corporation was a Japanese Darien in Silicon Valley

317
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Yeah those don't tend to be in the center of the action

318
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
So how long did you last

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Did you last there

320
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
I was at Fujitsu for about

321
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
About a year-and-a-half

322
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
When you left

323
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Jiu-Jitsu to go

324
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
Glad to the world what was your

325
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Planted you have an idea what you were going to do

326
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Well when I left for Jitsu I had

327
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Begin to formulate

328
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
A bassist

329
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
So some of my theories about

330
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
How the internet

331
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
The networked world was going to

332
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Change

333
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Could could evolve

334
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Human exist

335
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
What kind of products

336
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Be good for it

337
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
And so

338
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,455
I had an idea for starting a company called relationships

339
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Which eventually

340
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Social

341
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,671
And part of the reason it would it evolve is it started with a Wallace artist have a dating service like matched

342
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Yeah, but we actually wanted to be a generalized platform

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Blackwell

344
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
Relationship sounds only like romantically

345
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
Let's generalize it let's call it a social network

346
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Blackoutsocial

347
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
It was It was supposed to be

348
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
What what what

349
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Dating like me

350
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Beat up

351
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
What's up

352
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,943
So the theory that was looking at this all is going well everyone's going to cyberspace it was really nervous what fibers

353
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Everyone adopts

354
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
A username a pseudonym

355
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
But what really matters to them is their real life world

356
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
And the real life relationship

357
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
So

358
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Let's build a platform

359
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,119
For how people build out those relationships one set of romantic relationships

360
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Another one has roommates

361
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
And another one is

362
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Is because it working Network

363
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Another one special relationship

364
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
That was the one that we released well-formed

365
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,967
Everyone is oriented towards the dating stop because the dating stop already had viable going business

366
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Match.com mackned

367
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Yahoo classifieds

368
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
There was a bunch of stuff

369
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
People really really want that

370
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
So we were most focused on

371
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
That application but we were doing the platform across all of this

372
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
End

373
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Who did you who did you

374
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Starless

375
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
I started it with

376
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Patrick Ferrell

377
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Who is the

378
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Founder of

379
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Gamepro magazine and the E3 comp

380
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
MN Simeon Leifer

381
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Who is an engineer

382
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
We got to know each other and work

383
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Candy World

384
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
So we put a little bit of money in

385
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Mostly

386
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Patton die

387
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Does money would save data from Apple

388
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Yeah

389
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
And when we raise some Angel Money

390
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
And then

391
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
We knew we needed extra money we're going to shut down if we didn't get venture

392
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
And so

393
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Part of the thing about being free

394
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Entrepreneurs not having

395
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Not understanding the

396
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
The dynamic Adventure mod

397
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
2

398
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
You tend to be able to raise money from

399
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,335
Capitalist if you view the current hot thing

400
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Or

401
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Something that's

402
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
Wildly different

403
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
So that

404
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
Somebody sees my dick all that's really in

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
I should take a

406
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Different back

407
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
That tends to be how you should

408
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Hbc's

409
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
And we were kind of going around going well we got a much better thing

410
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Then

411
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
These kind of currently moderately interesting business

412
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Scissor out there

413
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Like that

414
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
And

415
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
That's not a very good

416
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,519
So basically the vast majority of these turn this down

417
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
And then Avicii and Saint Paul

418
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Aldi's

419
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
Said he will give you a chance but we want you to change a business mod

420
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Are we want you to partner with

421
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Newspapers in

422
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,415
Television stations in magazine we think these guys need a

423
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
I kind of an online

424
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,815
A back-end new business model supplement what they're doing and we think

425
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
You guys to do that and he said that's the only offer money we have we're going to do that

426
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,495
Even though we'd really didn't have any good sense of what other

427
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
I working on

428
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
How much how much money

429
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
Social at all in raised about

430
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
Convert 40 million dollars in cash

431
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
And said yeah you actually have enough money to hire I mean edit

432
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Tri-County

433
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
How many people were working there

434
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
This probably about 60

435
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,327
All in but you know part of the thing that happened is the

436
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
Is the VCS run happy with our progress

437
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,983
And so kind of is the model was back then I was like what we needed

438
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Change the executive

439
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
And I said look I'll help you change the executive

440
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Fatima help you hire a new phone

441
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
It's the right honorable thing to do but I actually don't believe

442
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
The model

443
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
That you guys are directed

444
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
So I'll help cuz I feel as my

445
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Connor is a

446
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,463
Is the founder and as some of the you've invested into the

447
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
But I don't believe in your body

448
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,583
Why I don't believe in tomorrow after how many years

449
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Probably about 2

450
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Two years and you were basically like

451
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
I'm actually

452
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
I don't believe in my company anymore

453
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,919
Yeah and I had very quickly learned a we made a whole bunch of mistakes and watching this

454
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
I could literally the end of

455
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
At most every week or two

456
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Tell you things I would have done differently

457
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,391
Earlier that week let alone earlier that year

458
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
But at that point I was like okay I think I'm going to

459
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,631
I'm going to go start another company been so I just helped you as much as possible but then go do that I didn't have a fixed timeline

460
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Are you there

461
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Rational about change

462
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
It just sounds like

463
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
You were like a counter wash my hands of this and then

464
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,103
Move on to get to see him so weird

465
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Bet you smell the time on this project

466
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
And you had no emotional

467
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
Investment experience leaving like

468
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Understand

469
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
Will let me god appoints the story which is

470
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
The folks who have been operating as BC is on the board

471
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
We're kind of operating in the class

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Kind of heavy-handed way

473
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
That a lot of feces do not all

474
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
But they had

475
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
Decided that they needed to be running the show versus

476
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Founders

477
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
And so for example

478
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
Amongst the things they did was only we're raising

479
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
The

480
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Sirius C

481
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Around

482
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
The way that I learned that I was no longer going to be a board member

483
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Was that the finest sandpaper

484
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Shut up

485
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
And that was just what was in the financing people

486
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Hot bright lights

487
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
They had a conversation with me

488
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
I hadn't yet out kind of had this kind of degree of

489
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,375
Y'all wearing ass and discussion with them and Toes like okay you guys are just

490
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
Essentially throwing me off the board

491
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Fine

492
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Right

493
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
I honestly disagree with you

494
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,103
And so but now I just feel like I'm a I'm an employee not a

495
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Co-founder not a director

496
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,783
And as some degree for me this was a sense of relief cuz I was like Wow but I don't believe where you want to go

497
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
It was like

498
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
You

499
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
Most were most likely to have failed because you were

500
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
So yummy you are

501
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
30 years old but it was a failure for

502
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Yasso the

503
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
The failure was

504
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Emotionally difficult

505
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Challenging hard

506
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,215
I actually think that those kinds of failures are really good because you learn from them

507
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,079
Until you learn to keep a certain amount of humility you learn to keep a certain amount of activity

508
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
You realize that

509
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
You know that kind of the

510
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
I am Superman kind of mist

511
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Sting doesn't really apply

512
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Really to anybody

513
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
About to get out it's definitely a lot of emotional turmoil

514
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Getting those

515
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Simple balance statements

516
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
And I did feel very lucky that I had been

517
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815

518
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631

519

Part of

521
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
A learning this is how the Futures being

522
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Are being constructed and this is how to do it

523
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,431
But I was like look I have a intense believe in myself I Believe I Can Go build something valuable

524
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
Right so I'm going to do that and just a minute I read hop

00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Surprise

560
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Because

561
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,624
We've got a bunch of stuff to do and our model is interesting and different working in that wall they'll give you the right basis to go

562
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Found another company later

563
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,256
And I was like okay great I'll do that and then he said alright can you start next week

564
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,144
Until I really accelerated got a whole bunch of stuff done

565
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
And then started at PayPal

566
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
My first title at PayPal

567
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Cool

568
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
In

569
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
January

570
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Mm

571
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,968
Yeah with PayPal like a hot start up in 2021 was everyone talking

572
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,832
When I joined it wasn't a hard start up when I joined it was kind of tough to be a little weird thing

573
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,416
It was a hot start up by about six months

574
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
I'm just curious

575
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
What's an important for you

576
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Ff12

577
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
To make a lot of

578
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Which was it

579
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Like was that something that you

580
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
You thought you had to do to make your

581
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
So

582
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
I did want

583
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
Enough money to solve two problems

584
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
One problem was

585
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
That I wanted to be able to not

586
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Be constrained by having a

587
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
So the way I put it was

588
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
My Ransom money

589
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,880
And her know you're allowed to say this on

590
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
And then I additionally would like

591
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
Have some more money to be able to fund projects

592
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,584
Be able to do the kinds of things in the world that I wanted to do

593
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
I've never

594
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Kind of thought about it as a kind of a race

595
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
4

596
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Like who's bank account

597
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Is biggest

598
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Cuz I just think that

599
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,896
Useless it's it's not a spiritual identity it's actually self destruct who do your own spiritual care

600
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,504
It's not the way you should think about it so I never got to run that kind of comparison.

601
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
What it was I wanted to have meaningful impact on the world I wanted to do things

602
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,928
They were creative I wanted to create new things I wanted to be

603
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Innovative I want to do Inspire new things

604
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
To you you join PayPal as the CEO and you

605
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
What was your role what were you

606
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Supposed to

607
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
To do

608
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Well the

609
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
Primary the first conversation that Peter had with me

610
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Was

611
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
We don't really have a functional business model

612
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
But we do have a really good way of attracting customers

613
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
So what we're like to do is try to sell the come

614
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
So what we need to do is we need to have

615
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
The company running with the

616
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Strong

617
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Organizational

618
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Aronson

619
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
All the people working here none of us have had

620
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
Any executive or management experience about how to run

621
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Like building startup team

622
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Building management in building process

623
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Cuz you get

624
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
You start to know process startup interview

625
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,448
You lightly built into it and go and we need that

626
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
To help package the company

627
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
Because what were the Prairie like to do is sell

628
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
I'm like literally the

629
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
But I'm a tie

630
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Between

631
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Agreed to join

632
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
December

633
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
And then join

634
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Joint

635
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Guardian

636
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Conversation

637
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Four different

638
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
Companies about buying

639
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
PayPal

640
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
At the same time

641
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
EBay China

642
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Fresh PayPal

643
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
Yes eBay had bought a company called bill pay

644
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Witcher down 200% off

645
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,448
And it locks on spot for many wanted everything to go to Bill Point nothing goes through PayPal

646
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
So you was a

647
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
David and Goliath

648
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Where where we were David

649
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Because the platform in the

650
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Marketplace is owned by eBay

651
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
So it was a

652
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Super difficult

653
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Translate

654
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
Intensely competitive

655
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
And dangerous

656
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Circumstance

657
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
True

658
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
And it provided really intense

659
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
Wartime and training for

660
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
For all of the people including myself at work.

661
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
Because you had to cuz I've heard you describe

662
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Computer Asda

663
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Describe you as a firefighter in Chief

664
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
At PayPal super you

665
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Were you like the good cop

666
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
His Badcock

667
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
He has an aggressive

668
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
Reputation right and

669
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,944
Presumably you had to negotiate with lots of different people to make sure you weren't bear

670
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
Well I was more like

671
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
Pulp Fiction the wolf

672
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,416
Like I was more like that guy right sitting at the blood right

673
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah

674
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
EBay witch

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
Couldn't Crush you guys

676
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
PayPal

677
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
A billion dollars

678
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Exactly

679
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
And you guys are you guys are all

680
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Dunya me you all go your Separate Ways

681
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Presumably at this point you could have

682
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Just

683
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Stop tour

684
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,176
Start a foundation or

685
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,736
Right well they got enough money to start a foundation

686
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Identify

687
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
To tell my Ransom money I had enough money to

688
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
I do not need a salary

689
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
And I thought about

690
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Kind of

691
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Traveling

692
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
4 year

693
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Like just got to taking time off

694
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Taylor Swift 2002

695
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
And we were in the internet winter

696
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
I was like

697
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
Basically

698
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
DC is it concluded that

699
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
The internet came and played out

700
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
And I came to the recognition

701
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Not uniquely but

702
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Yo,

703
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
7 people that

704
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
That this internet when it was just the law of the internet was

705
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Still going to be big

706
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
You're still going to be a variety of new

707
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
A powerful interesting companies

708
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
That we're going to merge

709
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
And that I should just action-packed not take the year off

710
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
Start Angel Investing and I realize I

711
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Hartley 10

712
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
Is opposed to taking a year off I took three weeks off

713
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
To you

714
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
When you

715
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
Start LinkedIn what was the supposed

716
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
How to beat what how did you

717
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Picture to be because I'm assuming you still have to raise money

718
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Burlington

719
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Well

720
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,320
What I had decided was the mistake around social net was was

721
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Targeting a dating business versus

722
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Doing the new category with

723
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
Is working at work impression I work I said

724
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Book the way the world's going to change

725
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Is everyone going to have a

726
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Real name identity on the

727
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
On the web

728
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
Where that real name identity

729
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Is going to be

730
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
In different categories

731
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Racism is social identity

732
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Professional identity

733
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Social at that time was this big ramp

734
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Friendster

735
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
This is well before Facebook

736
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
I need them for my space

737
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Yeah I said look maybe Friendster is going to be the social

738
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
This is going to be the professional

739
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
And so obviously the

740
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
First application

741
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Will be job hunting

742
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Talent finda

743
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
But eventually will do go to

744
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Everything from sales and

745
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Business Partnership

746
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
2

747
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
Starting companies to

748
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,936
Finding information and staying

749
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
A expert 2 fighting

750
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
Skills learning like all of this would be belt

751
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
Obama's platform but this is the first application of a set of applications

752
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
And what people invested in

753
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
Kind of series 80 through series

754
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272
D all the way through going public

755
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,576
Was essentially with the weary transforming

756
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Date the world

757
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Talent

758
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Job searching and recruiting

759
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,536
But that they always knew that there was we could also build to being a lot more because that was from the very first pitch

760
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
But when you first started out

761
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
What's the IDF

762
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
Lincoln weather

763
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Were the people who sing like

764
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah you know I don't notice things going to work

765
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Yes Lots

766
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:38,688
Most smart people said this is got a dumb the and for different reasons

767
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:43,808
I was going to get all these really smart people are saying that to you

768
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Why did you

769
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Why did you doubt them

770
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
Will so the right way is entrepreneur to start

771
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
That is to say

772
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
You want to go to the smartest possible

773
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,168
Critics and refiners say what's wrong what's challenge but they did that was very helpful

774
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
To get the list of what are the key things that are going to be

775
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Difficult riddles

776
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Addressing modes

777
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Immediately

778
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
But the facts

779
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
That a lot of people

780
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
Smart people thought it was dumb

781
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:15,552
Means that you have a Runway to start it that you're you're being contrary it now doesn't mean that you're going to be right or not

782
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,392
In order to get to the Judgment that you might be right and they might be wrong

783
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
You have to know things that they don't know

784
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
What are the kinds of things I knew was

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
I said well

786
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
Most people don't realize that the internet is going to switch to a real identity platform not to assume

787
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
Second thing is I had become an expert in virality

788
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
And I knew that one of the central ways for internet services

789
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Spread was morality

790
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,688
And having that kind of expertise

791
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Wasn't Factory Licor

792
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
In the third was that

793
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
I had a theory

794
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,624
Of human a daddy in a relationship so I said well

795
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
There's a reason we have a home

796
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
And we have an office in those two

797
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Things are distinct or not

798
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
Lies are different identities are one of them to put on it

799
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
There's different spaces in which we operate in those we going to be

800
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:07,264
And I was right about all those things and so the question was then executing through them

801
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,848
To build it out the right way and that was the thing that

802
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
Took a number of years the bailout two and one of the things were Linked In was unusual thing is that usual

803
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Things Are

804
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
You either hit the oil out and it goes to the moon

805
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Or that never goes

806
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
LinkedIn was one of those ones that compounded year after year

807
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,744
Oh you never really quite got to the

808
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,328
To the oil well but we got to compounding an R

809
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Relevance in our ecosystem

810
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Until we

811
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:39,264
Finally you know got fairly big and then people would I call you at Lincoln's obvious now

812
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Just a pause here

813
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Prosecco

814
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,480
You at with the side thing going which was

815
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
You are an investor

816
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
Understatement

817
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
Another

818
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Full-time job

819
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
And you were running LinkedIn at Asda

820
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
See all the same

821
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Well so

822
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
So the first thing is I was doing Angel Investing why I was

823
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Lucio

824
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Of LinkedIn

825
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
Was possible because

826
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
And I'm kind of at the time

827
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Oh well I still don't

828
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Don't have any kids so

829
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
We don't have that start up so I could do

830
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
Kind of both the work thing

831
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
And also doing that

832
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
Tattletale like okay you have

833
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,136
That one full-time job and one intense part-time job

834
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
The part of my deal as an angel investor was

835
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,536
Which I will try to help you with

836
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
But I may be in any particular week or month

837
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,448
Super busy with LinkedIn and I might not be able to help you and so

838
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,776
That's how it work no it was an intense amount of work it was like

839
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
You know hundred plus hours a week

840
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
You're working all the time you're not taking vacations

841
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,736
And so that was the the pattern of running through it but it was a very intense

842
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,648
Okay so in 2016 LinkedIn Microsoft

843
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,464
26 billion dollars

844
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Incredible

845
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,584
And in your no longer running a company right that's not involved

846
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,680
That's correct and I have been running LinkedIn for a while Jeff weiner

847
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Co

848
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
Who took LinkedIn public until what time is good

849
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Read I am

850
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Africa

851
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
I kissed a bad

852
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
I do a lot of a lot of work at night

853
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
And so

854
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm for the last couple weeks I've been reading a lot about

855
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,392
And I was like I had to take an eye to take a break I was exhaust

856
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
Did reading about your life because you write best sellers

857
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,560
You have breakfast lunch and dinner with somebody else you got a podcaster on Multi

858
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Superbored Humana

859
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Billions

860
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Of dollars

861
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Most people have a limited number of drawers in their head

862
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
In a limited number of

863
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
Apartments things that they can

864
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Handle

865
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
I just

866
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,688
I don't know how you manage all those drawers in your head how do you

867
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
How do you do it how do you

868
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
You can stay on top of all those things in there

869
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Well

870
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,976
Maybe the thing is I like feeling overwhelmed I like feeling like I'm in the deep end that I'm learning when making stuff happen

871
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
I do every time I get to Friday I'm

872
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Like Friday night I'm totally exhaust

873
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Write like

874
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
It's like

875
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
It's like I run a marathon that whole week

876
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
And then

877
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
Buy but Sunday afternoon I get back into the room

878
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
And so

879
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
You know part of that is it is exhausting but it's also rewarding

880
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
Write a minutes

881
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,784
You're learning a lot constantly cuz you're dealing with a lot of really smart people on your

882
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
In and you're part of

883
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Like you're being a

884
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
Venture capitalist Greylock his people bring you the hardest problems

885
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
You know what

886
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,792
Keep my mind alive for a like how do I like

887
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
What kind of the teaching impulse how do I help teach

888
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,424
And I do the podcast with masters of scale and writing this book

889
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
But it is it is a

890
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
You're running pretty hard

891
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
You are just 50 years old

892
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
G-Eazy are you done starting businesses

893
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
Are you finished with that

894
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,832
I think so you know it's kind of this Never Say Never thing but

895
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,952
You know there's a wide variety of really important organizations

896
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,072
That I sit on the boards of Microsoft Office is one of them

897
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Airbnb Convoy

898
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
There's a

899
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
Does the set of these different

900
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
You know kind of

901
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Game-changing

902
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
Organizations

903
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
And

904
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
And they're all on my LinkedIn profile cuz

905
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
The horses Part Wilmington

906
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
And so I would have to

907
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
I'd have to seriously reduce a bunch of

908
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
If I were

909
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
If I rent a star company now

910
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Maybe the right thing occurs to me it's the right thing for the world

911
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
What's the thing I should do

912
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
But I think it's very low probability

913
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
Okay so finally lead I have to ask you one last question

914
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
Pretty much everybody has a show

915
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Which is

916
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
How much of what you accomplished

917
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Because of

918
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Your hard work and

919
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
Intelligence in

920
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
And how much of it is

921
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
The Privileges

922
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,576
What's up one of the funny things about these disease are false dichotomy questions cuz it's against is massively both

923
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Of course

924
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,696
You know super lucky to be in Silicon Valley

925
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,536
To have the network of friends that I have here

926
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
To have

927
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,656
Participated in kind of the web 200

928
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Our Revolution

929
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
And have all the skill set and learning

930
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Kompromat

931
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,336
But also course thought about this very strategically

932
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:35,456
Deliberately took a learning mindset as a way of saying cost with you have to be constantly learning

933
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
And then and I'm constantly exchanging information with other people

934
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
I told this a bunch of hard-working that to which

935
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,416
Require skill in La Crosse planning and strategy

936
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
Until the answer is just massive quantities

937
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
Of both

938
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
Lock and

939
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
Reid Hoffman sound

940
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
LinkedIn partner at Greylock and host of the podcast masters of scale

941
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
Connection between bead and Peter teal well Peter can probably think read for helping him

942
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
Become a billionaire because back in 2004 read introduce Peter to a young entrepreneur

943
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:22,816
Just dropped out of Harvard Peter decided to give that Dropout $500,000 Angel Money

944
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
And of course you know where the story is going that investment was in Facebook and that's 500,000

945
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
Turn it to just over 1 billion dollars within 8 years

946
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Hey thanks for sticking around because

947
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,408
My name is Danica La-Z I live in Germantown Wisconsin

948
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
15 years ago when I was in college she loves to knit scarves for friends

949
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Start to say no more scars

950
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
Knit a hat I made it and I finished it I thought and it looked at it and there was a big

951
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:35,008
Big weird hole in it and I thought I made a mistake I tested on the ground really disappointed

952
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
Good thing that when she did that her dad happened to be in the room my dad salt laying there and you

953
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,808
After that

954
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:54,208
Some hair on top of Danica's head so just for fun she put her hair through the hole in the Hat

955
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
Ustedes remember kind of a collaboratively the room looking was like

956
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
That looks good

957
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:08,288
So I started so we're the hat with her ponytail or bun sticking out of it and wherever she went on

958
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
Apus are traveling around the country

959
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
People would say the same thing where to get your hat I like your hat without realizing it

960
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,064
Danica had solve a problem for people with long hair because

961
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,464
If you got a ponytail it's uncomfortable to pull a knit hat over it and it can look kind of silly to you

962
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
Weird balls on top of your head so after Danica got out of college and after she got a full-time job

963
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,264
Job in the chemical industry she continued to knit hats with the strategically-placed holes in them

964
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,384
I meant she would sell them online and that's where I thought that it might

965
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
Where I would keep my day job forever and I mean I was actually kind of thing going back and getting PhD

966
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
In chemistry

967
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
But that's not what happened

968
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,768
Like I get to work and I think I can maybe be making just about

969
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
What I'm making here if I made more hat

970
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
What is competition other people were making hats for ponytails so she intimated she made multi

971
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Simple opening to accommodate different hairdos and she even figured out how to hide those openings so you could

972
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
Wear the hat like any other hats when he wanted to and all the knitting took a lot of time so

973
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:32,768
Danica started to get some help either getting a lot of emails from manufacturers in China what time it was

974
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
Website saying hey we can make these for you I thought I'm going to try that

975
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
So okay she found a few people in China who could have knit the hats there actually a lot of times made by

976
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
People in their homes but they were all turned out to be different sizes and a little bit different shape

977
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
And some of that was was just a major of handmade but it couldn't go on Realize

978
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
Grover business by knitting the hats by hand soap ever asking a lot of different Engineers she found

979
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:11,168
One guy in New Jersey to design her a knitting machine that would put holes in the Hat

980
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:17,568
I had every 18 minutes and I have to stop toilet about every 6 to 7 hours

981
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,432
And so I can get about 60 Pat and a day

982
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
And this year with her new machine

983
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
Danica plans to make about 20000 hats

984
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,856
