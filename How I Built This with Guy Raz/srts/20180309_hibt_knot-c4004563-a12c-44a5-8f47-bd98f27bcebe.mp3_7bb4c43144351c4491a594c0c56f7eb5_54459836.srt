We put together this deck

Practice the presentation we go through this whole dog-and-pony talk about The Libertine and doing and what we were going to build

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
And he looks up and he says this is got to be the worst business plan ever seen

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,656
And and the air just got sucked out of the room

Us

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Right now I've got

3 wedding invitations

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Hanging out my fridge

27
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
That's a kind of wonder about the

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
People behind those cards

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,712
6 people who are probably freaking out right now

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Caterers the flowers

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040

Photographer

34
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,792
Because I'm starting to get stressed out and I'm already married

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Play fun fact

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
The average wedding

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Average

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424

00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496

00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
In the planning for it takes

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Between 9 months and a

00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Tell my device

43
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Elope

44
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
And if that's not an option

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,552
You will probably at some point make your way to the knot

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
Dot-com it's a multimedia platform that helps

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Do you plan your wedding

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
And it's a big business the knot is this

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Center of a Media Group

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Now valued at more than

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
A billion dollars

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,424
Which is all the more remarkable because at one point during the.com bust

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
The knot stock price

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
26

55
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Sense but

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Look at that little later

57
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
When factors Carley Roney and David Liu start of the knot

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
In the late 1990s

59
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
It was more like a child it was a place people could

60
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
Pop into and type in all caps anyone else

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Freaking out about their wedding planning

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Well today

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Can I test

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
It's used by 80% of

65
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
Of all couples planning a wedding

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Which is also remarkable because

67
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
David and Carlos wedding

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Double disaster

69
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,520
Briefly when they were both undergrads at NYU in the 1980s

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
Are both in the same film program but

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
What's exactly love at

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Forsyth

73
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
Was David was a senior and I was a freshman

74
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
And we

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Didn't really talk

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,624
During it because I saw

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
Does he look like kind of a super senior snob to me

78
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Did you buy the David did you notice Carly

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
You did already

80
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
At the point

81
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
But nothing ever came of it

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
So after college

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Carly and David

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Went their separate ways

85
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
David got a job working at a startup in

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
In Philadelphia where he made video yearbooks

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
High School

88
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,528
ICarly was a script reader for a movie director

89
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Your New York

90
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
50 years later in the early 90s

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,208
They both happened to be invited to a Christmas party by a former NYU professor

92
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
And I remember like looking at Cross

93
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
This group of people I'm thinking like

94
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,912
Ponytail why does he look so familiar

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,824
So you're like you're like twenties David at this point

96
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
Can I just show up at this

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Party and

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
I remember the doorbell ringing

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
And hearing Carly's voice

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
And I Milly Rock remember.

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
Then she walked in and made a beeline for the

102
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
And went up to you and said

103
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Hey handsome

104
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
It's funny as we ended up the project

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
We're like we should talk about

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
That's Amore

107
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Maybe we could do some work on some

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Together and

109
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
So we both left the party with the

110
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Premise of being back in touch

111
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Sweet but clearly there was

112
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
You eat it with interest be I mean bright

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Super

114
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Collaborate

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Totally

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Twitter first aid in February

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
We moved in together in June we're married in July

118
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Jump through this story so far

119
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
You

120
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
You've gone from

121
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
From ponytail at the party

122
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
To Being Mary like

123
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
7 months later

124
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Yeah

125
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
What was the irony that one of the starting irony is it

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
The story is that you know I have divorced parents I never thought it was

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
I didn't believe in marriage

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
I thought people just

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,135
Sort of like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir I'll be better to just be in love with someone maybe but have your own home just

130
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
In case

131
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
And then I met this guy. Mike

132
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Kind of

133
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
Amazing he's so amazing he lived in Philadelphia at the

134
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
I'm an I actually that moves right to

135
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
See you at that time to work on a project

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Smithsonian

137
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
And so we started this like long distance

138
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Romance

139
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Philadelphia and

140
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
DC and I don't know if it was like

141
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
Something in the air or it was just like mad

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
True love

143
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
But

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
One time we were sitting there and we were talking about

145
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Taking a trip

146
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
2

147
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Hong Kong

148
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
And I said oh you want to get married in Hong Kong

149
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:56,351
Just like out of the blue I don't even know what I was thinking you said sure and I was like okay then

150
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Let's get married

151
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
So you go to your parents

152
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Carly music

153
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
You like a David

154
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Yeah we're getting married

155
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
What what's funnier is like

156
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
I haven't told you about the

157
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
This guy David by the way we're getting married

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
You might want to meet him

159
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
Prior to the wedding and the end they say

160
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
This is crazy this is not going to work this is not how

161
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Marriages last

162
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
Exactly what they said

163
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
When in fact

164
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Turns out and I never knew this

165
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
They had sort of had a whirlwind Romance

166
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Sanlitun beijing

167
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Quickly and ended up divorced so this way

168
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
It was just like

169
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
Their biggest fear is playing out in front of them and let you know because you're

170
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Yeah like young and spit in your like you just don't understand

171
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
So you

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
You guys get married

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
And

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
And how is the weather

175
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
What's the weather like

176
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
We were trying to

177
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Look back it why was

178
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
That we

179
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Picked a date

180
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Of July

181
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
NGC

182
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Which word where I am

183
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
It is 8

184
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Horrendously

185
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
Oppressive time of the year July in washing

186
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Tamil people

187
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
On a rooftop outside in July in Washington DC

188
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
She's going to be your wedding day

189
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
Annually how hard can it be you're literally throwing a party

190
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
Freddy people like

191
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Like what we need we need

192
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,159
Like a location we really didn't have a place in mind we figured we could find once we sent with

193
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,535
Out the invitations which were invitations were Postcards From the National Zoo that had picked

194
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
Making a sound crazy

195
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
Will give you details when you arrive July 10th

196
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
Location TBD

197
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,735
But it was all in a kind of in the spirit of like we're just going to throw this on party and

198
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
Actually Community around us

199
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
All together and that was the fun

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
That my aunt to live near by relay

201
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Like we're going to go get flowers

202
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
The Farmers Market

203
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Another aunt

204
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
Mine was like I have a friend who lives who has a

205
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,655
There's a rooftop on the top of her building which is a block away from your home

206
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,263
And then there was this Peruvian restaurant near us that we knew kind of served

207
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
ESO

208
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
We want an ass

209
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Ask them and maybe really just

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Figured it out and over the course of three

211
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
And it sounded at this point I'm kind of loving

212
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Sing it like it's like

213
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
First original DIY roof

214
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Top

215
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
You know edgy wedding alternate wedding

216
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
And the only problem was that you know you still watch the news those days

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
To find the weather

218
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
And we should have turned on the news on the Wednesday Buffet

219
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
4

220
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
And saw the weather chart which included

221
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Hundred

222
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
112

223
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,639
He was climbing it was going to be a hundred and 11° on our wedding day

224
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,967
111 degrees did the story

225
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Just gets worse from there it's

226
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
Boiling hot I guess look like they're dying

227
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
We had

228
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
Me notebooks this venue the venue

229
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
Is air conditioning had broken from trying to get the place

230
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Cool

231
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
And as we

232
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
He said it was like a beautiful Peruvian place in

233
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Because you know we have

234
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
A flair for the dramatic I thought that the most

235
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Incredible thing would be

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
If instead of serving the paella that we were serving behind the scenes

237
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,407
If they would bring out the paella when it walk it through the room

238
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,503
Play.

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
So

240
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
My my only horrifying part of my wedding day

241
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
Was turning looking up

242
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
And seeing

243
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
My grandmother's face

244
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
As they walked the steaming plate

245
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Paella by her

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
I mean she was just

247
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,519
Horrified

248
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Steaming fish

249
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
I mean

250
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
He was like oh my God this

251
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Such a colossal

252
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,783
Lobster everyone is so completely uncomfortable there's no air conditioning

253
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Snow cones

254
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
Inspector wants the hell out of there is what they want

255
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,463
And we walked away from that evening being like Oh my God

256
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
I never want to do anything related to wedding

257
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Ever again what a crazy

258
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
History why isn't it

259
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Easier

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
Why isn't there a place to find this

261
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Information I just like

262
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah what it was exactly all the things we we

263
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,383
Thought would be horrible about planning a wedding were until we slam the door

264
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
And never want to think

265
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
So 1980s

266
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Three you are married

267
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087

268
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
DC

269
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
What do you what are you guys doing at

270
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
You're still

00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Smithsonian Carly

272
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
We finish the project

273
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
We all move back to New York

274
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Start grad school

275
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Starcrest

276
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
So you start working on your

277
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Ideas

278
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Projects

279
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
So in the very first semester

280
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm taking this class on interactive media and this new technology that was going to transform the world was

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
CD ROM

282
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,063
A word for a Transformer

283
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
And we

284
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Started

285
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Noodling on this idea that this

286
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,511
Project that Carly has been working on all summer was going to be the largest single largest

287
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303

288
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Collective

289
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
All the different music

290
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
I was going to talk about American history

291
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
And we said that's such a shame that the American audience will never get to see those why don't we see if the Smithsonian will hire us

292
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Mapreduce

293
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383

294
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687

295
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223

And they thought is awesome ID

301
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
We thought they had a budget

302
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Basic crepes

303
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
You guys if you can find someone who pay for it you can do it

304
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
She's already farfetch

305

Two people who know nothing about anything

306
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
And we walked into the Egghead software store and started pulling CD-ROMs off the shelf and writing down the names

307
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
The publishers

308
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647

You know this is not a binding

337
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Contract Masonry tsums

338
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
He said this is a test

339
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
This is just a test

340
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
If you guys had the hot spot

341
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Taxi sign

342
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
And he said let's do it

343
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Wow so you get this money

344
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
And when you start working on this project right away

345
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Yes we like

346
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Basically

347
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Founded a business

348
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
Reviews of our Film School experience

349
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Actually

350
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Emmylou Harris all my class

351
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Everyone

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
We're on board I mean we're Walton school for this and it's something to be able to create a commercial product with the Smithsonian brand

353
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Was exciting

354
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
So you you deliver this

355
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Smithsonian

356
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
And then they make this

357
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
CD-ROM available now

358
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Anna shops

359
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Well so the publisher

360
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
I was actually

361
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Very aggressive

362
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Says about getting the disk

363
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
And no one was really making any money

364
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,919
Pretty quickly we realized that this was not going to be the meeting that's going to change everything

365
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
But this publisher managed

366
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
To get the CD ROM

367
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
OEM bundle

368
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
With every one of the early I'm a

369
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
So if you bought the one of those iMac

370
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Max you got Rd

371
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
And as a result

372
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
You know we got maybe a

373
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
I think it's like a dollar per disk

374
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
That was actually distribute

375
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
So

376
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Kaman Twin Falls

377
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
Yeah I know some millions of bees dead

378
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Crocheting

379
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
Discs of all time because it got bundled with such an easy win

380
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
Yeah

381
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
Turned out to be the sort of launch of our company so you walk

382
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
You work at a project

383
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Like

384
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Some cash

385
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Play with enough cash

386
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Keep the people

387
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
That we had hired

388
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Around at least I think they like

389
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,023
I dropped out of grad school rank of sunlight realize what we have his company now we're going to work on the next project

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Acton

391
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
We were at little

392
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Digital media Studio

393
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
In the middle of this working on the

394
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Project together

395
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
One of the four of the four of us

396
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Friends Michael and Rob

397
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
They sort of said hey guys

398
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,759
I think we should be thinking about and we work well together to think we should be thinking about something doing something that isn't work-for-hire

399
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
You're somebody else

400
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Like something that would

401
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Was yours and you guys would own

402
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Right

403
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
We started brainstorming what can we do

404
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,559
You know cuz our vision was Now to create this multi branded multi-platform content Studio

405
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
And we started looking at the different categories or seen you know sports news entertainment that's all.

406
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Storming

407
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
The leader story makes it sound like

408
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
It was all lies

409
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Dimension on her

410
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
After her horrible experience

411
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Planning her wedding

412
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
The idea was first

413
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
And in reality what happened

414
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
And is

415
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
That

416
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Michael

417
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,487
Actually like hey this guy friend of mine he wants to do so like this all my shopping thing it's slipping lately

418
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
Waited till like registry and

419
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
I think David and I look like

420
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Extended goatee

421
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,263
Oh my God no way weddings know anything about them

422
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,639
Like completely disaggregated like the industry is old-fashioned

423
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
And then of course you have that moment your leg

424
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Right

425
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
It's a disaster

426
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
And it would completely and fundamentally change

427
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
If you introduced

428
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Technology to

429
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
You know there was not an MBA

430
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,375
Our research was going to the magazine store and pulling different categories

431
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Bridal travel

432
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Epicurean

433
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
And we look at these wedding

434
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
With a 400-page assessor understand like

435
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
You decide that you want to do something in contacts

436
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
And

437
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Weddings was

438
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Probably the way to go but what

439
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
What would it

440
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
Be like a minute this is like

441
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
96-97

442
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,999
I mean a website a message board

443
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
So what was it going to be like a way for p

444
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
List their services

445
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
We work on

446
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
People so we thought the best place to start

447
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Pudding

448
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Incredible like

449
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Fresh

450
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
And the only way

451
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Yes

452
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
And so the only way I would agreed

453
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,039
Do this the one who was suddenly I was looked at immediately like

454
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
You're the woman

455
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,927
You're going to be interested in wedding it sounds like the only way I am touching this

456
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Is if we do something

457
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Really really

458
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Like the reason

459
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,447
Access any of the information that was out there when we were planning our wedding is cuz it was written for

460
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
People who work

461
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
Lately

462
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
A different world

463
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
I did not dream about my wedding everyday for my

464
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
When I was born

465
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,223
I did not I wasn't marrying in a traditional way I'm going to have like an Intercultural

466
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Marriage with divorce pads

467
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Every problem there could be

468
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
The wedding was in my way

469
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
And those magazines made you

470
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
You feel like crap

471
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
Yeah they wanted you to quit your job sit with your mommy having bonbons and dream of your big day

472
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
Calling it your big day today

473
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
My friends either were that way like all the women I know were like it was

474
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
At this point

475
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
The 90s

476
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Your hip your

477
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Are forward-looking

478
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
You care about

479
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
Fashion and there's like a whole like a

480
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
It's just had such a different movement among young people

481
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,855
And that wasn't reflected at all it would like the industry that have been left

482
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
Our whole overall attitude in the reason why we

483
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
They called it then.

484
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,023
What is it we wanted our brand to be very

485
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Like alternative

486
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Undifferentiated and not be

487
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
Yeah the kind of traditional cookie cutter

488
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
These are the rules wait

489
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Plan a wedding

490
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
We wanted it to be like dare to do it

491
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
And if you looked at the Landscaping to Brides magazine the garage

492
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Modern Brides 35

493
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
Martha Stewart's like a hot thing

494
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
After 10 years

495
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
We

496
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Didn't know

497
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Which way did

498
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
Eli's Bistro menu

499
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
But also Carly's in a belief in

500
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
The differentiation Orban

501
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,071
That we would be good because I'm waiting for the real world

502
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
And we Define that as

503
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Interracial couple

504
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Interdenominational couple

505
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
Same sex couple

506
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Is your divorce

507
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Second marriages

508
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,479
Is all the stuff that we knew that the traditional media companies couldn't touch in these are the marginal areas

509
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
And we're going to own event declare ownership of

510
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
We also had a really big sense of

511
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
We wanted to be to be a reverend

512
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Because we thought that was sort of attitude only if you want to

513
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
You talk to

514
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Brides and grooms

515
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Not their mother

516
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
You needed a new

517
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
So I'm trying to understand

518
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
If you were to describe this to your grandmother who was

519
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
The part of the paella

520
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,311
Actual wedding would you say basically a magazine

521
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
But it's going to be

522
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
In the computer in the internet

523
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,967
Was is that a fair description of how you were thinking about it

524
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
There were

525
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Yea to component

526
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Which one it was like

527
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
The world's coolest wedding

528
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Mixed

529
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
With a community

530
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
Remember this is on AOL

531
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
So we launched on AOL AOL heads like these

532
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
Message Board in the sky and like sites

533
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
You you partnered with AOL

534
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Well they provided

535
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
This evening

536
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
How did you even get that

537
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
So

538
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
Exactly so Michael are Rainmaker co-founder

539
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
Had an In-N-Out

540
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
Managed to get OC

541
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
An audience with Ted Leo

542
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Who is running between houses

543
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
And I remember we put together this deck

544
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
Practice the presentation Carly Michael Robert like the

545
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Presentation genius

547
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Susan weed

548
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Rental car drive down to Vienna Virginia

549
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
And we had

550
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
This audience

551
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:02,591
And we go through this whole dog-and-pony talk about The Libertine and doing and what we were going to build

552
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
And he looks up

553
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
And he says

554
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
This is got to be the worst business plan

555
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Ever seen

556
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Wow

557
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
And and

558
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
And if you just

559
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
They are just

560
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
Did you propose to make money

561
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Well

562
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
We had gone to that

563
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,328
But he busy said he was like look

564
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
What's a lifetime about how long is an average engine

565
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
So your your average lifetime value of customers 9013

566
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080

Percent error

571
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,624
Every birth if you do your job right and they find the right person you will never have them as a customer again

572
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,952
To this day I credit our co-founder Rob who stood up in

573
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Sad you know

00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
We're going to sell advertise

575
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
And head looks at us and says

576
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096

577
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,448

578

579
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264

The big wigs @aol wound up giving them

629
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
Pretty hefty amount of cash

630
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
Where you got RC financing by 1.6 million

631
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
I think it was our largest instrument that that time to in any contacts

632
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
Ironically though like

633
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,768
Is it really that much money if you have to buy computers for $7,000 each

634
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
Each desktop or you know there was no such thing as open source software so we are paying software licenses

635
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,264
You know there's no we work so hard to find an Office to rent in New York

636
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
What were you doing to build the site

637
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,712
We wanted to make sure that the audience came to our side would see something fresh and you everyday so we

638
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
Treated this like a daily publication like a newspaper

639
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
Ten con ten channels that had to be fresh content

640
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,976
And you know Distributors every single day

641
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280

644
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704

645
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Producing a

646
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
And Publishing

647
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
Content consta

648
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
And who did you get to write the

649
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
I have this connection to

650
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,736
A group of fun really fun Young Writers they were

651
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,856
People who wrote for sassy magazine so really strong attitude

652
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,416
Men and women

653
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
I'll head

654
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Great sense of humor

655
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
When we had that day

656
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Edomite

657
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
My litmus test

658
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,168
Says if they would never ever ever write for a wedding magazine

659
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
Could right for me

660
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,312
The other key piece of that though was really understanding and this we didn't

661
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,896
We didn't know going into it but really realizing how important

662
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Nanjing

663
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Community

664
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
And building out the

665
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Platform of

666
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
The different message boards and how to create connection

667
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
People

668
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
And that is where the certificate

669
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
Explosive what are the early concept

670
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Like social network

671
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
Write how you catch

672
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Crowdsource amazing information

673
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,376
And that's where AOL was the perfect training ground

674
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Because

675
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
The

676
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Assertive

677
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
The gravitational Center of all this stuff we're in their chat room

678
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Wright Tire Anoka

679
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,200
These chat rooms you had to try to turn into these thriving continuous conversation

680
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
And

681
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
We all had to man the chat room

682
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Sweetie we had aliases

683
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Mine was Anya

684
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
And I would sit in this chat room waiting for people to show up and most people tend to just lurk they wanted to hear it and Whatley

685
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Meet other people's conversations

686
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,608
And you had to try to figure out a way to get people engaged

687
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
And so I always have this one thing and I would rather

688
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
How to get people started outside

689
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
My fiance

690
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
Force me to buy a dress two sizes

691
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Too small

692
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,480
And said if I can't fit in the dress on the day of the wedding to not show up

693
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
But you just make this up makeup

694
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Spur conversation

695
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
And boy did was that the fire start the Roomba to explode

696
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,704
An explosion back away and that

697
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Roomba just

698
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Keep going for hours and hours

699
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,872
Mother-in-law always gets

700
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
Ram towing and

701
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,456
Misbehaving bridesmaid

702
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
It's just all about like putting this demons

703
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,784
Play do what it did was

704
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
It taught us

705
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
To listen

706
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
To audience

707
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Yeah

708
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
It did was it was exciting

709
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Making money

710
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Pretty fast

711
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
Through another's AOL

712
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Subscription dollars

713
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
No

714
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
Well if you think about the internet at the time

715
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
Which was

716
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
I mean mostly men

717
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,312
Even in AOL with probably the most women

718
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Have any place on the internet

719
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
And still that was most

720
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
And then

721
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
People getting married since there are only two million of them

722
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
In America at any given

723
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,112
Time you're starting to like get down to very small set of

724
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
People who could even potentially br

725
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,768
But I think those first week I remember Ivar like monthly visitor account

726
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
$15

727
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Riding with 7000

728
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,704
7000 out of 2 million Americans like we've got a long way to go

729
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,544
What we really had to do was go out why our first hire was a sale

730
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
You needed advertise

731
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
In fact one of our first advertisers

732
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:39,552
I think she may have been our first appetizer was Nicole Miller and she had this bridesmaid's dress line

733
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,904
That was cute and she wanted to be marketed as something that you wear again and

734
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
Nicole came to our office and I remember we were showing her the little pieces of art that we

735
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,864
Created that were essentially the first banners in a very little buttons

736
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
We'd sit on the side

737
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,960
And you know Robert explain to her hey you know

738
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,008
People can click on this

739
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
And she said well

740
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
What will my buttons do

741
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
And we realized

742
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
That she didn't have a website

743
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:13,088
And he said very quickly well the link to a catalog

744
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
Yeah we're basically selling

745
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,000
Links and buttons and clicks that were leading to other places that we had

746
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Creeper the app

747
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,656
Which which the advertisement for the advertisers was this new shiny saying that they didn't understand and they were like

748
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,776
I got to assume that time work that high

749
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Right they weren't they weren't

750
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
Paying that much money that time

751
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
They were

752
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
I think our first year total revenues were maybe 70000

753
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah $70,000 member like 71

754
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,112
1.6 million was that

755
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Money was Bernie

756
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
It was almost gone

757
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,024
We were we are rapidly running out of money and

758
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
What's saved us

759
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Was

760
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
We had

761
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
Down a amazing book AJ

762
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
And are you not remember our aspirations was always

763
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,824
Create these multiplan branded platform

764
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
And she actually managed

765
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
To get a

766
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Getting War

767
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,456
Warframe multiple Publishers on a 3 book

768
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Deal for the knot

769
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
And that money

770
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Infusion of cash

771
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
We did we will lived off of bed and bath

772
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
350

773
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Are three books

774
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
And so you put that back in the company

775
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,168
But you need to read books

776
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
Well, we just had our first

777
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,776
Baby until Carly literally came back

778
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
From maternity leave

779
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
All of maybe three weeks

780
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
And I still might the image I still have of her is like

781
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Breastfeeding her daughter

782
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Wild

783
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
Furiously typing rates

784
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Computer because we had to deliver

785
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
The first mange

786
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:57,280
Listen to this my own story go to investors

787
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Private-equity people are

788
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Venture capitalist

789
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Get some money

790
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
We we had

791
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Thought about it

792
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Yes

793
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Where is trying to think of other ways

794
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,080
That would make money business

795
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
And we have this idea and we said you know

796
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,944
The thing that bride seem to be really vexed about

797
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Is this whole registry

798
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Isn't there a way to like

799
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Completely reinvent

800
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Create an online gift

801
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:28,512
You're not taking the internet

802
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
And we said

803
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
This is

804
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:36,192
Got to be the thing we do and that actually prompted us to go try to raise money to build the first online

805
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Remember this is 1997

806
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
So when

807
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Just like the website

808
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
Rio me act like it's

809
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
Super mind-blowing

810
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,040
To think of an online gift registry you have to remember that like

811
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
Nobody even really bought any

812
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
An end so how did you

813
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,720
What did you do that how are you going to make that a real

814
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,072
Yeah that's extremely clear because no one had online

815
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Gift register

816
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
No way to do it we actually

817
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Realize that

818
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Do this

819
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
We would have to

820
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
Get the inventory arcel

821
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
At that time where

822
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
AR

823
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Bride

824
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
Account or whatever we call it our member count

825
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Was really growing

826
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
Hang in a very significant way

827
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
Word of mouth was

828
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
Our only way we were mark

829
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
We didn't spend any money I think was a lot about our brand and our at

830
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,864
Attitude like once you found us you wanted to tell anyone you knew who is getting married about

831
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
And so we were growing in that way like wild

832
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
People really

833
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
Very like loyal and excited about the brand

834
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:50,432
But it still wasn't so when you took the concept of the registry to

835
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
Potential investors what do they say

836
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
It was a really long slog

837
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,880
Economy news hard to raise money for anything that was female-centric

838
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Image of space

839
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
And

840
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
It's a fact that large

841
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
Component of our business would now be predicated on e-commerce

842
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
On top of advertising

843
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:12,192
Pekin the first question people said was like they're not going to give you a credit card number

844
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
People too paranoid about that

845
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
They're not going to register

846
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
Sure they're not going to end and I think

847
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
We will probably wear marketing

848
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
For almost a year

849
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Before we came across

850
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
Adventure capitalist on the West Coast

851
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Said you know what this is

852
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,416
Really interesting and you know we're going to take a flyer on this

853
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
How much money do guys rate

854
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
3 million

855
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,536
We launched the registry

856
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,632
And was it on the night was like the knot.com registry

857
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
And we have a new tab

858
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
And

859
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,776
We certainly saw within I think 3 or 4 months

860
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
We had close 250000 couples Reg

861
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
In our registry

862
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Put that in the context that's more than what Bloomingdale's

863
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Wow

864
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,344
250 thousand people register

865
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
Within the first few months how do they even know about

866
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
About the righteous

867
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
This is actually the critical thing

868
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,072
Where Carly was the the secret weapon

869
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Carly became the person

870
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Cool

871
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
When we publish our first book

872
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Suddenly appeared on The Today Show

873
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:22,592
And became sort of the wedding lifestyle kind of Guru

874
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
Meanwhile not telling the world

875
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,272
The word one about my actual wedding day remember the first time I was on TV a friend of mine was like

876
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
At your wedding

877
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,208
And all of a sudden you're a wedding Guru

878
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Super youth

879
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
Profitable at that point where you still can

880
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,352
Gleaming how are you funding

881
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
The three million

882
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
We meet at last

883
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
But we were

884
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
We we essentially were

885
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,616
Looking to the raise another round and within a year we raised another

886
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Also known in our office had Aeron chair

887
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,296
It's like everything was Ikea or hand me down or I mean we didn't

888
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,856
We sort of that that whole culture of the

889
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,976
The internet companies now

890
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Does he know you were lucky if you got a

891
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,584
Pizza for you guys nervous at all

892
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
And you have

893
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Tomorrow kid

894
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
You will not

895
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Making any money

896
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Because she pretty

897
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Just funding is coming

898
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
You guys are probably

899
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
Learning nothing

900
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,480
If I remember correctly with seemed kind of unfair and exorbitant like

901
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,320
We shouldn't be taking his money and he did you ever have conversations

902
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
You know at night where you were like

903
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Maybe it's just like

904
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,512
Go to law school or something like that you ever were you totally

905
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Princess was going to workout

906
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
I don't think we felt we had enough

907
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
You know

908
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
We had BFA

909
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,008
Unemployable so we had to make this thing

910
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
Super this point you guys

911
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
You got the gift registry going

912
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
And things seem to be having a lot of gas and then

913
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
In in mm you decide to

914
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
To take the company public on the NASDAQ

915
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm assuming this is to raise more cash

916
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
Yes so in 99 we actually had just raise money to build

917
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,632
Doubt in flush out the registry raise 15 million dollars and

918
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
Literally week later weird

919
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Approached by Bank

920
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Too sad

921
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Are the windows going to close you need to go public

922
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,336
And and we were

923
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
Fresh money in the bank and I couldn't understand why there was such a

924
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Are we took their advice

925
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Fortunately and

926
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,576
Are we then I think 7 months of that meeting we were going public

927
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
December

928
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Second

929
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
1999 Republic

930
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
The entire internet world collapses 4 months later

931
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,584
You're really lucky to have that additional 35 million dollars

932
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
So you ate when you went public

933
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Erase 35 million more dollars

934
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
And then four months later the dotcom crash

935
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Does that do anything to your

936
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
We never had the

937
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,920
Super spiky jump and we didn't have a super

938
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
Cataclysmic crash it just over the course of a year and a half

939
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
Went from $20

940
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
And settle down

941
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,136
226

942
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
So people lost

943
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Stuffed shirts

944
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
Yeah presumably you guys had

945
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
A lot of shares to

946
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
We were not allowed to sell lemonade

947
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,448
We we were locked up in by the time the 6-month lock up with Head released

948
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
Honestly we're also

949
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,152
We were way too loyal and dedicated we did not want there to be any indication that the founders had lost faith in

950
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,480
And so we were going to hold on to the bloody

951
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
$20

952
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
26 Cents of a year-and-a-half

953
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Must have

954
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Ben

955
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
Rapha meaning must have been

956
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,464
Market analysts and people even in the industry were saying this this company make me laugh

957
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,024
OU's horrific but we had our competitors

958
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Faxing or stock chart

959
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,680
To our advertisers saying look what's happening they're going out of business really want to give him now

960
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
And did that did that

961
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
In any way affect

962
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
You know how much money you had to spit

963
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
If you had to

964
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
To use like a Drifter

965
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,688
Did you just fire people just to lay people off

966
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
At that time or or we could you

967
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Still kind of played along

968
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:19,904
We we never had layoffs we always we're able to downsize to attrition but we never formally had to leave

969
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
People often because we are always running relatively lean

970
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
And they were people who panicked and and

971
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Basically

972
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Should have got out

973
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
Jurassic the biggest challenge was controlling the like psychology of

974
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
Your team bet

975
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
Your advertisers did not do

976
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,032
Understand the distinction

977
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Between

978
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
You're growing Revenue

979
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
And how they had nothing to do with your stuff

980
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Play so between your young staff

981
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
Who also is looking like member those

982
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,184
Options are underwater by about $9 or

983
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
And RNN advertise

984
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
Kaiser said it was so much

985
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Emotion control heading that way

986
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Was the hardest part

987
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,680
Key people focus and it was exhausting and also you do go home at night and you were like

988
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
Remember when we were asked

989
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Going to walk away from the

990
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,776
Disney

991
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,872
30 million dollars together and now we have

992
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
Electronic stores it doesn't seem worth it because it seemed where they were definitely a moment we feel like

993
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Exhaust

994
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
The low point

995
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,832
It was the summer of 2001

996
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Square

997
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
The stock drop below dollar for

998
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
Over 90 days

999
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
You get the listed

1000
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Are we going to go longer than you

1001
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,936
Go down to the sea in bed now sector-3 considering the

1002
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,776
And I still remember there's a little tribunal you make your case and then

1003
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
This Old Gentleman looks over and says

1004
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:49,248
I'm sorry you know we're still going to have to do list you but you have a great little business don't let it that

1005
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,832
When you get delisted you you still you're still a stock right

1006
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:59,488
You still start your trading in the bulletin boards but the key difference is now the major

1007
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,864
Funds are no longer allowed to hold yourself you are listed you cannot so big fun tonight

1008
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:10,752
Yeah the fidelities and unfortunately you know that's where a lot of volume in the sport comes

1009
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,080
From Republic socks and so the moment we got Dlisted

1010
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
2 million shares just

1011
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
Automatically gets injected into the

1012
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,320
We went down from like $0.90 to $0.26

1013
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:29,952
You have to be above a dollar for certain number of months

1014
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,048
To get realistic about $5

1015
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
480 days

1016
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Without Institution

1017
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,704
Once you're Dlisted it's almost impossible to

1018
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
Get back on it cuz you'd have to

1019
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,080
Convince people individuals to buy shares right

1020
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Exactly

1021
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
Sew-in in the back

1022
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
I spent the next

1023
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
3 years

1024
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Going to

1025
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Dentist investor club meetings

1026
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
If the back of the Red Lion Inn

1027
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,416
Going to small-cap going to conferences

1028
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:05,792
Drumming of retail support to try to get the stock

1029
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
So you had to get individual investors

1030
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Buy shares

1031
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,544
Yeah you need it to dentists in America

1032
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080
It was and I think

1033
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,432
You know that's when you put on like 25 lb

1034
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
I have this one meeting with a competitor and I think

1035
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,320
It he said these fatal words that I've had sooner

1036
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Propel this thing forward

1037
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:36,000
Baby saw this as an opportunity to acquire us and they said listen you have a broken IPO we should just put these companies

1038
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,400
Together you know 7030 their way we will continue to repackage it and go public

1039
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
This is an offer to buy you out

1040
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Yes and he said cuz

1041
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
Your Dlisted

1042
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:52,128
And giving relisted is like carrying a gorilla up 30 flights of stairs then pause

1043
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
It's too hard

1044
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
And I remember the day we got relisted in

1045
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
2005

1046
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,855
Dying to send him a postcard with a big gorilla on it saying 30 flights delivered take that

1047
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
So

1048
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
4 years

1049
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
You're awesome as.

1050
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
It's a long time

1051
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
I'm trying to figure out why you didn't just

1052
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Cut your losses

1053
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Didn't say

1054
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
We're still young you know we can still kind of

1055
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
Try something else out

1056
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
This is knocking

1057
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
It's not going to be the way that we're going to make

1058
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Sustainable life

1059
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
I think

1060
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
It was because we will never doing it for the money

1061
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
Who did you hire kids you needed

1062
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Have somebody

1063
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Yeah but I think it was

1064
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
I think it was the war

1065
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,815
We were launching a TV show we were launching you know a national magazine there's so many really excite

1066
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Writing things that we were building you know the nest

1067
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
The bump came last in the bump were like

1068
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
The next iterations messed obvious

1069
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Play about

1070
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
Is in your home

1071
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
And the bump about baby

1072
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
Yeah our audience have been begging us

1073
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
That's four years to take

1074
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
Take them beyond the wedding day and we

1075
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
You know people on our staff who would like grown Beyond The Wedding phase and I'll head babies they all wanted to launch it so it's just him in crib

1076
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
It'll be fun there was so much more to do

1077
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
We always said to each other like

1078
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
If it ever becomes

1079
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Super boring

1080
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
We should get out

1081
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
We were not particularly like

1082
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,679
Planner people anyway wouldn't think about our

1083
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Future

1084
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,007
We were just thinking

1085
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Exit wasn't part of a rectangular

1086
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,615
You get relisted in in 05

1087
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
You've been launched the nest

1088
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
And the bump

1089
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
I miss part of the

1090
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,039
The hold to the media Empire you're working on a bunch of different projects

1091
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
At what point

1092
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
Were you

1093
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,135
Did you guys feel like okay

1094
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
We've turned a corner like we are

1095
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,999
Where can I be okay not work anymore

1096
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,583
I'm not sure there yet

1097
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
Once we were like prophet

1098
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Butterball

1099
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
Keep thinking you're ahead and then

1100
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,031
Enjoy having your own back

1101
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,103
Keep pushing again in 2006

1102
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,919
Send 7 we wound up we we

1103
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
Bought Wedding Channel

1104
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
There is

1105
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,367
Unbelievable so frothy expectations and what that acquisition was going to net us in

1106
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,975
Stock hits $32 we have a billion dollar market cap and

1107
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
Dino Dan precipitates

1108
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
The next

1109
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:23,423
You know minor nuclear winter wear the socks or declining down to do so you just can't live up to those expectations

1110
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
And then

1111
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
2008 Honda

1112
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,823
The Great Recession stock price

1113
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,943
I was talking to held up relatively well I think we're most media companies

1114
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
Spore down 20% we grew 5%

1115
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
You know we actually

1116
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
Do that year because

1117
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
A lot of the marketers realize that the only people

1118
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
Who are going to continue to spend money during this Great Recession are our rights and rims

1119
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Weddings were truly recession

1120
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
But what do you think it is about

1121
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
About your personality essay

1122
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Work so well together because

1123
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
You guys went through such

1124
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,103
Intense emotional highs and lows building this business so

1125
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
What do you think it was about

1126
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
The other person there in a relation

1127
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:13,855
This is where you declare your love of me and how amazing I have

1128
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Exactly

1129
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
You know I think we were

1130
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
Ultimately so different as people

1131
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
I wouldn't say that

1132
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
We necessarily work well together

1133
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
But we were in

1134
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
Credibly complimentary

1135
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,703
Where there is no overlap there's

1136
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
Less conflict in a time when there was overlap oh my God it was like

1137
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,127
Like the two of us are both incredibly bullheaded

1138
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,711
There are really distinct differences like David can kind of

1139
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Look up

1140
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
Look ahead and think of something

1141
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Like really bold and

1142
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Teejet way down the road

1143
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
I can grab that ball really

1144
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
Quickly believe in it

1145
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
Like I'm not a naysayer

1146
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
Okay you want to do that

1147
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
And then I figured out how to

1148
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
When you think about

1149
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
The fact that you both have

1150
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,007
Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts

1151
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,311
You met in a long time ago and

1152
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
You probably will never going to

1153
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,431
100% of traditional path never really going to

1154
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Make a whole lot of money

1155
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,271
The fact that you built a country that's now I guess

1156
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Word collect

1157
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Half a billion dollars

1158
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,183
Like weird now that you look back on it

1159
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Yeah okay

1160
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
That makes sense

1161
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
We we can do this

1162
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
If it's

1163
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Cereal I mean at one point someone said

1164
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,959
Do you realize 700 families are gainfully employed because of what you build

1165
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
And then you know the

1166
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
Sending kids to college and buy homes in next week

1167
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
I thrive and there's a great sense of satisfaction

1168
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
Company has always been good just lyrics

1169
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Extension of our family

1170
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
There's a great deal of

1171
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:55,743
Pride in having been able to build something that is sustainable in and continue to grow that way

1172
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
We never really

1173
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Care that much about money

1174
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,119
But I can tell you nothing worried about money

1175
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,447
That is like that is what I'm so great

1176
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
I spell panic

1177
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,799
Yeah but that's like a personality

1178
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Disorder

1179
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Kill all the people

1180
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
I think more than anybody else

1181
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
Your business

1182
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,599
Billy reflects the progression of your adult life and where I love that is

1183
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:28,255
You you clearly did all these very imperfectly like your wedding was kind of a disaster and then

1184
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,559
You know you kind of struggled with

1185
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,631
Kids because you were busy or didn't probably

1186
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
Do everything that all the perfect parents were doing and

1187
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,031
All these companies that use Darden deflect all the things that you

1188
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Done in your life

1189
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
And I think

1190
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Almost

1191
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Event you know

1192
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
More to the point

1193
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,527
Our whole set of Brands going to celebrate a damn perfect

1194
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
I think what

1195
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
Appeal the p

1196
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
People is that

1197
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,719
We're like there is no perfect there are some parents

1198
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Seducing perf

1199
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,327
I'm not friends with any of them

1200
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
And when I picked up

1201
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Carly from the house

1202
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Go with our daughter

1203
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
I really don't watch it, it's there now go ahead

1204
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
NR used Honda

1205
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,871
Where are our friend I've come to help and we had

1206
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Abandon the little

1207
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
Car seat in the back and as we're driving back from Mount Sinai

1208
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
A friend asks

1209
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,927
If we stopped at a stoplight and there's like a CVS or Duane Reade outside

1210
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
Neighbors are like

1211
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Right diaper

1212
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,399
Anythink

1213
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
Oh my God I think it also made us could disappear

1214
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,591
Because I think

1215
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
We never walk around with a hubris

1216
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
No and notion that we knew better

1217
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
And that the process of Discovery in the process

1218
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Learning hat was

1219
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Constant

1220
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
A team effort

1221
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135
Yeah and I think

1222
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
You know we would never be in a position to help my God we know exactly how things are in wedding should be done or houses and pregnancy be done

1223
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
When we learned it that you know by the seat of my pants and

1224
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
We embrace the people who are courageous enough to do that as well I mean a lot of entrepreneurs

1225
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Have like

1226
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,311
A spouse who will let you know.

1227
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Teach music lesson

1228
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Beside or

1229
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,455
You know we'll be school teacher or a lawyer or have some kind of income coming in like

1230
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,247
You guys did not have a plan B

1231
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
Cuz you're both in this

1232
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
Now this is the high wire

1233
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,879
Yaldo I think back like

1234
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
I would have hated to be married

1235
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
An entrepreneur

1236
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
One you're like

1237
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Never see

1238
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
And they're just totally stressed out

1239
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,887
And I think that it was

1240
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Super super stretch

1241
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Full

1242
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Like really

1243
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Dangerous

1244
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,615
Painful and complicated and so many ways and it was the most

1245
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:57,759
Romantic amazing exciting exhilarating thing on the other side and it was literally both

1246
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,551
Like you're building something

1247
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,903
From scratch and it was like

1248
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,719
In the thick of it on your hiring these people or something

1249
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
So exciting to be doing it together Carley Roney and David Liu founders

1250
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
The knot

1251
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Since 2011 lyrics

1252
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
Expanded their Lifestyles empires not called

1253
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
The XO group

1254
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823
And it includes a site about

1255
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,359
Pregnancy called the bump

1256
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
What about home decor call the nest and a website called how he asked which is a marriage proposal planner

1257
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Hutu

1258
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
In 2014 David and Carly both step down from the day-to-day running of EXO

1259
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Which means

1260
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
What time do the kids

1261
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,815
For hanging out with friends and never according to Carly

1262
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Ever

1263
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375

Hey thanks so much

1283
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,703
For sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1284
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,031
Turn up the volume on your device

1285
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
For just a second

1286
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,615
Play the sound for you it's sick

1287
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,175
I know the subtle but I think you'll know what

1288
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:37,087
Poke a needle scratching

1289
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,719
Hang on vinyl which is a kind of a cool sound right full of romance and anticipation

1290
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Especially if

1291
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,559
If you grew up with it and even

1292
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
If you didn't

1293
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
I started

1294
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,959
Being really a student records when I was a kid I would go through my parents record collections and

1295
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,055
Play Herb Alpert has Creedence Clearwater Revival

1296
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,871
In the late 1980s when Mike Dixon was growing up.

1297
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
In Wichita Falls TX

1298
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Then I just

1299
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,759
Was always fascinated with the fact that you had to really interact

1300
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:11,391
Music in a physical way to pull the record out of the sleeve put it on the turntable and play it

1301
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:17,279
Is Michael older he started hanging out in clubs and recording some of his friends band

1302
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,863
And a lot of them wanted to put their songs on vinyl because

1303
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,191
As we've already established by those kind of cool

1304
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,287
But to cut a vinyl record at a legitimate pressing class

1305
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
Is expensive

1306
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,943
Your general investment was about $2,000 and if you can sell

1307
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
500 copies Euro

1308
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
Definitely not going to break even

1309
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
Last time Mike discovered that if you just want to do a really limited run of Records like say

1310
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,511
A 20 or 30 you can learn to do it yourself

1311
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:55,167
With something called a record lathe a record Lee it's basically looks like a large turntable and the needle is

1312
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
Vibrating is the disc turns underneath it and the sound wave is etched into the disc

1313
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,687
Old record labels in recording studios or radio stations in the 1940s and 50

1314
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:11,807
And you can still find them usually in a Dusty Attic or of course

1315
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
EBay

1316
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
I got really obsessed with the machines

1317
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
I've bought everyone that I could find and eventually I had so many machines I was having

1318
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,351
Bands from out of town come over to my kitchen

1319
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,703
And cut record straight to the Lay's in the other room

1320
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
The drummer would be

1321
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
Right next to the sink

1322
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,895
The guitar player and bass player would be next to the refrigerator

1323
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
And I would be

1324
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,991
Getting the records while they play the song

1325
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,319
Anyway this is all happening in Olympia Washington

1326
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:48,927
And 2010-2011 and I should mention that in real life

1327
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
Mike was teaching High School

1328
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:57,375
But he's also got this vinyl record label going and eventually he moves out of the kitchen and into

1329
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
To a studio and then into the world to small events and pop-up festivals where he

1330
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,615
Uses his portable record lathe to Cut vinyl on the spot

1331
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:14,015
And then in 2012 Mike and his partner got a phone call we got a call from

1332
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:20,415
Converse about cutting records for Bank of the XX at their Coachella VIP party

1333
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
What's a Coachella

1334
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
Huge execs also pretty huge and family Mike and his partner Chris are at the big party

1335
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:34,239
With to record lathe making vinyl dubs of Jamie XX for like 200

1336
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,639
The attendees would go and listen to some samples and they say I want the song of the ace I want the song of the

1337
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,199
B-side and then we would cut it for them right there

1338
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
And then they walk away with

1339
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
A disk they can take home and play and show their friends

1340
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:57,535
Hate I want this in my party I need this my activation or at my Festival

1341
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,655
Mobile vinyl recorders be quitting teaching job he moved to Tucson Arizona

1342
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:09,055
And now he and Chris do about one event a month making vinyl record dubs festivals parties

1343
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:15,455
People making about a quarter of a million dollars in Revenue doing quite possibly

1344
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
Coolest job ever

1345
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:22,879
It's something that I fell into and yeah I can't imagine having a cooler job either
