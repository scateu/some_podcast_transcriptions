Of manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing which is this product has to be very durable

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Something like

95

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Percent of all professional sports teams in the US

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
Use them and was amazing but the concept is that the inventor and founder of the company Randy hetrick

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Literally needed something to help him stay fit during long deployments as a Navy SEAL

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,496
Who is back in 1997 and at the time

57
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
Randy and his Seal Team we're on a mission to find pirates in Southeast Asia

58
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,968
We were a little Warehouse kind of waiting to see

59
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,576
You know what was going to happen and a day turned into a week turn into a couple weeks

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
And you

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
You don't really have a a good way to

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Train other than

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
Stuff that the Romans did in the way back you know push-ups and

64
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Squats and sit-ups

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
None of that

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Get you

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Really prepared

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Climb the side of a freighter with

69
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
You know 80 pounds of gear on your back

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
And I had accidentally.

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
Deployed with

72
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,896
My Jiu-Jitsu belt stuffed into my bag and scooped it up off my cage

73
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
Yeah well flight suit and thrown into a bag

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Without realizing I had it in

75
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
As I was sitting there on this car

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
Listening to guys gripe about not being able to workout

77
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
I just got this idea that hey I wonder if I went

78
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Tied a knot

79
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
The end of this silly belt that I do

80
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Deploy herewith

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Threw it over the top of that door over there

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
What if I could lean back

83
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
And then pull my body up

84
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
And I just kind of created this movement that looked a lot like

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Climbing the ladder and then figured out how to use my body weight

86
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
To load it up

87
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
And that was you know that was the spark of inspiration

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
And you just found like some doors in this Warehouse

89
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
To you

90
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Connected to

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
The first one was actually a bathroom door

92
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
And yeah I just

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
Tied a knot in the end of it threw it over the top of the door close the door

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Then lean back

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
I started to lift my body weight

96
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Against Gravity

97
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Which turns out to be

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Pretty effective I'm pretty versatile

99
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
See what I'm grabbing the ends of this

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Spike

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Jiu jitsu belt engine

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Doing pull-ups in

103
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
Imagine that you had something looks like

104
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Upside down y

105
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Write up

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
An anchor and that goes up over the top of the door

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
And then kind of two arms

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,551
That come off of that cuz I Stitch the the two pieces together with his hand all that

109
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Used to repair

110
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Rubber boats with

111
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
And you know just lean back

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
Grab each side and started figuring out here when I can

113
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
Rose icon

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Can do curls

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,399
Shoulder flys if I turn around and lean away from the door I can

116
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Work the whole front side of my body

117
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Chest presses

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Chest flyes

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
No standing planks for my core and then

120
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,663
Use it as a balance point to do squats and single leg squats

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Lunges and it just

122
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
China became like a

123
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Flower

124
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
The continued to open up and expose new pedals

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
You know the more that I worked with

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
When you started to drink

127
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Do these exercises in

128
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Men's Wearhouse

129
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
Waiting for a mission to begin what are the other

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Members of Seal Team

131
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Think about it

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Well I mean

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
You got to realize it's a group of

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
Pack alpha males so the first thing they do is come over and mock you

135
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Try to say what the heck

136
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
And then then very quickly

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
It'll seals are innovative

138
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Cats and when it comes to

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
You know exercise

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
Everybody sort of interested in so literally

141
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Yoga

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
We try that we see

143
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
If we do this can we do this and

144
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
You know over the course of

145
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
The next Maybe

146
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
3-6 months

147
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
I just kept tweaking it and you know guys would have ideas on

148
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Hey maybe we should put Loops in the air

149
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
An advanced at some level but then it kind of froze

150
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
At the level that I thought it needed to be

151
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Because I never viewed this

152
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
I wasn't thinking about business

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
I just thought it was kind of cool that I created this

154
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Nifty tool

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
That guy's

156
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
You know light

157
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
And wanted and so I had to

158
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
A friend who was a parachute rigger out in

159
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Apparel off to

160
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Started making them

161
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Four guys in exchange for a case of beer

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,375
And you call me and say you know a boss you know Jones wants me to make one your gizmos

163
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Not okay

164
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Can I see a gopher

165
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
And over the course of a couple years it just

166
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Proliferate within that

167
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Unit

168
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
So when did you start to think a maybe yeah you know

169
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Well I I was promoted out of the field

170
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
And at that point

171
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
My wife was

172
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
We sort of done with

173
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
The superhero

174
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,999
Gone all the time lifestyle and had a promotion out to the West Coast

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
In her career and so we kind of had a deal that

176
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
I would apply to

177
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Business school at Stanford

178
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
And if I got in then I would

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Resign my commission and

180
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Yeah I move out there

181
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
And I thought that was

182
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
At that point the safest bet on Earth cuz I hadn't had math and

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
25 years I wasn't very good at it

184
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Back then

185
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
But to my astonishment

186
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,599
They took me in spite of my scores 2001

187
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Yeah

188
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
And I went out there and while I was at Stanford

189
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,839
I was able to go out and train in the athlete training center and I would show up with my straps and hook him up

190
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
When is world class training facility

191
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Over the course of six or eight months

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
I mean darn near every one of the coaches

193
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
That would be in there with her team

194
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Came over in

195
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And said hey

196
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
Tell me about this thing you know in 10 minutes later they be selling me on

197
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
What a great idea it would be for there

198
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Every every one of their athletes

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
90 lb female tennis players that are 300 pound lineman

200
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
And that was when I started to think

201
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
I wonder

202
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
I wonder if

203
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
I can do something with this

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Yep and

205
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
I ended up deciding to take

206
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Summer

207
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Between my first and second

208
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
Year and instead of going off and doing some cushy

209
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
You know paying internship with

210
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
McKenzie

211
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
I bought a $50 40 year old sewing machine off

212
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Gary Street Somerville old sewing shop and

213
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
Sat down in my garage you know I knew how to sew

214
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Because as a young seal officer you had to

215
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Go out and

216
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,207
You know buy a case of beer for the rigor and have him teach you how to sew so you can customize your gear

217
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
And so I so I had some rudimentary sewing skills and

218
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
And I just

219
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,679
You know started creating some different versions of the prototypes and optimizing the design

220
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
And what were you making it out of

221
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
At that time

222
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Nylon

223
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
You know Cordura nylon that I would buy

224
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
Bits of Hardware that I needed and not

225
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
You put put the thing together

226
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
And so that's summer you you were just

227
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
Basically sewing up a bunch of

228
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Different versions of it or you were just

229
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Making the same thing over and over and over again

230
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
No I probably did 50 different versions

231
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
And it it seems funny

232
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
Right when you think of all the things just a darn strap

233
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
But

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
There's a lot of different ways you can make a strap

235
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Zout and

236
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
You know I'd make it night

237
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
I try it out

238
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,823
Alright that's a little better but that caused some unintended consequence that I don't like so I'd work around that

239
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
And I do have any money

240
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
So

241
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
You know I probably spent

242
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,295
I don't know as much time with a razor blade my hand stripping the pieces back apart so that I didn't have to

243
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Yeah reorder them as I did so in them

244
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Together

245
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
But over time you know you swear to workout

246
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
The Kinks and by the time that I got to my

247
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
2nd year in Business School

248
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
I had

249
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
Stabilized prototype

250
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
And I also during that

251
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Summer I had gone over and found a

252
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
A guy over in Hong Kong

253
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
The manufacturing rep who would make

254
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
A short

255
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Lot

256
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Formerly of alpha prototypes

257
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
So you

258
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
You get to that summer

259
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,271
And you get back to school in the fall and what did you do to do like bring it to

260
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Classmates

261
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
Said business school and say hey

262
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
How are you been tested

263
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
I became

264
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
You know a bit of a fanatic

265
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
With my idea

266
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
And I mean anybody who was at Stanford Business School between

267
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
2001

268
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Get out 2004 will tell you I remember that cat

269
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
You know cuz I

270
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
I snuck her

271
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
Everybody in on every class project

272
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
That got assigned I turned into a

273
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Incubator if you will

274
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
4

275
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
What would become TRX

276
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
And

277
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
You know we had event sometimes

278
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
On Fridays the blow off steam they were

279
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Liquidity preference functions

280
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Which basically meant

281
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Tapping a keg

282
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
And hanging out together and I would

283
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
Bring out mice traps and get people on them

284
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,143
It was this great incubator where I learned all kinds of stuff

285
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
And it was one extended Focus Group

286
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
That taught me a lot about

287
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
You know what people liked

288
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
And didn't like about this contraption that I

289
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Was proposing to sell

290
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
You

291
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
But you graduate from Stanford

292
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
And and what do you just

293
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
You decide

294
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
I'm going to launch this thing

295
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Yeah by that point I had

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
You know I had my mindset that I was going to take

297
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
The run at this

298
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
And I was a little old

299
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
To be in a Riesen

300
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
Graduate of a business school program I was the granddaddy of my class by about

301
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
I don't know for 6 years his you are what

302
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
3636

303
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
And so I figured I had one

304
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
Opportunity to try

305
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
Fail before I had to get serious about

306
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
You know of a paying job

307
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
You know my mentors at Stanford

308
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
It's time we're trying to convince me

309
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Going to do something more sensible

310
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
This is just a

311
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Stupid idea

312
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
Well I mean it at the time Garth saloner was

313
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,607
Was one of my end up becoming the dean there he was one of my professors and he said you know Randy I can

314
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
I can get you

315
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Any number

316
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
Great paying jobs in Silicon Valley

317
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
With your background don't do this

318
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
But I I swear that

319
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
I have my headset on it

320
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
And so I got out

321
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Kind of want to ask

322
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
So how did you even have the money to

323
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
To start to manufacture these into 2

324
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Build a company

325
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
What I didn't have any

326
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
Because you know my my career is a government servant

327
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Hadn't produced the giant pile of wealth

328
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
That you would have Oak

329
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
But I did have had about fifty Grand

330
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
In savings and I put it all in

331
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
Canada First Steps the initial prototypes and then

332
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
I'm pursuing a little bit of

333
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Guangzhou property

334
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Which thank goodness

335
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Hop PK

336
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Really important

337
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Even recently

338
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
What did you do did you

339
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Did you just file a bunch of

340
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Patents for for this

341
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
Characteristics in those designs that that I had created that

342
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
I thought were

343
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
Really special and

344
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Fundamentally

345
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Differentiate

346
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
This product

347
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
From what if I was successful as expected

348
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
You know I heard of

349
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Copy

350
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Cats

351
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
And so I went

352
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Patented those unique features

353
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
And then I file some trademarks on Kennedy

354
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Key

355
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Terminology

356
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
That I was going to try to build our brand around

357
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
Brandon was one of the concepts that I

358
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
I really learned

359
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Stanford

360
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
2 in 2005

361
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
When you launch the company

362
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
Tell me how you started to get the word out about

363
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Update the system because this was not

364
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Really liked it out

365
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
How did you get people to

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Take you seriously

367
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
Well I think a lot of people didn't take me seriously initially

368
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
But I I did it in sort of the

369
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
You're the least sexy way possible

370
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Hydro

371
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,015
Around initially around Northern California in my car with my wingman blueberry my dog

372
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
In the passenger seat in a backpack full of straps

373
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
And I went Jim to gym to gym to gym

374
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
Doing these little presentations to their staff

375
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Trainers

376
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
And I would usually have to

377
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
You know bags of Fitness manager to give me

378
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,007
Half hour of their weekly in-service with her staff and then I would leave a couple of straps behind

379
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
I'll bet you that I did in the first couple of years after

380
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Business school I probably did

381
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,967
23 + 500 presentations around the country

382
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,807
And you would get the Skeptics for sure a lot of the big dudes that

383
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,903
Yeah we're used to throwing around a lot of weight they would swear to look at me like a

384
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
You know what is what is this

385
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
This little girly machine that you got here

386
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
But I would quickly

387
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
Disabuse them of the belief that it wasn't for them

388
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
And then after that right people would sort of

389
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
Be interested in I would leave a couple behind

390
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,079
And it was just you know one gym at a time one trainer at a time

391
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
Started to make a little progress

392
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,831
Are you getting a lot of orders in the first year first two years

393
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,207
Well I mean a lots of relative thing right from 0-10 is a lot

394
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
And so yeah I started

395
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
I started to get what I viewed as a lot

396
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
It was Signs of Life

397
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
And I was fulfilling them out of this this really

398
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Can a pathetic little

399
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Almost a shed that I was renting out in the

400
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Western edge of the sunset

401
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Street in San Francisco

402
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
And I would

403
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
Do you know I was everything I would fulfill them

404
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
I had a little inkjet printer and was running the

405
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
The enterprise software out of a desktop

406
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
My feet

407
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
And then you know then I met

408
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
A gal who

409
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
Was a waitress by night but

410
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,511
Would help me with the office stuff by day

411
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
And I we just started to

412
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
Plug away and ship out of everything happened out of that little 1500 square foot shop out of

413
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
The sunset

414
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
What was it

415
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
What was the turning point when did you

416
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Start to

417
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Feel like this thing is

418
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Really

419
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
What happened

420
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
It's funny how people talk about Tipping Point

421
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
My experience is a little different I think

422
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
It's kind of a series of tipping points that

423
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
You know they get

424
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
Relatively bigger if you're fortunate overtime but

425
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
One of the early ones was I went down to a

426
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
Do a trade show down in San Diego

427
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Call The Idea World Fitness convention

428
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
And I

429
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
Shut up

430
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
10 by 10 booth down there and I had this

431
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Can a fake door that I had put together and

432
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
The Anchorage

433
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
And we ended up selling out of everything we had

434
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
Well and I had to have my assistant

435
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Overnight me

436
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
You know what we have left

437
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Shop

438
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,903
There to the second day of the shows at three day show the second day I was basically selling paper futures

439
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
And then

440
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Thank goodness the product arrived on the third day in the people

441
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Coming exchange their paper for

442
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Four straps

443
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
And that was a big moment because I realized all right

444
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
These trainers are a skeptic

445
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
But if they think this is really a great thing

446
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
All right

447
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Now I'm

448
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
I'm cooking with some gas you know

449
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
And so that was kind of

450
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,479
Tipping Point one and then shortly thereafter I started to get exposed to some athlete

451
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
And ended up connecting with a cat that probably most of your blisters

452
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
I've heard of name Drew Brees very early and I and his crew

453
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
So before he became the

454
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
Super Bowl champion quarterbacks

455
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
Before he became the Drew Brees that we all know today I mean he was the same guy then but

456
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
You just didn't know about him

457
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
And he hadn't had just torn his

458
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Is rotator cuff in his throwing

459
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Shoulder

460
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,799
Which quarterbacks tends to be a career-ender

461
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
And he had just been released from

462
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
The Chargers

463
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
And was doing rehab

464
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
And he fell in love with the suspension

465
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
Wow thank goodness and so did that

466
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Was that

467
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Would started to get a lot of attention

468
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
440 system

469
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
What he ended up

470
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
But when he went to New Orleans

471
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
He ended up saying to me you don't hate Randy give me

472
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
You'll have to ask me these I'll take him with me

473
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
And

474
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
You know I'll see if I can get the Saints to start raining

475
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,007
And he had a opportunity with Sports Illustrated

476
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Early on to do a story about his comeback

477
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
And he

478
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Was very kind and

479
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
You know just a sort of scratch my back

480
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Make sure that

481
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
The picture that they featured was him training on the suspension

482
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
And all the sudden

483
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
All the strengths

484
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Conditioning coaches and athletes

485
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Sweets that reads Sports Illustrated

486
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Got their eyes on this crazy strap

487
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Havoc

488
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
You know the Big Challenge

489
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
For somebody who's starting

490
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Adventure

491
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Quickly if you got a

492
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Product for which there isn't

493
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
President

494
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
The big challenges obscurity

495
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
And trying to get

496
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Out of obscurity

497
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
And get up on the

498
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
On the radar

499
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
When you don't have

500
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Much money

501
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Very challenging

502
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
And

503
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
At first you think that's

504
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,135
Yeah Boi once we once we break out

505
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
It'll just all be Duck Soup

506
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
From that point forward you know what I was I was envisioning

507
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Napping on piles of hundred dollar bills

508
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
But it didn't quite work out that way because as soon as you start to hit scale

509
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Then a hole

510
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Other host

511
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,287
Of challenges begins to Avail themselves

512
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
And you have to Wrangle each one wanted

513
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
Time don't like like what for

514
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
One of the specific challenge

515
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Is that

516
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Pie Face early was

517
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,087
The manufacturer that I had started with who was a good guy

518
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
But didn't have a depth

519
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Of

520
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
Manufacturing experience in kind of product that I was bringing

521
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
Which is this product a speaker durable

522
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
It's a one of the

523
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Very early large

524
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Lots of inventory we ordered

525
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Arrived

526
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
And

527
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,799
Yeah we sold out of everything so we're out of stock by the time it arrived

528
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
And desperate to ship

529
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,455
What we hooked up the first suspension trainer lean back and the handles

530
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Just cracked like potato chips and

531
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
It turns out that this manufacturer

532
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
Had gone to a sub manufacturer

533
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
And found somebody who would do

534
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,743
The subcomponents more cheaply

535
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
And

536
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Had mentioned this

537
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
And we didn't have time to send this stuff back and so we ended up having to manually strip these things apart set up an

538
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,287
Basically an assembly line with a bandsaw went and got

539
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,591
A bunch of Plumbing

540
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Pipe from

541
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Home Depot

542
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
And literally had to set up this little

543
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
Yelp Manufacturing

544
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,831
Plant if you will in our little office there

545
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
And that was

546
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Inefficient

547
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
The least

548
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
But we managed to work our way through

549
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
And survived it

550
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
But I had several product problem

551
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Like that

552
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
That came from

553
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:30,079
A manufacturer trying to improve his margins and you know this is something that in the manufacturing world

554
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
People call Quality fade

555
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
And it's a big problem

556
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
When you manufacture through China

557
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
So you have this

558
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
This product on in the world end

559
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
I would think that

560
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,207
Once you start to become successful they will be knocking

561
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
There will be other companies

562
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
I thought I would go this weekend just

563
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,351
Fresh this guy cuz we can just make a similar thing and

564
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
And make it cheaper or whatever

565
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Yeah that

566
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
That is

567
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
The single biggest problem

568
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
That I have faced

569
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
In mic

570
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Careers.

571
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Nor in frankly it's a

572
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
It's a problem that is

573
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Deviling

574
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Yeah the entire

575
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Consumer

576
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Product space.

577
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
It started with us

578
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
Literally about 6 or 7 years into our

579
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Evolution

580
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
I had somebody call me and say yeah

581
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
I think I just saw it

582
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Perfect your accent

583
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
That's impossible right

584
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
And it turned out that

585
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
In fact

586
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
The rise of the internet

587
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Was changing every

588
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
And it was creating an environment

589
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,848
In which these little manufacturers over in

590
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Uniworld China

591
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Suddenly

592
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Had visibility

593
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Over products that seem to be hot

594
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
So if you have a one-size-fits-all safe

595
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,880
For instance a Gucci bag or or Louis

596
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Baton bag

597
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
That has a high

598
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Sale price

599
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
Perception of a low cost of good

600
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
You end up being a pervert

601
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
Target and we had an explosion

602
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Counterfeiting

603
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
That

604
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Rolled across the market

605
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
And really threatened to two

606
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Causes to fail

607
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,944
Counting up how the legal battle against copycats buried Randy

608
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
It feels and almost sank the company

609

646

Gyros

647
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
So it's around 2010

648
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,736

Cross the country

653
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
The problem is

654
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,952
The exercise straps are also popular with counterfeiters

655
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
And the knockouts

656
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
Eating into the company's bottom line

657
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,864
Randy decides to hire an investigator

658
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Figure out chest

659
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
How many counterfeiters

660
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Are out there

661
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
And they found about 20 different factories scattered around China that were all

662
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Creating

663
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Fake

664
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Counterfeit

665
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
TRX suspension trainer

666
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
And yeah it was it was really it was a

667
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
The shock and it put huge pressure

668
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
On the entire business model

669
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
I guess if you have Distributors they're trying to sell

670
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
The authentic product

671
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Deadpool price

672
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
But then I get these kind of shadowy operators that

673
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Pop up all around them in the internet

674
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Do you know enables

675
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
This in a way that

676
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,008
Generations of entrepreneurs never had to deal with

677
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
And so pretty soon you know it's

678
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
They're everywhere

679
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
Figuring out how to Wrangle that was job number one

680
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
So what did you do attitude

681
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Squash

682
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
He's these guys were eating into your business

683
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
They were devouring

684
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
My business

685
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
You know there's that the stories are Legend of companies that

686
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
Yeah I had great promising Futures that basically

687
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
Went out of business because of counterfeiting

688
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
I think that I was fortunate in that

689
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
It was the early stages where people were starting

690
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
On the enforcement side was starting to

691
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Get a sense that hey this

692
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Counterfeiting businesses

693
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
Is bad and we're going to have to do something

694
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
About it so customs with starting to ramp up its efforts

695
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
And

696
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Fortunately counterfeiting

697
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Felony so

698
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
When you identify them

699
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Everyone wants to take

700
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Take them down

701
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
And so we started this process of

702
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Seizures in China

703
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
With the cooperation

704
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,376
He had some level with Chinese police and then it in the states and in Europe most of the

705
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
The Customs agency

706
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Seize the counterfeit Goods

707
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
So that sort of started to subside

708
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
But what rips

709
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Placed it

710
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
Was that

711
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
The counterfeiters figured out

712
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
If we don't put this Brands trademark

713
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
On our Prada

714
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
And we just copy the app

715
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Design itself but without the trademark

716
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Then it's technically not a counterfeit

717
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
And so it becomes

718
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Much harder to in

719
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
Force against and I was the next big way

720
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Was the knock-offs

721
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
That were copying

722
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Our designs to the TV

723
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
But not

724
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Calling themselves TRX

725
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,984
A bigger problem

726
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Wow what happened

727
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Will Amazon

728
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,920
And the other online marketplaces but particularly Amazon because of its scale

729
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Team this

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992

Well I'm an auction site

732
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,856
For all of these knock-off vendors

733
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Who would

734
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
Misappropriate are trademarks

Develop the market or get you there

747
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
We really experienced

748
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,136
A flattening and actually a negative growth for a couple of years 2014 and 2015

749
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
Wow has the Sea of knock-offs

750

I mean

752
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
You are

753
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
An alpha male

754
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Urocele you're a manly guy

755
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
But I mean let's be honest

756
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
There's no way

757
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
You didn't experience

758
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Anxiety or depression or

759
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Like fear

760
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
All of that

761
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,248
All of that maybe even a few tears guy you know I'm above a bed

762
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,344
Because there was a period of time when I was

763
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Thinking

764
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Well I could make

765
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
These guys go away

766
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
I have a certain skill set

767
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,864
But you know that you have to look away from the light quickly and say no no no this is not where your brain should go

768
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
Yeah I learned some skills as a seal

769
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
About how to manage fear

770
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
And stress and it

771
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Sort of involves a combination of

772
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Compartmentalization

773
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
An action

774
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
And so that's how I kind of

775
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
You don't deal with

776
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
Entrepreneurial

777
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Clearance

778
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Dresses

779
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
You know you put it in a box

780
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Figure out how you can take action on it

781
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
And then you move forward to your next task

782
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Hand

783
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
And hope that

784
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
You know that sticks

785
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Works

786
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
So at that point did you

787
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Like what are you do

788
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Ultimately we

789
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
We decided that we had to take

790
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
The dreaded

791
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
Step of our first litigation action

792
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
And we picked

793
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
One of these knock-offs to go after

794
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Federal patent

795
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Trademark infringement suit

796
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
Because we knew

797
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
If we want it was unlikely that

798
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
We would be able to collect any significant damages cuz these

799
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
These knock off

800
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
Companies don't tend to

801
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
And you'll maintain a bunch of cash on hand

802
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
But we knew that it as a legal precedent

803
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
It could be what we needed to

804
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Clean up the market

805
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
Play sand so we filed a federal

806
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Patent suit

807
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
And trademark suit against one of the largest infringer

808
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,896
So that's a big pain cuz that requires lawyers

809
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
Paying lawyers for the hourly

810
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Billing rates

811
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,064
That's super expensive a man that must have been stressful just to

812
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Do that

813
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
It was really

814
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
And quite scary you know it was just a frame it up know that the rule of thumb is that it takes about

815
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
50000 x 2

816
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
File a patent

817
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Right

818
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
But

819
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
The absolute minimum that

820
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
That one should expect when you

821
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
Try to enforce it

822
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Is half a mil

823
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
That's on me

824
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
That's if you settle

825
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Right before court we ended up

826
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,992
In our action ended up spending about two and a half million bucks

827
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
It took about three years

828
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Wow

829
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,648
It's so interesting because I suspect a lot of counterfeiters or cheaters

830
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,280
They know that an entrepreneur especially one who's not who may be doing well but not

831
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Billionaire

832
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Is going to be disincentivize

833
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
Fight them because the cost

834
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
The legal battle is so expensive I mean

835
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
The lawyers fees are so high and it's

836
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
Take so long that

837
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,872
Probably a lot of people lot of Entrepreneurship

838
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
They just deal with it they just

839
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,200
They just live with all these cheater

840
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
That is exactly what happened

841
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
And

842
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,856
You know a lot of times it ends up being the death knell for the innovator

843
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
Because

844
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
It sucks you night when I talk a lot

845
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
When I talked to entrepreneur groups I talked a lot about that

846
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
One of the most important things an entrepreneur could bring to the table

847
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Is his or her Mojo

848
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
Right and you Wikipedia

849
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
The font of all knowledge to find Mojo is Magic

850
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Powers

851
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
I think it's

852
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,056
It's a little more that it's that

853
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Belief in the mission

854
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
And that appreciation for

855
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Possibilities

856
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
The light just around the next corner

857
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
That is like the stuff of Honor

858
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
The North Ship

859
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,856
And one of the things that happens is

860
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
You know these cheaters come in

861
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
And they create

862
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Competition

863
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Before you can really

864
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Manage

865
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Competition report it

866
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
And then they

867
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
They create legal fee

868
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
These and all of that stuff is like

869
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Cuts in that bag of Mojo

870
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
And it just starts to leak out

871
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,568
Right and a lot of times it just causes entrepreneur ultimately

872
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
To say

873
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,896
Aquatime just worn down

874
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Yelling at walkaway

875
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
What happened with a lawsuit

876
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
MeetMe file the lawsuit and

877
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
3 years and what happened

878
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,768
3 years I made it was relatively recently that we

879
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
That we got the final verdict

880
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
But we we got a unanimous

881
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Verdict

882
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Shadow

883
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
A jury award of

884
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
6.8 million in Damages which

885
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
Which is quite something right implies I don't know something

886
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Mike 22

887
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
20 to 2

888
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
25 million in Lost sales

889
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
And

890
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
What it created was

891
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
The president

892
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
That validated all of our

893
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Are trademarks qunar

894
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Darkie patent

895
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
And

896
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
The jury verdict ended up

897
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Also

898
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Allowing Amazon to take action

899
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
On all of the

900
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
These infringers and so

901
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
You know it's a

902
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Very happy outcome

903
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
Yeah our business almost immediately

904
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
Left up by 40%

905
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
You're the year and see

906
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
To be growing

907
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Rapidly

908
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,920
I mean I know you are so late you're so privately held

909
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
And I've seen reports

910
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Of revenues

911
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Is exceeding 50 million dollars

912
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Maybe hire now

913
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm at my right is it higher now

914
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Will be a little north of that this year

915
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
I'm wondering

916
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
About

917
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Your you're ravenous

918
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
I mean

919
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Do you

920
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Do you is it is it mainly from

921
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
The T-Rex

922
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Products or do you also

923
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
Is a revenue stream from training I mean for example if you train a

924
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
Personal trainer on on TRX and then that

925
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Trainer uses at

926
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
You guys aren't getting any revenue from that

927
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Trainers

928
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
Work for the rest of his or her career right

929
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
What we're not getting

930
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,928
Remy from that individual trainers work but we are monetizing

931
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
The training

932
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,024
So you know what used to be in the in the way back

933
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
We're 100%

934
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Gear

935
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
Right and revenue came from 100% pure sales

936
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
It's

937
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Now it's

938
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
Maybe 70/30

939
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,176
I think pretty quickly will be 60 40 60 being gear still and 40 being

940
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
The soft

941
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Goods

942
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,064
The form of Education revenues and then digital content so we've

943
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Become

944
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
A digital content

945
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
You mean you can download videos or buy videos

946
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Things like that a ride

947
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah through

948
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
Through apps in-app purchases

949
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Etc

950
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Okay here's my

951
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
Big question about Ciara

952
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Which is

953
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
I've used them there

954
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
It's a really really cool it's

955
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
Very simple

956
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Idea and concept and very effective

957
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,176
But I mean this is still a field where Trends come and go right like it was a

958
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Timer

959
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
Pilates is really big and barre3 and

960
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
Yoga everyday things stay and things

961
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Common things going

962
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Jazzercise

963
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
I mean is all aerobics all kind of things

964
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
What's

965
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Yeah what's a guarantee that

966
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
People are going to want to use TRX

967
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
In 5 or 10 years

968
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,888
You know I think that I'm in first wallet for a trend were

969
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Fairly long-lived

970
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Trend at this point

971
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
We've been around now for

972
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
12 13 years

973
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
Ann Arbor

974
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
ARB

975
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
Growing strongly

976
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
But

977
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
I think that one of the things that he

978
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Has been unique

979
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
About

980
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
The company that

981
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
My team

982
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
As built

983
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Is that

984
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
We created

985
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
Both in our hero product

986
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
Suspension

987
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
We became

988
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Switzerland

989
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
And by that I mean

990
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,584
Whatever else it is that you do

991
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
4

992
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Your exercise

993
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
We want to be a part of that

994
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
And we've been very successful

995
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
At

996
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,592
At embedding ourselves I mean just about every one of the

997
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Activities that you mentioned a minute ago

998
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
T-Rex has become part of

999
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Ready

1000
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
I read I read a lot about

1001
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
What's up people who work at the of setup

1002
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Almost all of them

1003
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Have just like

1004
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Activate your charisma

1005
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Your drive

1006
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Find your passion

1007
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Amber Reeves

1008
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
A quote that that somebody said about you it's it's a

1009
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
I think it's a

1010
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,400
Positive quotes critical but it's positive

1011
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Curious

1012
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,496
Hear your reaction to it this is what one of your former

1013
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
I'm in places he said

1014
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,872
Or she said the company's initial success was driven by Randy's Charisma and

1015
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Ego

1016
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
In a good way people would live and die for him

1017
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
But the same Charisma ego that allow the come

1018
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
Need to grow from his garage

1019
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
Play highrise in downtown Sac

1020
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Francisco

1021
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
Is what has gotten him into trouble it be

1022
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
Became hubristic

1023
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
It's literally killing

1024
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
The company that came out

1025
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
A few years ago

1026
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
You seen that cartoon shirt

1027
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,144
What did you think when you saw that did it did it hurt your feelings did you think it was

1028
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
Truth to it for

1029
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Is completely off base

1030
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
Well you know I think that

1031
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
That I mean obviously I'm not I'm not

1032
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
I agree with

1033
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,176
The quote word for word

1034
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
I think that there's

1035
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
There's probably some truth in it

1036
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
In that

1037
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Look when you

1038
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
When you're an entrepreneur in your

1039
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
You're trying to build something

1040
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
From scratch

1041
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
You got to have a

1042
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Baton of

1043
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Efface

1044
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
In your eyes

1045
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
Dia and you have to be Headstrong

1046
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
Because if you're not

1047
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
You won't survive

1048
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
And as you start to scale

1049
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
There's a lot of things that happen to a business

1050
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
And one of the things that I realized is that

1051
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
Communication

1052
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
Becomes really the

1053
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Hardest

1054
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Challenge 2

1055
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
To conquer

1056
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
You know your team

1057
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Grows large

1058
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
Yeah people scattered around various geogra

1059
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Duffy's

1060
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
And I think that

1061
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
You know there are different

1062
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,000
Levels of understanding within the team sometimes about what's affecting

1063
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Business

1064
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,840
And so yeah there were there was a period of time where I think we

1065
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
You know we got a little big for our britches and

1066
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
And as the leader

1067
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
Of the organization I'm certainly owned that

1068
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
But

1069
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
There is I wouldn't call it ego I weigh

1070
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
I would call it more

1071
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
I guess

1072
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Strength of will write you you have a

1073
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Level of conviction

1074
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
That

1075
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,600
There's some significant amount of Hope Bond

1076
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
And that's how you you sort of key

1077
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,208
You know the team focused on

1078
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
The realm of the possible and the opportunity that's just around the

1079
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
The next corner

1080
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
What do you think about

1081
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Where this

1082
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Companies headed and where

1083
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
And your role at I mean

1084
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
What do you think is this

1085
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,848
Going to be your life's work is this what you want to do

1086
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
For the rest of your life

1087
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
Cuz you're not mean you're an old guy then you can

1088
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,760
You can do something else if you want to you can create something

1089
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
Entirely new

1090
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,880
I suppose old is a relative but it's in the eye of the beholder right

1091
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
I mean it's funny to be in 51

1092
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
I remember as a young seal pup

1093
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Looking at the Admirals and think at those guys

1094
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Older than dirt

1095
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
And you know one of my best friends is Admiral Tim Szymanski who now has it

1096
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,264
Heads the organization down there and he doesn't seem old to me at all now

1097
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
But

1098
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
You know what

1099
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
I

1100
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
I really love starting things I love that entrepreneurial

1101
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Energy

1102
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,296
I'm putting a team together and tackling big problems and

1103
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
And seeing the progress and surmount

1104
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
Can the challenges I I love that

1105
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
And we still have plenty of that going on at

1106
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
A TRX

1107
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
We aim to become the world's first great

1108
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
Multi-domain training bra

1109
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
And nobody's ever done it

1110
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
And so I think

1111
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
You know I I don't

1112
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
I don't have any plans to go anywhere other than keep

1113
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Keep keep going

1114
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Keep doing what we're doing

1115
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,896
Are you at a place now where you can kind of take a breath and say okay

1116
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
Forget where we

1117
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
We made it and then we're going to be just fine

1118
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
But not yet but I think I can see it from where I stay

1119
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
Randy hetrick founder of

1120
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
TRX

1121
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,840
If you always wanted to have a gym in your hotel room complete with TRX straps

1122
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,400
Well your wishes may have been answered

1123
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:07,008
Last year Hilton Hotels rolled out new hotel rooms that double as

1124
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Gyms

1125
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Equipped with free weights

1126
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Yoga mats

1127
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Stationary bikes

1128

1142

And today

1143
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
Updated story we ran last year but the story actually begins about 6 years ago

1144
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
Matt Wallace was just standing in his kitchen in Washington DC we had a bag of cherries and

1145
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,544
In the fridge and we needed to use them before they went bad as girlfriend Corey

1146
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Turkey burgers at the time and they were short on ketchup I like to mess around in the kitchen so that's where

1147
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
My creative

1148
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:26,112
Banerjee kind of comes out knowing you you probably wanted to make tomato ketchup but we didn't have tomato so you said I'm

1149
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm going to make cherry ketchup recipe

1150
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
Vinegar and sugar ants

1151
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,840
Spices and boom he had fresh cherry ketchup

1152
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
That was kind of sweet

1153
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,752
Smokey it was definitely a novel thing and we we both really liked it

1154
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
In the story could have ended their except

1155
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
A few months later

1156
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408
That was sitting in his office he works in the energy business

1157
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
And he started to sing

1158
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
But you wasn't thinking about energy

1159
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
You know I kept thinking about the ketchup

1160
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
I just had this moment of realizing

1161
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah there's literally one kind of ketchup on the market and there's this huge gap that no one knows about

1162
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,352
Tyranny of the Tomato at any Gap in the market that could be

1163
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Build

1164
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Not just with cherries but

1165
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Withal

1166
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Kinds of fruit

1167
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
So that day

1168
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
He emailed Corey about starting a business

1169
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
It was probably 30 emails back and forth and I felt like I had the idea kind of downloaded into my head

1170
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Fully form

1171
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,064
What he also knew right away that he wanted to call it chops

1172
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,904
Because his best friend growing up referred to catch up as Chucky

1173
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Flight path the chop

1174
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
So Corey and Matt started to experiment

1175
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
They took celery and onion garlic

1176
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Vinegar

1177
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
And it makes those ingredients with

1178
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Blueberries

1179
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Mangoes peaches

1180
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Plums and of course

1181
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Cherries

1182
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
And what they came up with were five different types of ketchup

1183
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,895
They work really well with a lot of foods that you wouldn't normally pair your

1184
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Pines with

1185
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Pork tenderloin

1186
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
Fried rice

1187
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,367
Great as a base for vinaigrette

1188
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,719
And the thumbs-up from celebrity Chef Jose Andres who actually

1189
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,815
Feature the ketchups in one of those restaurants that was really the impetus

1190
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
For me that

1191
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
This guy knows what he's talking about

1192
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
If we have his sort of

1193
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
Unofficial endorsement that this is a good product

1194
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,591
Yeah we got to go for it we going to make this thing official some Matt Corey raise $22,000

1195
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Kickstarter

1196
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,479
Remove traps out of their kitchen and into a shared commercial space in DC

1197
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,087
Somewhere along the line they also got married and they started selling chips

1198
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,183
Website and it a few independent markets in the DC area

1199
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,023
We wanted to do something meaningful we wanted to do something together

1200
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
Yeah burger

1201
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,191
Learning the art of the hustle and all of those things and we get better at it every week

1202
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,007
It's not killing it flying off the grocery store shelves

1203
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Weave

1204
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Put everything into it

1205
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,127
Anyway it's all Sweat Equity at this point

1206
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Since we last spoke to Matt and Kori Wallace

1207
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
They changed their business strategy a bit there now focusing Less on retail and more on selling home

1208
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Wholesale to restaurant

1209
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,255
They're also looking for a distributor while keeping their day jobs and doing chips kind of on the side

1210
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,327
And there are other major side Hustle

1211
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
They just had a baby

1212
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
His name is Harrison

1213
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
