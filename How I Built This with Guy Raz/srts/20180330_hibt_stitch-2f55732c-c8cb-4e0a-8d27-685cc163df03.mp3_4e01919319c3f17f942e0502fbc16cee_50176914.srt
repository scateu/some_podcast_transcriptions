Best and the following message come from Michigan Economic Development

00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
Corporation

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
Seewhy michigan

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,448
Is attracting top talent and top business

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,008
By searching Michigan pure opportunity

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:18,432
At that seed stage like it was a hundred percent just an idea

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
I would come in and I'd say like you. Here's the beta that I did like 20 people and here's how I think the business model of shape up

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
And then probably talk to 30 angel investors who said No and when your

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
I'm doing something that nobody else is doing you are either the smartest or the stupidest

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
Ron NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist in the story

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
Face behind the movements they built

13
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
How Katrina Lake defy the investment world to build a tech company that transfer

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Warm clothes shopping online

15
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Every year seems there's always a

16
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,872
1password or idea that everyone in Silicon Valley

17
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
He seems to be talking about

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
Couple years ago

19
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,992
Cryptocurrency recently it's been

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Blockchain

21
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,344
But is also a widely-held idea in the tech world that

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
The days of Rage

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Retail stores

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Our number

25
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Of course this

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,536
Is a combination of wishful thinking and hyperbole

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
There is something to it

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Especially with

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Big retailers

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,472
Macy's is struggling Bon-Ton and Toys R Us

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
File for bankruptcy

32
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
And in October of 2017

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Lord & Taylor sold it

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
Flagship building in Manhattan

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,832
That amazing Italian Renaissance Building on 5th Avenue is now worth more as a wework

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Then as a department store

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
And the main reason why of course is that

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
People just aren't going into big department stores

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
They're buying a lot more stuff online

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,424
Note convenience is a major reason of course but so is

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Time

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
Time is increasingly Limited

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
That's really work Katrina Lakes idea begins

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Because she got older and

45
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Busier with work

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
She found that she had to last

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Time to go shopping for clothes

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,320
And only rich people could afford personal shopper associate

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,416
Why don't figure out a way to make that more affordable

50
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Unless time

51
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
And that was the Genesis of Stitch fix

52
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
An online personal shopping service

53
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Not today Stitch fix has

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,960
2 million customers with Pinnacle Revenue close to a billion dollars

55
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
And in 2017

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Katrina became the

57
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,872
Youngest female CEO ever to take a company public

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
It wasn't necessarily going to be a

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Slam dunk business

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
In fact

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
Katrina had a hard time raising money

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
In the beginning

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Jesse grew up in San Francisco in

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
In a bicultural home

65
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
Mom is Japanese dad

66
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
What is American

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
And at the age of 15

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Her parents decided to move the family from

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
The Bay Area

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
To Minnesota

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Which if you've seen inside out

72
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Is the exact

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Opposite of what happened

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Flight movie

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Like to go from in San Francisco at

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688
More diversity and like the high school that I went to was

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
70

78
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Percent Asian and then to go

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
2A School in Minneapolis where

80
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
I think there were

81
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,696
Three Asian people at three and a half if you include me in my class and

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
We were a very bilingual bicultural household

83
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
And so we my mom

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
My mom spoke only Japanese to me still does

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
And my dad obviously

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Facebook Oh My English

87
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
And we celebrate a lot of Japanese holidays and

88
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
Point would bring lunch to school

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,200
I think it was we had comes like a schedule and three days a week it would be onigiri which is rice balls that have something in the middle

90
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
And then two days a week with sandwiches

91
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Katrina went to Stanford for college and initially thought

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
She's going to be a doctor

93
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Like your dad but she ended up majoring in

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Economics

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
And after she graduated

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Working at a

97
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Consulting

98
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Advising other businesses

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703
22 years old and still not really sure what

100
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
She wanted to do

101
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,823
You know honestly at that point I wasn't thinking that I wanted to do something on

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Entrepreneurial

103
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,175
But like I had all these ideas on what these businesses

104
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
You could do better

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
This should be personalized

106
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,367
Don't like this is just a transaction it should be an experience and likewise in your head or ideas that you actually told

107
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Both

108
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Like there's an example we working with

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
A large rate

110
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
And they actually said like that they wanted ideas

111
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
What's the

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
Future going to be like in this event

113
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Mm

114
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Sex and was literally before the iPhone

115
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
And like I had this idea where I was

116
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Like why are you in a store

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Why do you have to have every single size

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,407
Whiskey on the floor it seems silly that is it a person has to walk in and like

119
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Find the sizes

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Rescue and then

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Take it themselves to a fitting room and lie

122
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
Are they, this idea where you like half of the store is

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
A warehouse industry

124
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
And the other half

125
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Is like a museum

126
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
You walk around and see all these beautiful merchandise things and

127
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,887
You log in when you come in and you get a wand and then you can just put the wand in front of the outfits that you think

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Like and then

129
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
You walk into the back

130
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Hi guy like yours your fitting room

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Real bad

132
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,919
All the things that you wanted or whatever would be stacked up there and then there'll be recommendations and

133
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
You know you could have one size up in one size down and

134
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
You know it could just be like

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,087
Much better experience and like going in

136
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Weeding through rocks

137
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
I like people looked at me like I had seven

138
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
And you feel like eating in retrospect I'm like

139
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,583
That was crazy like if I was a CEO that retailer I feel like

140
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
Interesting idea totally impractical

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
23 year old

142
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
Teletubby birthday ideas

143
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,151
And so you know I mean I didn't share all the idea then I wouldn't say that all of the ideas that I shared were well-received but like

144
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
I had tons of ideas about how things to be done.

145
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Do you work for this consulting firm I guess

146
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
4

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Like 2 years and then you

148
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
Decide to go work for a venture capital

149
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Company

150
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Why

151
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
You know I look back on that and I really laughed because I was

152
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Like really unhappy with the amount of work

153
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
And so I took this job at a VC fine which like I did

154
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Actually want to be an adventurer

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
Capitalist and night you know I didn't

156
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
It wasn't that industry that was appealing to me but

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
I would like if I'm going to work at

158
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
A place that's going to be the crazy retail idea of the future like

159
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
This is the way I can meet

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Oh wow so you actually thought

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,135
I'm working here I'm going to hear all these pitches and maybe I'll find a cool company and join it

162
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
Yeah and so and I did and I'm at hundreds of entrepreneurs in

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
Am I eating right for you a

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
Like a money person where you managing money or

165
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Were you on the analysis I'd were you

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,031
In a room where these people come and pitch and you would throw like Shark Tank questions

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
I was in that

168
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
But I was more like the note taker

169
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
I'm like I took the notes and I would create investment memos that were like

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
A summary of the opportunity

171
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Play I could have my opinion almost

172
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
For sure but I wasn't an investor

173
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Yeah and

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
It was also it was a weird

175
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
To be adventurous

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Because I was there from

177
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Host

178
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
7 tone

179
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
You know we had the right of it

180
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Versace

181
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
It was a weird time to be in bed

182
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
And

183
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
I didn't ultimately find

184
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
The company

185
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Heard tons of ideas

186
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
Totally I probably not over a hundred on

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
The printer is in the

188
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
And I was there

189
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
And the most important learning

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Actually was that

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
All of these people were just like

192
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Super unqualified normal people with lots of ideas just like I was a superhero

193
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Words with like

194
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
They were just really good at I guess

195
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
What kind of like

196
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
You know making the case for

197
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
And so I think it was actually the more powerful thing was that I realize that if I have all these ideas about what

198
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,127
Should be happening like I don't need to be in the peanut gallery Lobby my idea that people like I should just do it

199
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Myself

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
And I could do it myself

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
But

202
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
It still wasn't

203
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
My like First Choice like my first choice would have still been

204
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
Like if I had met an entrepreneur who is amazing compelling and

205
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
Creating the retail of a feature like it was probably still my first choice to join somebody that just started myself but now all the sudden

206
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,679
And I had this other plan which is like well I guess if I don't find that maybe there's a way that I could do it

207
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
So when you

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,311
Conclusion that maybe you can do this yourself

209
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
What did you do

210
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,759
I don't know that it was like a moment I think it just entered my mind is like this is another possibility and

211
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
I actually ultimately applied to business school which

212
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
To do that

213
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Instead of just sleeping into starting business

214
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,047
Yeah and that wasn't even a choice like it wasn't like I can start a business or go to Business School

215
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
I I was not like my risk profile I was never going to like quit my job and

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Milly got was just

217
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
That was never a choice in my mind

218
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
And so I was like I can

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
Take these two years I can be a mediocre student

220
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,271
And you know my end goal by the end of the two years is I if I can have a company-funded if I can be paying myself a salary

221
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
If I can be paying back my student loans the day I graduate

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Then

223
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
The risk profile about your partnership with tenable

224
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,023
Me and then my plan B would be well if I can't do that I'll have this NBA

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Harvard and I'll be able to join a great company in the great founder and do

226
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Something interesting

227
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
She gets a Harvard as a goodness

228
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Student in 2009

229
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
And

230
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Did you like it

231
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
I did

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
It was intense place right

233
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
It was very different from

234
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Maybe all of the experiences I had

235
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
I mean we've heard these stories from especially from professors there

236
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Do women

237
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
Who talked about in the classroom the discussion

238
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
Pretend to be in the hands go up our man of the voices that

239
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
You here mostly are men

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Did you

241
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
Find that and was it a place where you felt comfortable raising your hand in

242
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Talking

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
I did I mean I did and I think

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
That stereotype is probably

245
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
Probably was true

246
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
But I did feel comfortable talking I think

247
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
And I had a hard time disentangling Eno is it gender is it

248
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Being from California and saying like

249
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Like what were the things that

250
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,695
Created this to be true but like I did feel a little bit underestimated and

251
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
I really tried

252
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Actively strip like out of my vocabulary

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
Your people say that even like a Southern accent makes

254
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
People think a certain thing and I felt

255
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Sounding like I was from California also did the

256
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
The same thing and so

257
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Yeah I didn't feel like

258
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
I was

259
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
The

260
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Most likely to succeed in the classroom

261
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Have the idea for

262
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
What would become Switchback switch

263
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,671
What's a early idea that came to had it even began were you given an assignment where you

264
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
Told to analyze a problem like

265
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Wow what was the beginning of it

266
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
So I had a bunch of

267
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
I kind of collected a bunch of CiCi's and ideas in my head

268
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
If you look at

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,775
Industries in probably had like a little bit of an academic approach and how it looked

270
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
Did these things but like the hunting and fishing and

271
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
It's I know

272
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
It's a huge industry

273
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Massive PP

274
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,783
You are super passionate about it it's really fragmented but also

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Concentrated words like really Mom and Pops are all serious like

276
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Orvis end

277
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,231
Anyway it's a super interesting industry because it's massive and there's elements of fashion

278
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
Actually worth like it whether it's technology or actual fashion things go out of style

279
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
And so I rented a car and I drove to

280
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
New Hampshire

281
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Unlike visited like

282
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Two Gun Shop

283
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
And like the fact by that's the second one I was like

284
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
Disrupt the whole gun industry

285
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
I just was like I don't care how big of an industry this is like I'm just not super fashion about it and also like

286
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
I am not

287
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
The person to like

288
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
Disrupt the hunting and fishing

289
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
I think there probably is

290
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,583
It is all the same like I was actively exploring a couple of ideas

291
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
I like this

292
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
Is a real thing and it has a reason to belong in the world

293
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
And the idea of

294
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
Stitch fix was one. I also texted and

295
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Explored in the way I did that was your idea

296
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
The idea was how can you

297
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
I mean they're couple different Beast

298
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
He's the one pieces overall was just like

299
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
More and more dollars are moving to

300
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
E-commerce stores like this is the map that I found was super compelling for my time and Consulting was dollars are leaving stores in

301
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Funny Commerce

302
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
As dollars gradually leave every one of those dollars is

303
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Usually

304
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
Hurtful to a store as it loses

305
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Because all the sudden you can't pay your rent

306
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,799
People in soap be like a 10% 15% decline in your store volume can kill a store

307
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
And 10 or 15%.

308
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Nothing like all that much

309
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Watching soap

310
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
There's this kind of like

311
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Death spiral that I

312
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Kind of anticipated would happen with

313
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
And Netflix is blocked

314
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
You're kind of like the best example of it. Like

315
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Even if

316
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
30% of the people in your town are using Netflix

317
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
70% of 2

318
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
The people in your town are going to block

319
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Republican

320
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
I mean the writing on the wall

321
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
Then the death spiral component of it is like that one blockbuster

322
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Store closes

323
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
And now

324
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
The 70% of the p

325
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
People who lived in that town

326
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,775
Have to decide do I drive 10 MI

327
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
Another Blockbuster I do I try this Netflix thing

328
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
At 30% the minority of people in my town or are doing

329
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
That was a probably a big

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,783
Conversation at that time because Netflix was killing blockbusters

331
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Yes it's fascinating so I

332
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Expected that would happen in retail apparel

333
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,767
And then on top of that I felt like there was this massive depersonalization of

334
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
I'm retail that was

335
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,143
Happening which one you're buying toilet paper iPhone chargers or diapers is

336
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
You don't need that to

337
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
But that totally ignore this

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Category of apparel which is like deeply personal and

339
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
I'm deeply nuanced and r

340
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,247
Product categories that are super emotional like you're not kind of emotionally buying a box

341
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
Kleenex felt like you were very emotionally buying that plays early and so I felt like all of the emotion and

342
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
You want to Ben

343
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Stripped out and you Commerce and that that wasn't

344
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
The right

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Approach

346
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
The idea was

347
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,935
How can you deliver a really actually personal experience

348
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
And apparel

349
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
And use data in

350
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Technology to make that

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Scalable in makeup better

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
But why I mean why wouldn't you just you know

353
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,015
Offer up a bunch of options and just let people can a scroll through

354
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
Legacy I love the beauty of online shopping is really that time was infinite choices right you could just

355
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Scroll through it and find a thing you like

356
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Yeah and I think four

357
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
Some customers you know that the way that they want

358
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Rashad Butler

359
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Like I'm five

360
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
And so there's

361
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
A whole world of

362
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Apparel that's like

363
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Literally not Rowlett

364
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Just simply because they're not going to fail because I'm the wrong height

365
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,175
And the things that you know if you're living in California you can go on a homepage and they're trying to sell you

366
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,015
Cashmere mittens and it's like that's totally irrelevant

367
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
So if you feel back like what Stitch fix does it's like

368
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,463
Yes like if you could instead of going to a mall all day or instead of spending

369
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
You know your entire evening with 30 browser tabs

370
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Open to try to compare and contrast

371
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Different genes you want to buy

372
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
If you could get a box sent to you

373
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
That had

374
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,311
Two pairs of jeans are even better one pair of jeans and they fit you great that is an infinitely better experience than

375
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
The other

376
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
This idea about

377
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
Business

378
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Send a subscription box

379
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
2 closed

380
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
People but how did you

381
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Because you can begin to think of

382
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
About house

383
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
So is the way it works is basically I would have

384
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,303
Friends of friends fill out a survey and you would let me know what size and style what thing

385
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,423
Things you like Brands you like all the form to company and named

386
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
This isn't 2010 I was experimenting

387
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
As a student essentially

388
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Writing to other friends and students in

389
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,687
The benefit of being in Boston to is like I didn't really happen

390
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
How many friends in Boston and that was easier to meet strangers

391
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
And so one of the things that I needed to prove to myself was like it wasn't going to be scalable for you to tell

392
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,511
Tell me okay on these are the 7 Things I want and then for me to go buy this

393
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
But the math doesn't work for that too

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Scalable

395
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,655
And so you need to have a set of inventory or working from and so

396
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
I was buying

397
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
Inventory at retail

398
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Front booty

399
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
And

400
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
I would keep track of like

401
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
I did have a 14-day return policy or a 30 day return policy and then I would use I wasn't making any money doing this but I would use that as

402
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Is my inventory

403
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,599
So that when somebody was thought their profile I would then put together a box of things

404
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
That were relevant based on what they

405
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Sheridan their Pro

406
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,767
File and then they would try things on and then if they wanted to buy things they would write me up for

407
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Personal check and I would

408
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
Sell it to them and if they didn't want to keep it and

409
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
If I ultimately didn't sell it within my 14 days

410
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Return window I go north

411
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
How did you buy

412
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Stop add a credit card at the

413
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
$6,000 limit

414
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
No dice

415
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
And you would buy them and then sell them in the market

416
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,319
No I was just telling them at the price that I was right so I wasn't making any money I just wanted to like how to see if it would work

417
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
And how many

418
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Friends were in

419
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Peanut

420
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Funny baby

421
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
What did you find from

422
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
This group of 20 people what did you discover

423
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
I discovered that

424
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,775
Do you actually could learn a lot from somebody and there's just this thesis around like do I have to like be with you in person

425
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Understand your style and who you are or can I do that

426
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
And like I felt pretty confident

427
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Like you to do it

428
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
There was a number of items

429
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
I started out with 10 items

430
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,343
And the reality was like people working to try on 10 items it's a lot it's

431
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
A lot of work

432
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,719
And you just look at something in your like now there's no way I'm going to like that and you just don't

433
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Denso ten

434
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Was too many

435
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Did I learn

436
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,911
I think I learned the brand thing of Vicodin

437
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
You know people were actually

438
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
Surprisingly very open to buying from brands that

439
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
They weren't aware of and in fact found some value in finding brands that they wouldn't have normally have found on their own

440
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
When did you pull a trigger and say

441
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
Alright let's let's leave form a business that's supposed to get an LLC on let's like

442
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Make this real

443
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
It was

444
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,511
We didn't actually the company wasn't formed until February

445
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Mm

446
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
11

447
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
But

448
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,959
I kind of became all in on this and not other Concepts I would say like

449
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Late 2010

450
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
So when you

451
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
When you really can't lie

452
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Got this going in at that time it was not just

453
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
Be right wasn't you were not the only one about

454
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Yatika founder of the

455
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
She's the wife of my

456
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
And so how are you

457
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Grain is business an

458
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Also being a student

459
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
I scheduled my classes so that they were a lot they were all lumped together in the middle either in the middle of it and of the week

460
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,375
I did something with my scheduling that enabled me to be able to spend almost a week in California

461
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,983
And so in January and then again in February I spent almost a full week

462
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Out here

463
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,847
And what I would do out here was meet with Angel Investors and

464
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
On Valentine's Day

465
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
A 2011 we got a term sheet

466
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Steve Anderson

467
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,855
Steve Anderson is an investor that you met through other people and he gave you money to give you

468
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
He gave it to him sheet

469
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,999
4/2 million dollars inside now go talk to other Angel Investors

470
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
And try to find others

471
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Dwayne The Rock

472
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
And then probably talk to

473
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
30 other people who

474
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Said no ultimately even though he had already

475
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Said yeah yeah

476
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
In that

477
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
NSR winter in Spring of 2011 when you

478
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
You took the research you gathered from these 20

479
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
People

480
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
And you went

481
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
To meet with investors in the Silicon Valley

482
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,135
Did you just you show them this day then you should see I try this on 20 friends in this is what we found right I mean

483
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
You can understand

484
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
You can understand I guess

485
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Why they might have been

486
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,071
I know I would come in and I'd say like you. Here's the beta that I did

487
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Like 20 people in here's how I think the

488
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Model shape up and like I would bring a box in

489
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
And I feel like yours in exam

490
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Will the box look like

491
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
Laminated cards

492
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Any of the Box wasn't like

493
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
All that nice

494
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Spent any money on Brandy

495
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
I'm at that seed stage like it was a

496
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
100% Jessie

497
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
Explain wow you explained

498
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
What the business model was

499
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Because I just to clarify Stitch fix today

500
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
You sign up

501
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
You paid 20 bucks a month

502
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
You get five items

503
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Do you every month

504
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
Option end if you

505
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
By the mall you get a discount

506
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
And

507
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
If you return them all that's

508
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
It's fine it's free but it's

509
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
$20 a month

510
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Essentially for 8

511
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Personal Style

512
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,175
Yeah and it's $20 and to be very clear like you don't have to do it on a monthly basis you could do a quarterly you can do it all a cart like

513
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,807
Like you don't you know you don't need to commit to any time for him but it is every time you get a fix you paid $20 styling fee

514
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
$20 is credit towards anything

515
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Is Dubai

516
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
But the heart of it was really this like

517
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,768
We're going to buy inventory we're going to get to know you were going to become experts on

518
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
You client America mask

519
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
On products

520
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
And then we're going to generate really

521
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
Great reputation

522
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Action of those two

523
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,128
Set a big investment right act like what we did and what we did that and what we do now is like

524
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
We are like a department store

525
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
You keeping her have the exact

526
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
When's the when I would go and raise

527
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Half million dollars

528
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Steve Anderson

529
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,648
Half of that was literally going to buy dresses and clothes

530
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Adventure investors

531
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
I hated that

532
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
But I'm Not only would they hated that but

533
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
You

534
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
If in your business model you said

535
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Where can I personalize

536
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Human being

537
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Involved in picking

538
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Stop I mean Venture people

539
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
They don't like to pay

540
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
People like they like companies that that are like they like user-generated content or they like to pay for

541
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Human resource

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
People said like this is going to be an inventor

543
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Gory nightmare like

544
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
And it was good feedback because

545
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Ultimately

546
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Inventory

547
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,208
We are very good at managing inventory and we

548
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
And you have people saw that and people

549
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Wordscapes

550
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
You'd be able to

551
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
Over that period of time when you're trying to raise money

552
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
And all everybody

553
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Except for Steve said no

554
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
I'm was that

555
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Demoralizing

556
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Disheartening or whatever

557
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
I know Waterford

558
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Dinos

559
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Both

560
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
I'm like you just you had to be able to have reason

561
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
4 confidence in

562
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
What you were doing regarding

563
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Adventure

564
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
And so you did have to have the

565
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
6 get about it and you did have to

566
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Let It Be

567
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Stop

568
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
But at the same time

569
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
What we were doing like

570
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Nobody else is really doing

571
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
I feel like a very long time

572
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
And

573
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,752
When you're doing something that nobody else is doing

574
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
You are either the

575
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Smartest

576
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,456
Or the stupidest person in the room

577
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
When we come back why despite early growth the money man in Silicon Valley

578
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,464
Want to give Stitch fix the valuation Katrina thought it deserved

579
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
And how she fought back

580
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

606
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Gyros

607
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
It's the spring of 2011

608
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
And with the seed money she got from

609
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
1

610
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Single investor

611
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
Katrina Lake got a small office in San Francisco

612
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
And got to work

613
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,776
Yeah is that where they got the term sheet

614
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:50,432
In April it funded in May I graduated and then in June moved to San Francisco

615
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,040
In San Francisco was important to do it because this is where you want to live or because of the

616
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
The tech industry or

617
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
Honestly

618
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
Another smart way to talk about it as the tech industry but honestly like when I first started the company okay we have to be in New York

619
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
And then like a couple months and I realized

620
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
New York lots of companies are here like

621
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
I think it would have been

622
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,568
Really hard to do what we did anywhere else because we have

623
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,152
Many many data scientists and many many engineers and

624
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
In retrospect

625
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
It was not just about me being comfortable about it if we wanted to fulfill on the vision if using technology to

626
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
They deliver our service like it would have been varied

627
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
Were you able to build a website with that money

628
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
No we're not yet yeah so the first

629
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
7 months of Stitch fix like we didn't have a website actually it was their first name was Rock habit which lasted for about three months before

630
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
We got

631
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,312
It was very clear that Nordstrom would have sued us for it if she knows.

632
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
Five seconds of looking at was like this you got to change your name

633
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
Kissing you used to call it Stitch fix

634
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Yeah

635
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,904
Asleep on website yet and what is it for

636
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Cheese look like

637
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
How do you go to stitchfix.com

638
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
And it said

639
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
Coming soon do you want any part of a dice

640
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,120
And then it said if you if you clicked on yes I want a part of the beta it would

641
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Cluck-U / 2

642
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,216
I forget if it was a Google doc or a SurveyMonkey but if something

643
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
And then you fill out all your information and you say your interests

644
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
And we actually had a weightless

645
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Just for a long time because

646
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,712
We didn't have clothes to send to you that we're relevant and demand

647
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Paste kind of what

648
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
We had for a long time

649
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,136
And so once I was ready for you I would send you a link that said like

650
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Stitch fix is ready for you

651
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
And then I would

652
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
I would send you a pic

653
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
PayPal request

654
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
For $20

655
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
And

656
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
I'm so the history of The Styling fee that we have was that I was worried that

657
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,080
You could be a boss or somebody who's going to steal money for steal my clothes and so I felt like if you were willing to

658
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
To PayPal me $20

659
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Before I'd even sent you anything

660
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,480
You are probably a legitimate human being who wasn't going to steal

661
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
My clothes you could take the rest

662
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Right and so

663
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,624
I would PayPal request you for $20 you give me $20

664
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
And then I would

665
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Sanju

666
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
A shipment of five items

667
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
And inside there was like a paper return survey cuz we still didn't have a website and so it was a piece of paper that was like in

668
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:23,008
An Excel thing that had all the items and then you would fill out with words what you were going to keep what you aren't going to keep in explaining why

669
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
And then we would have taskrabbit to type that

670
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,224
Into Excel so that we had to go back in that information so that

671
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
We had it

672
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
And then

673
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:39,648
Based on what you were keeping and not keeping a net of your $20 styling fee I would send you a Paypal invoice for the neck

674
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,256
And that was kind of hot worked in the ending where were you getting the closer

675
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,632
And we're buying at wholesale and so we were buying six items at a time

676
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
We would go to it like

677
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,288
There's any shows you can go to and you can go introduce yourself to Brands and

678
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
You know most of the brands weren't that interested in working with us but you know someone give us a shot and say like I don't know that's an interesting

679
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
You can buy

680
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:09,088
6 items from us and literally would buy Six of one thing at a time

681
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Will not

682
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah definitely

683
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
And who was

684
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Scott who is peking cook how did you

685
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,352
I mean you obviously you know how to dress well you are well-dressed right here but I mean

686
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,704
That's a big responsibility till I beat a personal stylist

687
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah even a hundred people even 30 people

688
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
Yeah and I mean it was

689
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Aren't we hired our first stylist

690
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Like February

691
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
2012

692
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
At first light

693
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Gear just

694
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
It's like it was probably me

695
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Yeah under the time it was a weird one packing the Box you are in San Francisco

696
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
And it's

697
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,096
You know you're potentially doing everything and you've got this

698
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Website

699
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
And

700
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
Are you getting the word out

701
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
It was literally just

702
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
People telling other people

703
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
And dope

704
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,080
It was 29 minutes 35 and was 110 then

705
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
235 and then

706
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
It just like

707
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
Over that summer of 2011

708
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Yeah

709
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,064
Yeah those are the actual cohort numbers for each month and then I think after that it started

710
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
Getting the attention of on

711
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
What I would call like

712
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Small to medium sized

713
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Weather in Bogota

714
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,816
Write it certainly wasn't in Vogue and it wasn't like the bloggers at public millions of

715
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Followers but it was

716
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
People who have like 50

717
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
2000 followers

718
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
1000followers about it

719
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Yeah I would I mean if that I would

720
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,056
And that was a really big driver

721
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
For us for a long time

722
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
So now you're

723
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,432
Starting to get some momentum and obviously you're

724
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
Growing you need more money you need millions of dollars

725
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
When you would show up

726
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Seeking money

727
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Was it challenging I mean

728
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,232
But let's be honest I mean Blues bass majority of

729
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
Of people intact

730
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
Are men and in

731
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,680
The space you know going to be seized are probably used to sing mostly men

732
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
Was the gender Dynamic ever something that was

733
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Present that you

734
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Felt that you

735
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Southworth

736
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Against you that made it harder to

737
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
Raise money or generate interest

738
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Raising money was really hard

739
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
And

740
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
I think there are a lot of factors that

741
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,904
I mean certainly the inventory side like that's real like

742
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,696
Silicon Valley venture investors

743
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,768
I'm want to buy software engineer that they want to buy a

744
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Like they don't want to bike

745
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
The gender Dynamic was real

746
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Also

747
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,984
You know 94% of venture investors are man and

748
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Probably the majority of men don't feel passion

749
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
About dressing lemon

750
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,408
I'm curious what you know with respect to your experience with venture capitalist

751
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,248
Because the Dermatology about them and the genius of Entry

752
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
The capitalists in

753
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
You know how they

754
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Great rest

755
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,416
Seeing if they can invest in hundreds or thousands of

756
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
Failures and they just need one or two

757
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Till like

758
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
Come out and look like geniuses

759
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,376
Mythology of the oracle

760
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
You know like this

761
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
Oracle venture capitalist

762
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
You know

763
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
Gifted and can just pick winners but

764
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
I don't think that really matches with real

765
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Yeah

766
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
And it is like it creates another dynamic

767
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
To where

768
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
And I don't think I realize this is

769
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,576
The time but you're right like they want billion dollar

770
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,184
Businesses and they would either rather they want you to be a zero or a billion

771
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
Everything in the middle is not that

772
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
And so

773
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
People were like this is a real business and it's really working

774
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,168
But you know I don't know if it can be more than a 30 million-dollar

775
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
Revenue or more than like a hundred million dollars in Revenue

776
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,032
Do you like I just don't think it's that big

777
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
And likes to a normal person

778
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
3 million dollars are a hundred million dollars in science

779
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,712
But like from a venture capitalist perspective like

780
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
They make the most money when

781
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
It's a billion or 0

782
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
And so

783
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,136
Are there a lot of people were like hey what you're doing is traction and it's real and it's working

784
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
But like I don't think it can be big enough for

785
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Yeah

786
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Depending you still raised

787
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Baron money

788
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
42 million dollars

789
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
You know In the Beginning Witch

790
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Which sounds

791
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
Pretty good but I guess you still needed to.

792
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Vicky Pattison

793
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Yeah I mean

794
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Once I had a little bit of

795
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,384
Traction in some weird ways it made it

796
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
Harder because now all the sudden

797
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
People are like

798
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
You're trying to put that billion dollar price tag

799
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Trying to figure out like

800
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
You know is this

801
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Big enough

802
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,720
Yeah and so in the middle it was really hard and

803
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
In the middle yeah that to raise money it was

804
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Is really fun though you are

805
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Profitable or on the way there

806
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Probability

807
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
And

808
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
I hated it like I hated raising money I didn't feel good at it

809
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,824
Like it wasn't my intention when I started the company let me do this with his little

810
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
Capital as I can

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,176
But after a couple of experiences with fundraising

812
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
I was like I want to do this is

813
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Littlest iPod

814
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
The meatball

815
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,624
Company is growing and then I guess we should we should mention here that

816
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,952
You guys employ a lot of data sign

817
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,536
Huge number

818
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Assertive

819
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Become like

820
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Company not

821
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
The fashion company

822
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
May I mean

823
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,544
Honestly from Day Zero with we were always a day to come

824
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Like even like those recurrent surveys that I just

825
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Even when

826
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,504
We were physically shipping the fixes out of our office and we didn't even have a website

827
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
We were collecting the data about

828
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
The product the attribute

829
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Is the product

830
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
And we were collecting

831
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
Physically with pen and paper your fee

832
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
Feedback about what you like

833
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
What you didn't like and what you thought of the

834
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Tyson Howard

835
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
And so

836
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,448
The data element was always super important but you know I don't think we were employing

837
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
True

838
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
Data science I would say

839
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
Until I mean I don't know

840
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
Is Eric

841
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,896
Are joined us in 2012

842
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
And air quality

843
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Sindhu

844
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
HughesNet

845
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,552
And he was a Daily Guide Netflix in your thinking

846
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
Wow man that doesn't get better than Netflix

847
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
Know what you want to watch

848
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Grab the remote control

849
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
Sprite and especially the time is it

850
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Before they're doing original Concha

851
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Don't like their whole thing with algorithms

852
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Recommendation

853
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,448
And he was like I'd Netflix we show you like a hunter recommendations at once and he was like we were just having this conversation

854
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
We're like if we were really bold

855
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
We would only show you 5 or 3

856
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
Or if we were really bald

857
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,872
When you open Netflix Regis start playing the content

858
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
That you would want to play

859
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
And

860
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
He's like that

861
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Kind of what you're doing here with

862
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,296
And so he was very attracted to

863
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,184
The fact that recommendations were like actually at the core of what we are doing you able to describe your company

864
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
In shorthand or did you ever described as Ehrlich on

865
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
I don't know but I don't really use that on a

866
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,168
But you know I think there are elements like we were

867
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
100% of our revenue is

868
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Tide

869
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
To recommendation

870
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
Like that's a very

871
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,128
Compelling thing to a data scientist who loves recommendations feeling like that's going to be at the

872
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Quorum

873
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
At what point did you become profitable

874
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,368
I'm we turn profitable we had a profitable quarter I think in mm

875
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
So it took you three years

876
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Just actually

877
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232
Super fast

878
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
How much

879
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Do you think about

880
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Competition

881
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Because there I mean

882
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
There are all kinds of

883
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,288
Potential competitors after other obvious from being Amazon

884
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Massive

885
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
Right and they

886
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Little fingers in every pie

887
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
You know

888
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
What's the weather like

889
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,064
Killer Avril like that thing that you guys have that

890
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Makes you

891
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Sustainable and resistance

892
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
22 Big Chill

893
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
Yeah I mean we

894
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
I would say that we pay attention to but don't obsess over

895
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Petitioning

896
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,936
I think when we think about what special about Stitch fix it's the one to one human connect

897
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Shenzhen in the recommendations

898
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
And so

899
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
You know some of the things that are really hard in today's e-commerce are like

900
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
If you want to find a pair of jeans that fit you like

901
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,016
It's not a great user experience that have literally a million pairs of jeans

902
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Did you ask Robin try to filter and sort

903
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,416
You know that's an example of a place where like the human element of like

904
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
And these jeans have strep through these Street

905
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,768
Jeans don't have straps in these are great for

906
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,376
People who are your height and we know that with data like all of those attributes

907
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,520
Are hugely important in helping you find which one of those millions of pairs of jeans are the right ones

908
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
Sing for you and so

909
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
You know there's a transacting part of e-commerce but before the transaction there's the discovery is like what is the thing that you're going to love

910
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,528
And that is a really hard problem to solve in today Z

911
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
E-commerce in one that I think we are uniquely good at

912
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
How many people by the way work for

913
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
I'm leave over

914
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
5000 in

915
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
And have a stylus

916
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Twerk because you got

917
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Hybrid model rightware

918
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
All these humans are

919
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Collaborating with

920
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
With algorithm

921
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
Yeah we have over 3000 Style

922
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,592
And and the way Stitch fix works of the integration of humans and data is that

923
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
They're both very kind of

924
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
Richly combined

925
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,736
And on and we see it as like they both are uniquely got it

926
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
And so

927
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
Like a stylist should never have

928
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
Have to worry about like you hate yellow or love

929
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Like the data can take

930
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,488
And so I'm the

931
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,096
Yellow and salmon

932
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
I need the Styles can see that but the data is going to

933
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
Exclude that from being able to be even available

934
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Hair stylist

935
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,872
And so on The Stylist will later on his or her own judgment over those records

936
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Condition to choose the right thing

937
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
News for you

938
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
And so in some cases the data science is going to be really active

939
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Sheraton like

940
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,856
Trying to figure out which jeans are best for you for example of the place where data science is

941
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
I'm enormous

942
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Helpful

943
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,720
And then there were other times when I'm this Stylus is layering on hue

944
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Human judgment

945
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,048
You took this company public

946
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Remember

947
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,168
Yeah people come at the first right

948
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Youngest

949
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Females

950
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
CEO

951
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
To ever take a company public

952
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
You know

953
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
Probably this year you will appear on

954
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Forbes

955
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
List of

956
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
Wealthiest self-made

957
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Women

958
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
As you became more and more prominent and

959
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
And the company became more profitable and you start to get more attention

960
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
All of a sudden you are sort of

961
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
A successful woman and Tack

962
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Kind of

963
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
I'm symbol

964
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Did that irritate you or

965
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
So did you

966
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Embrace it

967
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Initially or

968
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
How did you feel

969
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
You know that's an interesting one where I think

970
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
My mind is

971
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Change time

972
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,224
Maybe even in the last year or two years

973
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
At first I was really resistant to act like I really didn't like

974
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Being a successful

975
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Female CEO

976
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
Like I was like I just want to be a 6

977
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,072
And you know I think was changed about it now is that

978
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,192
When I wrote my application essay to HBS like I wrote about Meg Whitman

979
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
Female CEO in like

980
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:12,128
There were so few people like I I still very much admire her and I did admire her then but

981
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,456
They're very few people for me to choose from and saying like who I want

982
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
To be like

983
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
And I

984
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
Now that being able to be

985
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
Part of what

986
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,952
Opens people's lens of possibility more I think is really powerful and

987
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm so I think now like I'm

988
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't know kind of

989
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Proud to be able to be part of that and

990
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
Like I'm very happy to wear that label and I'm very

991
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
You know I think it's

992
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,520
Good for people to be able to see more examples of what

993
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,592
Success can look like that maybe are different from what it's

994
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Look like

995
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
There was a story I don't want to keep

996
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
Now I bet you're so go that at a certain point

997
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
In your journey through his money

998
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
You experience harassment

999
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
From a prominent

1000
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
Partner at a prominent Venture Capital firm

1001
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,816
They released a statement of Entry saying something like you know we should have done better

1002
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Like that

1003
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
What was that a common experience for you

1004
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
But I can't speak to that

1005
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Specific example

1006
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
But

1007
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,336
And I think that there were real challenges with

1008
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,896
That power Dynamic I think of

1009
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
You know who has

1010
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,968
The power and who has the money and who

1011
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
Doesn't use standing in front of a room of

1012
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Man

1013
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Yeah

1014
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,136
And I think the

1015
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Dark elements of it.

1016
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
Just feel structurally unfair that

1017
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
And I don't think that solved unless you

1018
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
To change the

1019
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
Proportion of

1020
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
Men and women that are in liters

1021
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
And so

1022
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,704
You know I mean they're examples where like I was

1023
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
And I was at a conference

1024
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
Anchor soccer was on stage like

1025
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
Hundreds of people at the room like this isn't a secret he was

1026
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Things publicly

1027
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
And Chris like he's at he's a venture cap

1028
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,504
Yeah and one of the things he was saying was he was like look like I am

1029
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,880
You're not a typical Venture capitalists like I don't have an office in San Francisco like I just I live up in Tahoe in like

1030
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Be entrepreneurs they come to me in like

1031
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,512
They come and hang out with me and Tahoe and they like drink beer is in my hot tub and

1032
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
Like I get to know them in their businesses and like

1033
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:12,448
Yeah there's part of that that you're like oh cool like that's different but like if you think about it like I'm sitting in the audience

1034
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
I think I was pregnant

1035
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
What time am I sitting in the audience

1036
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
I'm pregnant I'm like

1037
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
I'm not going to come meet you

1038
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Bikini and I can't

1039
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,480
Even coming to your hot tub because I'm pregnant and I can't drink your beer is because I'm pregnant and like

1040
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,112
You know there's just all of these structural elements that like just make it harder and more challenging in like

1041
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
You know you just

1042
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:36,000
Realize like well I guess I'm never going to be able to be in his Pipeline and like that's okay but like it's just

1043
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
There few or is it just challenging

1044
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Yo is there a nurse

1045
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Tone deafness

1046
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
Diane and I

1047
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
I'm wondering if

1048
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
Since you know more and more of this

1049
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Stuff is coming out in more people talking about it

1050
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
And we had Jenn Hyman on the show and she's

1051
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
Talk about her experience

1052
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
With Rent the Runway

1053
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,479
Whether I'm some of that

1054
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
Is trickling down in a way that

1055
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Starting to change

1056
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
Behavior I don't know do you

1057
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Are you hearing that

1058
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
But anyway

1059
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
I certainly hope it is

1060
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,863
And I don't want to make it seem like everything is super unfair and that everybody Zachary feel like that's that's really not the case

1061
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Say hi

1062
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Great partners

1063
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Asterism by and large I think

1064
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
You have good intentions

1065
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
I do genuinely hope that it

1066
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
It's getting better and then

1067
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
People are at least more wear

1068
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,407
And so you know my hope is at least

1069
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Being able to see this

1070
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Success stories

1071
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Create another

1072
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Pattern

1073
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Jennifer bench

1074
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,879
That you will lose to earlier which is that

1075
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,695
In the midst of all this like in the midst of building this company

1076
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
You've got married and had a child too

1077
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Yeah

1078
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Alger canal

1079
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
He is

1080
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
17 months

1081
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
I mean

1082
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
That's a lot of hours

1083
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,007
Yeah it's a lot and it is

1084
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,639
I don't know that I ever actively was thinking like I have this company and like I also need to

1085
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
Have my life and you know I

1086
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
But it was like I in the time of the company

1087
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
I met my husband I got married

1088
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
Baby like me I've gone through a lot of life

1089
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,903
Transitions through the company and

1090
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,279
And I think it's really healthy because I think you know in a lot of ways your company feels like

1091
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Your

1092
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
Kind of baby and you're only thing and

1093
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
And I think I was

1094
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Lucky fortunate like

1095
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,543
You know whatever it is to be able to have had the space in my life to also be able to do

1096
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
Have those miles to your mom yet

1097
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
So I should admit that I get knocked

1098
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
James from

1099
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
To listen who said you know you

1100
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
You you don't ask

1101
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Batman about

1102
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
Their children

1103
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
As much as you are

1104
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
Ask women and so I've been more mantle

1105
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Doing that

1106
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,231
I think the one difference though is that you know

1107
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
As a woman you are caring but

1108
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
A child for 9 months

1109
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
And running the company

1110
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
I mean that

1111
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
That's very different that is a

1112
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
That's a really

1113
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
It's a challenge meme

1114
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Physically

1115
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
It's challenging and then

1116
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
You also have to put

1117
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
Put your emotional energy into your business

1118
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
Yeah right

1119
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
No it's and it's

1120
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
Different you know like you show up at meetings and you're like 8 months

1121
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
And like

1122
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
Your people didn't really know how to react

1123
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,647
Should I unlike had a hard time navigating and I don't blame them because it's like

1124
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,975
Like I took a 16-week maternity leave

1125
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
I was out of the office

1126
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
16 weeks

1127
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
Unplugged

1128
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:24,959
Yeah I mean I'd there a couple things that I did I did some recruiting things like there are some things that I see you like only I

1129
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
I could do I like

1130
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,287
I pretty much didn't set foot in the office

1131
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
For 16 weeks

1132
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,871
And you know that's the example that I have

1133
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Very female employee

1134
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
Dislike

1135
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:39,039
If I'm not honoring the maternity leave policy that we have like how are people going to feel comfortable

1136
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,855
Yeah feeling like it's the right thing to do

1137
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
C weeks

1138
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
You're the sentiment

1139
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
That I want to ask you

1140
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Churches that

1141
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Pretty early on

1142
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
In Billings

1143
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Are you

1144
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
You parted ways with your

1145
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Co-founder

1146
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
What's the story meaning

1147
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Just have a different sense of

1148
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
What you

1149
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Wanted to do

1150
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,359
Yeah it's a microphone and I we parted ways and

1151
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
The summer of 2000

1152
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
June 12th

1153
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
And

1154
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
It was a me night

1155
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
Define a lot of

1156
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
If I can share on it but

1157
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Like it was really hard and it

1158
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:17,951
Like in a divorce he talked about like irreconcilable differences and like

1159
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
I feel like

1160
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,863
Through that I really understood what that meant a like if you can be in a place where you really deeply care for somebody

1161
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
+

1162
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
The same time you

1163
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
See things so differently and

1164
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Can't

1165
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
Can't see

1166
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
The future in the same

1167
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Do you

1168
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Do you think that would that be

1169
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,943
People who start up businesses are better off doing it on their own

1170
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Oh I don't know I mean

1171
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,087
Starting a company is subject

1172
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Team sport

1173
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
You know I look back and I

1174
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,231
Could not have done it without

1175
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
The many

1176
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,839
Employees who believed in at the many clients who believes in that the like

1177
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
My friends

1178
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Coup

1179
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
I didn't go to their wedding because I would like to pour into busy at the time and like I mean there's just like it's

1180
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Such a team

1181
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Sport and you have to

1182
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Surround yourself with

1183
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
People who

1184
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
Help you to achieve those goals and

1185
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,271
Does that mean you have to have a co-founder or not like I don't know but like

1186
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,807
I couldn't imagine

1187
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
Having done it without having a network of people who believe Katrina Lake founder

1188
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,559
Love Stitch fix a company which by the way is now valued at over

1189
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
2 billion dollars

1190
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
And on the day the company actually went public

1191
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,983
Katrina had some help from her one-year-old

1192
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
Who is ringing the NASDAQ Bell while she was holding him

1193
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,663
He was holding the stuffed animal and I was holding him during the dress rehearsal like practice

1194
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
The thing that in a go to the motions and he was like really chill at happy to be up there and I was kind of like

1195
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:54,463
All right we're going to get this way he's going to be up here and this are going to do it anymore so you spit up all over me in the

1196
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
I mean that that's the funny thing is like if I had planned to have them up there there's no way it would have worked like he was

1197
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,471
He's a year old whatever like you wasn't going to cooperate but

1198
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
The Stars aligned and

1199
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
It worked

1200
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,223
And stick around because it just

1201
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,527
The moment we're going to hear from you about the things

1202
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Your building

1203
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
But first I quit thanks to one of our sponsors Starbucks

1204
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
For the first time in 43

1205
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
3 years

1206
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Starbucks

1207
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Introducing a second

1208
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Nespresso

1209
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
Starbucks Blonde.

1210
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
It's smooth and subtly

1211
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
So whatever your drink is

1212
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Triad with

1213
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
Starbucks Blonde

1214
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Nespresso

1215
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

1216
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Time now for how you

1217
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
You built that

1218
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
This is Brian Sonia Wallace

1219
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
Tapping away on his

1220
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
Vintage Smith Corona typewriter

1221
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Apartment in Los Angeles

1222
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,903
He uses it for his business which is

1223
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Writing poetry

1224
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
On demand

1225
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
Poetry is

1226
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
Like the ultimate non-commercial

1227
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,959
You know unless you're a professor or an Instagram celebrity poet you're you're really not usually making aloe

1228
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Living doing this

1229
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
What about 4 years ago

1230
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,591
Brian sort of stumbled into the poultry business

1231
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
When he was laid off from his job

1232
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Writing grants for a non-profit

1233
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
He always likes reading

1234
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Poetry

1235
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Hey you know maybe I should just

1236
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,343
Set up a typewriter in public in

1237
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
Sell my poems to

1238
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,159
People passing by

1239
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,207
I thought okay let me see if I can

1240
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,583
Pay my rent for one month it was this experiment in

1241
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,679
Whether you could make any money off of this poetry thing

1242
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:44,543
Surprise started to show up at Arts festivals and other events around town with his

1243
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
Typewriter

1244
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
And a small table I originally had a sign that said give me a topic I'll write you a poem pay me what you think it's worth

1245
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:57,855
And it turns out people would pay anywhere between five and $40 for a custom poem

1246
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,695
About their boyfriends or their girlfriends even about their dogs

1247
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
End of that month

1248
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
Brian had earned enough money to pay his rent

1249
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
And his utilities and it was funny because after the month I was like okay well now I'm going to hang my typewriter up and focus on other thing

1250
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
And I kept getting calls from either people who I had met on the street or people who had seen

1251
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
Something about it

1252
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
Asking me to do private event

1253
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,015
But when it came to private events

1254
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
Ryan had no idea what

1255
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:34,719
To charge my remember there were a couple early ones once in particular I remember I'd like an investment banking conference

1256
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,631
And I didn't really understand that you could set up Baseline price and that people had

1257
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:48,031
Budgets and would pay for event entertainment at the Mall of America where people lined up

1258
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,567
App for custom poems

1259
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,639
Including one particularly interesting custom

1260
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
Did my usual open Hi how are you what do you need a poem about

1261
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,575
She thought for a minute she said you know I've actually just come from

1262
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,159
A week-long silent Meditation Retreat

1263
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
It was really

1264
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,023
Intense and emotional and so I just came to get some Dippin Dots as a reward

1265
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Sir Brian got to work

1266
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,911
And a few minutes later

1267
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
He presented her with

1268
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
The poem

1269
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
It's scary

1270
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
How hectic

1271
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823

00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
And no release valve

1275
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Do we implode

1276
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,367
That woman ended up hugging Brian after he read her that poem apparently it happens to him a lot

1277
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,207
Finding a lightness that starts deep

1278
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,511
In the corner of my belly

1279
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,303
And ends
