Hughes before

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
But the company she started radio one

Omaha Nebraska

40
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Even when she was little

41
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
She couldn't stop talking about

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
She wanted to do

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
I wanted to be the

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
First African American

45
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
To have a syndicated radio show

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
I've had that desire since I was

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
8 9 10 years ago out

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
So you want to do from childhood

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
It's so interesting

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
When I go back to the high school that I graduated from that every single solitary week send a note home to my

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
My mother seeing she talks too much

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Like I'm practicing for my future career

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Eye of

54
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Grew up in a household where they were sick

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
One back

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,248
And I did my radio show every morning in the mirror with the two

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Toothbrush

58
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
And no matter how many blows my brothers and sister with ghettout Heap upon my head when I finally opened the bathroom

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Door so they can get ready for school now

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
I never

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
Came out of that bathroom every morning

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
Until I finish my radio show

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Everyone thought at that time there was something wrong with me

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
I mean

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
There are no black people in radio Pachuca Lino black women could begin remember we're isolated in the middle of the United

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
In the 1950

67
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
Is it 1950s exactly

68
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
And so they thought I had a pipe dream by nuns at my school described it as delusions

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
The branch

70
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
Tell my mother that she perhaps you seek

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Sling for Mac

72
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Because I had this vision

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
I being on the radio and

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
People hearing me from coast to coast

75
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
I guess you have a stream and a lot of people think you're crazy but you

76
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
I want to pursue it

77
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
But then

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
As a teenager I guess

79
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Steam to get

80
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Get pregnant

81
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
First sexually

82
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Variance

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm in the doctor

84
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
What is all the tea tells me I'm pregnant I said I couldn't be able to have sex one time

85
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
Is I hate to surprise you Kathy but it only takes one time God

86
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
Arranged it that way you shocked when you found

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Arrested Development

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
No question about it I went into a satyr

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
State of shock but

90
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
I realized

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
That I had

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Mission I had an obligation

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Did someone greater than myself

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
And I was determined that he wouldn't be a black scientist

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,711
I was determined that he and I would not grow up in the public housing

96
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
That I have grown up in

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
I was determined

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,135
That he was going to have an opportunity which meant that I had to be very serious

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Purpose

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Why was still

101
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
Young teenager a child myself

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
But still pretty hard you know.

103
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Try to support yourself and your

104
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Child

105
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
Yes but I'm third-generation entrepreneur

106
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
So I grew up having to work in a family business

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,871
110 years ago my grandfather started to school after being the first black

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
To get his EDD

109
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Comparable to a PhD

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
And my father was

111
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
The first African American to graduate from Creighton University with a

112
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Degree in accounting

113
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
He opened up a tax service

114
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
And I was in charge of the Prentice Hall Ledger switch where all the tax regulations that changed every week

115
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
I

116
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Typing

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,239
10 years old I was taking shorthand by the time I was twelve and having to be proficient at it because

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
I was a staff person

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,871
My family kept imposing upon me to come to work okay

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
So even though you know pregnant is sick

121
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
16 a mother at 17

122
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,063
Sounds like how did you do it financially while I was already working

123
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
And I was very blessed

124
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
I say this too young but this is easy to be a teenage mama

125
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
When the baby still in

126
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Infancy

127
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Because

128
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
All they do is eat

129
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Go to the bathroom and sleep

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
That's all they doing cry little MBA

131
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Between

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
And so I could take him to class with me

133
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
When you enrolled you enrolled

134
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
University

135
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,199
Yeah and I took him a lot of University of Nebraska at Omaha

136
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
I have put him right he be riding a carriage on the floor

137
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Add butt

138
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
It became a problem once he got up

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Start walking

140
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
An Institute

00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159

A voice for us in Omaha

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
In the city that was

146
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Severely sacred

147
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
I read that

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
And give me you're wasting your talents in Omaha Nebraska

157
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
You need to be

158
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
Where you can really have an opportunity

159
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
To do

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
What you want to do what you do with radio

161
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
10 years later

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
He was offered the opportunity to establish the Howard University School of communication

163
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Has he became the first

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
And he asked me if I was interested in coming to Washington DC

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
So you move

166
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
Halfway across the country

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
For five year old son

168
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
At the point and

169
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,111
Find apartment and you start working to see that you did not know you had got lost

170
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
I can't tell you how many times I would go out New York Avenue

171
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
And get lost or I'd go out a street that hits name change Virginia some mornings

172

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
I told her that my eyes actually work

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
Tired at the end of the day staring at the greatness of

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Black people

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,807
I had never seen so many wonderful people of color doing so many wonderful thing

180
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
I actually put in a letter to my mother that my eyes

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
Retired at the end of the day of just staring

182
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
It was a person. Still am to be very honest

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071

Keto diet and weight

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,247
Doing my whole generation in the nation's capital is Ali gotten better

190
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,623
I've gone from watching a black mirror get elected to watching a black president get elected

191
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Okay sweets

192
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
You get to

193
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Howard and

194
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
DC and

195
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
I was the sales manager

196
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,519
Play music at that time

197
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Play jazz

198
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
One night

199
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
They did an 18 minutes

200
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Long

201
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Piece of Pharoah Sanders

202
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
And I think he held the note the entire time

203
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Okay

204
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
18 minute jazz song all you heard was this one

205
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
And I was like I can't

206
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Celibate

207
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
So your job was to find advertisers to advertise

208
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Is on the house but also to help

209
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Define

210
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
How the radio

211
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Just a mess oh my God

212
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
It was it sounds like the kind of place

213
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Cuz it was a mess

214
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
A young person like

215
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
Opportunity in your 20s

216
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
Could take it over absolutely and the fact

217
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
That the den Dien

218
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
With a big fan

219
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Of my work at

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
I think he said you need to see can you teach these kids how to work like you folks or Nebraska work

221
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
I always believe

222
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Bad rising at 4 a.m.

223
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
And then getting dressed

224
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
I'm leaving

225
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
By 5:15 5:30 for the office

226
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
That was just my lifestyle

227
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Amston Lake

228
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,407
I have been reared to believe which again so critical

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Entrepreneur

230
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
Bet you don't stop based on what the clock says

231
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,831
You stopped based on the accomplishment of the task

232
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
July

233
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
You're in DC with your son by the way how are you doing all this is

234
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Is a single mom

235
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
We Are One

236
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,911
Often times people ask me do I get if I had anything to do over what would it be it would be to have more chill

237
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
It was easy with him remember I told you start off taking him to college with me

238
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
So

239
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,175
He had his first little tuxedo before he was at a great school cuz he was my date I took him everywhere

240
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
I had a sleeping bag in my office

241
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
We have dinner together we would do his homework

242
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
Then I put him in the sleeping bag until it was time for me to take him home

243
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,231
I didn't know anybody I didn't have anyone to leave him with

244
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,863
So what were you able to do at the station at that time I mean you get there as early 70s

245
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
The first thing was to create struct

246
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
Do I realize that the first thing they needed

247
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
It was an understanding of the atom

248
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Ignoring opportunity

249
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Keep giving them

250
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
So how are you able to

251
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
The Quiet Storm

252
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Tell me about The Quiet Storm

253
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
It was simply

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
Recognition of the fact that the city had a size of

255
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Population of single

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
Unattached human beings who

257
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Still wanted to

258
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
To feel good about a Friday night or Saturday night

259
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
All they were missing

260
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Was the entertainment

261
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
So I structured

262
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
File format called The Quiet Storm

263
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
This is your picture.

264
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,847
The basically was a 5-hour

265
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Presentation

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,735
Entertaining you at home by yourself and do you company do that

267
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
With the selection of music

268
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Before Hip Hop

269
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
If you were going to be

270
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
Successful in the world of black music

271
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
You had to tell me

272
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Story with your music

273
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
And so all I did was

274
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
To weave those

275
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Stories together

276
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
What were you playing

277
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Oh

278
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Sam Cooke

279
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
Carmen McRae

280
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,431
Dybala tears basically

281
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
How did that show takeoff how to become popular

282
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Well I hit the right

283
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Target demo

284
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
And I guess we should mention that the audience was

285
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Predominately African-American

286
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
Interesting Lee enough my first audience

287
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Escape predominately gay

288
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,167
I put the first openly gay are personality on the are at Howard and almost lost the top of my head

289
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Because of it

290
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
So the gay community absolutely love the quiet storm and then the black community Michael

291
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,711
Great it's absolutely Word of Mouth

292
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
And it went from like number 36 in the ratings

293
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,927
It's to like top 5 and it when I left we were number three so you have this incredibly successful

294
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
What career at whur-fm decide

295
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,839
You know I think I can do this on my own like no it not at all not at all

296
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,935
There was a group of investors called the Washington broadcast

297
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
And it's 32 board members and investors

298
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,639
Stay included some of the most distinguished black-and-white washingtonians

299
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
They had tried

300
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
4

301
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Well over a decade

302
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
To get a

303
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Signal that was dark back on the air

304
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,439
They've gone through millions of dollars and they could not get the signal

305
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
Only are they wanted to revive a radio

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,119
Yes they wanted this dark signal they had lkmm but they had spent all

307
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
They spent their money in all the wrong places

308
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
They approached me

309
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
And offered me

310
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Double quit Howard University

311
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
He was paying me but more importantly they offered me the opportunity to build

312
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Substation from the ground up

313
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
So these owners they they bought the station and they hired you to run

314
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Yes

315
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
They hired me to get it on the air

316
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Then they hired me to run it

317
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
Then they ran out of money so they told me to shop a package for financing

318
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,607
And I said to them that that's not the responsibility of a general manager

319
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Did I will do that

320
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,471
If you give me an equity position in your company

321
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
And one of the members said to me

322
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
If you think that you're smart enough to own a radio station you should do it for yourself we're not giving you any equity in arts

323
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Station

324
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
He was being facetious but

325
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
I took it verbatim

326
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Seriously

327
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
I was like oh my

328
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
He was right I should do it for myself guy I'm not exaggerating

329
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
It was like a charge went through me I said oh my goodness

330
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
This person who's a multimillionaire who I have been admired who's now probably in their 70s

331
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Is saying to me here I am to know

332
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Billy 30

333
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
I'm smart enough to do this with them

334
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Eddie's challenging me

335
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
If I think I should own part of their station do it for myself

336
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
Thank you Lord I hear you I hear you I literally

337
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623

00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Down the hallway from the board meeting

341
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Alien life

342
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
What just happened

343
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Did she have a nervous breakdown or something I knew what I was destined to do

344
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Cathy Hughes founder of radio one coming up the story of how she did

345
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
End up buying a first radio station the first of dozens and how it goes really days and she live

Dewey Hughes and I were married at that time and he at worked at the station

390
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
So when do we went to the owner and said

Did you get a bankson

395
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031

Estheticians and all of them said no

399
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
We're not going to give you a million.

400
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,783
And you should because none of them had

401
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
And all of them said no

402
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
We're not going to give you a million.

403
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,439
They asked me questions like that I plan to have any more children

404
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
They asked me if

405
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Did not think that I was

406
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
Too young to be doing this taking on that level of responsibility

407
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
They asked me questions

408
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
Since it had nothing to do more often than not

409
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
How did you go to

410
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
2:30

411
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055

Get rejected

413
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Affectionate

414
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
Show me the number I told you that my father was a CPA

415

424
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,679
Puerto Rican and she probably guess that it would be a male

425
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Cuz she was bored

426
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
She said yes and I just kept by now

427
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
My presentation

428
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Should have been taught in

429
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Oncologist

430
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
Was flawless I mean after 32 times of perfect okay

00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Condensing her

433
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
And she said something to me that I teach you all myself

434
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
She said

435
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Please don't

436
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Self pass

437
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Close

438
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
And I never forgot that cuz that was another one of those slap-in-the-face as I was like wow she's absolutely correct she said

439
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
I couldn't believe she is

440
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,055
What you said yes you kept telling her on

441
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,919
I kept trying to convince

442
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:35,039
So you get the money and you buy this

443
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Station

444
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Where was it by the way

445
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
1680 Wisconsin Ave

446
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
And you walk in that part of Georgetown

447
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
In the highest tradition

448
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Adversity

449
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
So that's why I moved into

450
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Wheatley sorry start

451
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
You because I had to pay rent in Georgetown

452
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:03,199
And 1680 Wisconsin was then and still is a beautiful valuable diagonal

453
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,599
Please set on the corner piece of property made it real convenient to go to work in the morning I walk down the hall

454
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Son and husband

455
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
I know I moved in there with my

456
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Said by then my husband was like

457
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
Enough I don't want to do this is your marriage

458
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Fell apart absolutely the station broker

459
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
The debt

460
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Was just

461
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
Overwhelming for him getting ever been an entrepreneur

462
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
Never having been in business before Eva

463
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
So it's just me and the kid

464
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
How many years did you guys

465
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Junior Summer

466
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Almost three

467
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
No

468
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,087
Number one that can remember the part of the story I told you that I was just in awe of what

469
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,743
See I'm in Georgetown I've been able to move back there yet okay during my struggling days

470
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
I had

471
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,119
A prime Corners you would see the president having dinner at one of the restaurants

472
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Under

473
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
A lot of financial

474
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Pressure right

475
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
So how did you deal with that

476
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
When you have overwhelming Financial

477
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Applications

478
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
The first natural

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:07,199
Human impulses to hijack to recoil not return the call

480
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
What would I have been trained to do

481
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
Display offense

482
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Not defense

483
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
So I would call

484
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
My lenders

485
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
And I would say I know I owe you ten

486
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
All I have is $1,250

487
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
I'm sending it to you

488
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
As a token

489
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
Good faith that I will repay you every since

490
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
That I owe you but right now this is all I have

491
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
And most of them

492
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
Said that they had never ever interacted with anyone who let them know up front that they could not

493
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
I think that is the reason I've never been foreclosed on I've never had to file for bankruptcy and thing

494
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,952
Thank God I have never had a paycheck bounced I've never had a business check

495
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Nor personal check balance

496
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Because I tried to stay ahead

497
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
Of the issue of not being able to pee

498
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
The dead people

499
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Like we're depending on you

500
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Are salaries right

501
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
I was running a

502
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
24-hour seven-day-a-week broadcastify

503
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
Facility with 14

504
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Full and part-time employees

505
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Total

506
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:18,112
14 of us and you were one of the people who went on the only thing I don't know how to do a spider up the transmitter who had to go

507
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
On the air

508
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Because you didn't have enough

509
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
And what did you do just opened up the mics

510
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Start talking

511
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Well it started off

512
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Because

513
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
We did for the color format

514
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
And we found out it was missing in Washington DC

515
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Was news

516
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Talk from a black

517
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Perspective

518
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Put that research did not

519
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
As you well know here NPR is the most

520
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Expensive format that you can do

521
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,504

Play the music read the news do everything

523
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
It's a one-person

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
When you talk about

525
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
News

526
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512

527
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Researches critic

528
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840

Someone you're listening audience who knows more than you

530
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168

00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Waiting there in the cut

532
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Oh no that's not correct okay

533
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
You can't do it by yourself

534
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
In this format

535
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
How are you able to run

536
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
The station administer the station

537
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Deal with the stress of all that

538
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528

00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
But that's

545
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
When you said the stress of the debt it was

546
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
Don't stress I have no doubt that I was

547
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
Either you need to brag

548
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752

00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
I used to tell them

555
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
You will make more money off me and my cup

556
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:01,024
You've made off anyone in now this is what I'm also telling them that I can't make my payment this month

557
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
If you think

558
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Oh it's overwhelming

559
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
I've got all this dick

560
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
I can't sell anything

561
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,520
I'm working 18 20 hours a day

562
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
Then it's too hard

563
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
You can't do it

564
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
But when you know

565
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
That the day is going to arrive

566
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
When you're going to have enough money to pay everyone that's what you have to see in your mind's eye that's what you have to boo-boo

567
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
And I saw her

568
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
Yeah I knew it I could feel it

569
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
And that's when I was in the sleeping bag

570
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,864
Cooking on a hot plate and washing up in the public bathroom in the radio station at 6

571
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
1680 Wisconsin

572
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
I felt it I knew it

573
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
I just knew I had to

574
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
The hold on

575
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
And when

576
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
You're starting off in business

577
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Have to be so very cure

578
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
About who

579
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
You discuss your heart times

580
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
Because those who love you and care for you

581
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
The most like your mother

582
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
Like your best friend

583
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,136
Don't give you the worst damn advice in the world

584
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
You need to get a job

585
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,768
You shouldn't be sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag

586
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,608
What type of environment is that for a child

587
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
Kathy was

588
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
The station

589
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Profitable Pro

590
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Pretty quickly

591
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
7 years

592
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
So what was it

593
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
That made you guys

594
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
How did you get to

595
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
How did you get Jaden Yuki profitability

596
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
Doctor Martin Luther

597
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Sweeping the floor

598
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Date

599
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
The best of Europe

600
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
In one day

601
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
The world is going to say nobody

602
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Sweep the floor better than

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
So it is that when you started

604
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Yes I realize

605
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Stead

606
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
I could not

607
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,800
Survive we just a little thousand watt a.m. that I had to grow I either had to grow or I have to go

608
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
In Richmond

609
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Stations yes

610
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
Because our specialty is weird turn around

611
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
What they all have in common

612
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
De-stress station got it

613
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
We took distressed properties and turn them around

614
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Because we could afford them

615
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Did you get the money to buy them

616
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,512
Again if your lenders know that their money is good with you they give you more

617
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
Alright lenders don't invest

618
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
And ideas everybody's got ideas

619
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
The invest in you

620
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
People loan money to the

621
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Person not to the business

622
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
To the idea

623
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
They have to feel good about you

624
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
How many stations

625
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Did you eventually

626
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Bye

627
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
Fake that we were up to think 35

628
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
So

629
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
What

630
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Was the point where you sad

631
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Let's go public

632
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:41,536
Let's make this and that you've 38.5 I did my son went to Wharton and got his MBA

633
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
And walking across

634
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Campus

635
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Of UPN

636
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
My son says

637
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Tumi

638
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Do you still believe that we have to grow Argo

639
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Nice of course I believe we got to go

640
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
He said that we have to

641
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Because we started

642
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
And with the deregulation

643
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,320
11% of all radio stations in the United States of America home by one company

644
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
It's kind of hard to compete

645
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
Could you over here with two or three I mean they would come into a market they have five Power House Radio

646
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Stations with one format

647
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Eliminated all the competition

648
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
So we knew we would that we had to grow in

649
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
Scale we had to get much larger head so yes

650
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
We had to go public we had no choice

651
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,920
A lot of people told us that they didn't think that they would be a wise decision

652
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,272
For us I tried to discourage us we had a couple fall start

653
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,136
But it was the best thing they could have happened ad

654
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
The other thing that we have done

655
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
In our company as we stay in our Lane

656
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
We're not trying to open a restaurant

657
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,376
You're not trying to go into concert promotion

658
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
We stay in

659
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
The Telecommunications

660
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Industry

661
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
At the height of already won how many

662
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,128
How many stations did you guys actually have

663
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,944
75 stations which was the height when we bought

664
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
A package of stations from Clear Channel

665
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
75 they had never been done and urban broadcasting before were you able to retain a significant

666
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Share of the ownership after you went public

667
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Yes

668
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,352
Not just own but also the voting stock

669
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
Which owl has again been a blessing

670
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
The same syndicated Communications

671
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:30,336
37 years ago who sit down and showed me how to write my first business plan

672
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
They're still in business

673
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Sex with me

674
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
You haven't really talked about his

675
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Discrimination

676
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Because

677
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
You must have

678
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
A lot of it not only as woman but

679
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
Is an African American woman

680
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Yes

681
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
One of the the issues that has always faced

682
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
Entrepreneurs of

683
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Is

684
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
The

685
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,192
Lack of available

686
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Capital

687
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,544
Put them to go into business or to maintain their business

688
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
I remember there was a bank

689
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
NDC rig

690
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
And I had a big contract

691
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
But the payment

692
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Coming in slow

693
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
And

694
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,624
It was so interesting because a black Banker

695
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Deutsche bank

696
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Said to me you would loan her 50

697
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
$10,000 to buy a car

698
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
But you won't loan her 10000

699
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Dollars to make her payroll

700
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,936
And yet she has the contracts showing that the money will be coming in

701
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,336
So often has been easier for entrepreneur to buy a new flashy car

702
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:40,736
And it's been for them to meet payroll which is the tragedy of us not having as many lending Institution

703
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
Actions in our community as we need and want

704
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Just like I still

705
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
Which is

706
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
You face

707
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
All these challenges and you kept

708
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Golang

709
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
What was it that kept you going

710
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
A belief in God

711
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,960
Because when you really believe in God you can believe in yourself

712
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
As I said

713
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Betty I quit my job

714
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,336
Not knowing where the next

715
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
Piece of money was trying to come from where the next chapter

716
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,992
Who's going to come from I knew that I would be sitting here today talking to you

717
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
I believed it because

718
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
I believe in the power

719
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
The Creator

720
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,464
And I used to never ever

721
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,560
Give a speech for accepting award writing first

722
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Thank God

723
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
And I still do but back then when I first started

724
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
They said to me they ain't nobody

725
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Interesting all that religious I said that's not religious

726
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,848
That spirituality there's a big difference in my book

727
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,688
Between being loyal and understanding

728
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,504
Yourself in relationship to Creation

729
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
I have one last question

730
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
This energy this glow this

731
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
Choice

732
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Passionate

733
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Intensity that

734
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
And in this

735
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Unshakable

736
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Belief

737
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Will work

738
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Is it something that

739
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
You have that

740
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
That is

741
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
Specific to you or do you think it's something people

742
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Can actually learn

743
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Oh

744
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
Definitely an acquired skill

745
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
If you

746
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Allow yourself

747
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
To be

748
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,760
Bog down and lose your enthusiasm

749
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
Then you're dead in the water

750
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,904
But if you remain optimistic

751
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,488
Cheerful and committed to your goals

752
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
There's nothing that can stop you

753
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,800
Cathy Hughes founder of radio one company is now called Urban one

754
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:47,200
By the way Kathy son Alfred that little kid in the baby tuxedo he is now the CEO of the

755
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Company

756
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,728
And please stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the

757
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Things your building

758
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,128
The first two quick things to one of our sponsors think about your eyes.com

759
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
So much of what kids learn

760
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Come through their eyes

761
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Take care of them by visiting an eye doctor yearly

762
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
5 1

763
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
Think about your eyes.com

764
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,256
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

765
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,608
And I'll tell you the story that we first ran in January

766
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
It's from Nashville Tennessee

767
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
My name is

768
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Dr Mike Butera

769
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,848
I'm the founder and CEO of artifen makes musical instruments which

770
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
What's a natural mood for my

771
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,456
Because he plays like a few dozen instruments himself

772
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,576
Dinner party with a bunch of Musician's Friend

773
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
Then after dinner we wanted to play music together

774
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
But we didn't have any instruments

775
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
We just had

776
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
The phones in our pockets

777
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
So they hooked up their phones to computer speakers

778
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
Launch some music making apps

779
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Start the jam

780
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
But we were just staring at our screens

781
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
We really wanted to interact with each other or

782
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,712
Get lost in the Music close our eyes like Mick Jagger Keith Richards

783
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
And then

784
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Mike had an idea

785
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
I thought what is the speaker had a guitar

786
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
What is this speaker had

787
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
Keys on it what if it have a little drum pad

788
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
I just wanted the speaker to become

789
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
A musical instrument

790
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
So am I called up some of his

791
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Engineer friends and ask them

792
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Album billboard

793
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,264
This is what they made

794
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,848
My digital instrument that looks kind of like the neck of a guitar

795
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
Sounds like well

796
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Like almost every instrument

797
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
You can imagine

798
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
It has a fingerboard and a row of buttons that can be streamed

799
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,952
What's happening

800
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Can hold it like

801
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Guitar

802
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,608
You can hold it upright like an upright Bass

803
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:18,496
But you can also set it down on the table or your lap and play it like that

804
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
Piano or drum pad

805
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,968
And when you put it on the violin setting you can actually hold your iPhone out

806
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,040
Move your iPhone around in the air

807
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,392
And that will act like a bow

808
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,512
Mike says it took them that 6 years to get the instrument

809
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Just the way they wanted

810
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
Which isn't necessarily A

811
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
Silicon Valley style way to do it

812
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
It

813
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,008
What's more in arkaso a Nashville

814
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,152
Which is go into Studios with musicians and see what works and go back and refine it and and really

815
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,456
Look at the craft of building this

816
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
Since we last spoke with Mike

817
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,856
He's raised over $1000000 on Kickstarter and he's been selling his device

818
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
Just called instrument one

819
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
On Amazon and Urban Outfitters

820
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
And last month

821
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,536
Mike picked up some of the instruments

822
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
Took them to a big music retailers convention and well if they was kind of daunting

823
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,496
Against the big players in the industry

824
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Fender and Gibson

825
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,848
Yamaha and Korg and Roland

826
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Yeah and we're in this little booth

827
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Next to the wall

828
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,016
But a lot of people stopped at the booth and tried out the instrument

829
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
We got best in show

830
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Which was

831
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
Great especially because

832
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,976
We looked very different than most of the instruments

833
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,560
But because instrument one is so different

834
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
It's been kind of hard for Mike to attract investors

835
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
We talked with a lot of feces around the country

836
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
And they say

837
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,312
Hardware is not quite as hot as it used to be where more into software now

838
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Figure that out

839
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
Get profitable as a hardware startup

840
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Then we'd be interested in helping you scale as a software startup

841
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
So Mike is still trying to work out how to make

842
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
The instrument one profitable

843
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,208
Since he launched it two years ago he sold about 5000 of them

844
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
And now he even has a small team of people working with

845
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
We've had

846
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
A great time

847
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,216
Getting out there seeing the music people are making even just this morning someone posted

848
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,312
A brand new video of this one man band Jam next to a river

849
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Just amazing stuff everyday

850
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
