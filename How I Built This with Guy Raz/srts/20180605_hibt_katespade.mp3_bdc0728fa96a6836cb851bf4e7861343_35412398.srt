Hey it's guy here

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,040
So we've been hearing from a lot of you

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,344
Until we all found out the tragic news

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
About

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Kate Spade

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
And her husband Andy

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,536
Kantar New York Studios last year and they sat down for what would become one of my

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
Favorite all-time episodes of How I built this

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632
They were

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:43,520
Both so likeable and in every way they were self-effacing and also self-deprecating

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,080
The bird kind

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Smart

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
And most importantly they were generous they were

21
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Generous with

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
The reflections and generous with the lessons they learned

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
All along the way

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
So

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,648
Is a small tribute to Kate we decided to repost this interview

26
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
To her voice and her laughter and her warm

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
And get a sense

28
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
The kind of person

29
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
She was

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
We were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were Andy was funding everything

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
I didn't leave you to shut it down I said it's

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
And in all of our savings at that point we still weren't seeing you know progression that was good

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Next year in the near future so we thought we had a good run at it we think we've had it

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
From NPR how I built this

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Show the innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements they go

36
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,400
The person behind the brand is Kate Spade

37
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Grew up as Kate Brosnahan

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
In Kansas City Missouri

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
Then she always loved fashion but

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
Never plan to work inside

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
She wanted to be a journalist

42
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
So in the early 1980s

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
She went off to study journalism

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
At Arizona State University

45
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
And that

46
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
Kate met her future husband

47
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Andy Spade

48
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
We work together at a clothing store and I was on when inside he was on the men's side and

49
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
One day his car broke down and he asked me for a ride home then we really started off

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
Really great friends the car continue to break down so relationship along

51
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
And the rest of the story well 30 plus years later they're still together

52
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Kate graduated from college first Andy was a few credits short so she decided to backpack around

53
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
Europe by yourself traveled around and came back to New York and

54
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Brentwood temp agency because I desperately needed

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
Some some money

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Arizona

57
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
To be with Andy but that's where my ticket

58
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
It started and ended in New York

59
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Got enough money to get back so I needed a job in order to do that so I started at a temp

60
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,696
Place I was typing and I said I'm I don't think this is going to work out

61
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
And then she called the next day and said

62
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,608
Can you get ready right now caught in a skulls and they have a job in fashion Department

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,472
So they ended up hiring me they didn't want to because I couldn't type

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
My boss

65
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
That wasn't she's great and I don't need her striped lot

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
If we were doing fashion shoots and styling so

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
It wasn't is what were you doing

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
Well I started as an assistant so I was

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Tying

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Model shoes

71
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
On a photoshoot because they couldn't bend over their clothes

72
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
That are getting hair stylist

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Snickers

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm telling you whatever I irons

75
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Carry bags

76
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
It was a lot of work

77
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Say that

78
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Did you were you were back

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
In Tempe at Arizona State University

80
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
I was back in Tempe I was struggling with a few required courses

81
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
I think I had more

82
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Credits the necessary but there were a few that I couldn't get through

83
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
But I did start an advertising age

84
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
And see my senior year in college

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
And so I

86
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
I started

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Trading ads for

88
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Guarding food

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Tie-dye go to a restaurant for example and I

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
I bring in the ad that they had running in the local paper

91
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
And I would show it to them and say I think I can do better if I come back and show you a

92
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
A better version of this

93
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Will you either pay me in food or give me a few hundred dollars

94
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
I had like 10 takers

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
So I ended up with 10 accounts

96
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
How many things are going well

97
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
And Kate were you still planning to head

98
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Back to Arizona

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
At that point yes

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
And I kept saying no I'm coming back

101
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
I will only stay here for

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Woofers photos

103
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Can I move to to sex

104
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
I said I have to be honest

105
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
I kind of like my job

106
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
I loved it and I love the pain of the past pay stub

107
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
New York and San Leandro

108
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
I loved it

109
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,727
Wish you got a job offer for $14,000 a year everything changed

110
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
Xi'an sting and that's what I say

111
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
I'm moving to New York

112
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
And you just figured

113
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
I'll find something

114
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
Yeah I figured I'd find something there I had a little portfolio

115
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
Of advertisements that I'd written and art directed

116
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
I thought I took that with me to New York and hopes

117
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
To finding a job

118
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
And what did you guys

119
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Did you go out like move in together

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
We did

121
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
I I forwarded a little bit of money that I had

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
Advocate for security deposit on the cheap

123
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Des Department chief

124
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Defined

125
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
And

126
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
I remember arriving in

127
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
It's a call me from a pay phone on the corner

128
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
When you arrive

129
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
And all

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Get out of the fire escape

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
So I called and I walk to 26 Renwick Street

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
And I looked up at

133
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
She was out of the fire escape she threw down a sock with a

134
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Akita

135
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,183
It's easier to go down to the walk

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
I had

137
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
One warm coat

138
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Suitcase

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
And a portfolio

140
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Wow an integer but a KTM

141
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
I know you went to an all-girls

142
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
What high school does your parents of have

143
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
The problem with you living with Andy

144
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
They never really said much but

145
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
My mother

146
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
That's not please

147
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
She was not pleased with the doll bed

148
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,783
I mean I just kept saying it was a matter of Economics just being practical

149
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
Did you actually land a job in advertising

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
I did I was interviewing and a lot of programs like y&r in Oglebay anime there

151
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,095
But my portfolio didn't reflect the kinds of accounts that they're working on cars and IBM

152
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
What is walking to Grand Central Station and a young man in a suit pulled me over I was carrying my portfolio

153
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
He said you do

154
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,615
And I said well I'm looking for a job as a copywriter he said you have a minute

155
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,015
Is it true that I'd love to look at your portfolio and we stopped in Grand Central Station he wouldn't be my portfolio and

156
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
He said I think I might have something

157
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Sing for your recruiter

158
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,231
Did you happen to see me walking to Grand Central Station

159
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,047
He went through what he said meet me in my office tomorrow

160
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
2 did any set me on three or four interviews

161
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,471
What which which was an agency named bozell Jacob Canyon and Echo

00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And

164
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
He said I know you haven't

165
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Had any experience on these

166
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Types of businesses but I like your hotspot

167
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
Oh. I didn't know what it meant until I called someone

168
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,719
What does it mean when they say I'll meet you after you took a chance starting own business at the positive

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
Until I got that job

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,423
So okay so you guys are on your early 20s

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
You're living a New York Life

172
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007

Amazon magazines

176
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Actually it was amazing

177
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
I mean it by Mom

178
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Framed

179
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
When they put my name in the

180
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Mass that she still hasn't praying

181
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
What did you start to do that

182
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
But it was first assistance

183
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
For the senior fashion editor

184
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
And

185
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Then I was promoted to associate editor

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
And I was in charge of all the accessories

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
And

188
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
I did that for a couple years and they promoted me the senior fashion editor

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
And if there's one thing I did learn was

190
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
How to be very resourceful

191
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
And it came in very handy

192
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
We started our business because

193
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
I mean

194
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
It was do not come back to me with

195
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
No

196
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
I mean you

197
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
Figure it out I mean it would be we have to go on a shoot in

198
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
2 days and we need 8 tickets

199
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Bahamas in

200
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Figure out how to get us all there

201
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
I mean if we're all on different airplanes I don't care but get us there

202
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Make it happen

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
So I guess it was

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,167
Wizard of the early 90s like maybe maybe 1991 when you decided to leave

205
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Mademoiselle magazine

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
What was going on why did you decide to go

207
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
It's funny you know Angie and I were talking one night

208
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
And I just said

209
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
I was looking ahead and

210
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
So the fashion director is

211
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
That would be your next

212
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Jump from being

213
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Senior fashion editor

214
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
And

215
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
I don't really see myself wanting that

216
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
That job

217
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
So and I were out honestly to Mexican restaurant and

218
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
He just said

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
What about a handbag

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
You just don't start a handbag company

221
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
Resupply. How hard can it be

222
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Okay really

223
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Progressives words

224
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
What white handbags

225
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
Well she was in accessories editor and she collected

226
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Your handbags for fashion shoots that was one of her key responsibilities

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
So she'd have to

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Handbags from

229
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Vintage stores

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
For Beach shoot straw bag she had a

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,231
My Personal Collection that was amazing and then she knew every handbag company in the market

232
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
And I thought you understood it better than anyone

233
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
What's missing in the market

234
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
What was missing

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
At the time things for very

236
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
Baxter too complicated

237
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
And I really love very simple kind of architectural shape

238
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
And I would wear these

239
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Very simple shapes

240
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
None of which were

241
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
Famous designers and their names

242
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Someone hurt today

243
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,623
Whose is that I'd say I don't know I bought it at a vintage store or it's a straw bag I got in Mexico

244
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Soaked and they were all very square in C

245
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Simple I thought

246
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Xiaomi why can't we find something

247
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Just clean and simple and modern

248
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Okay so about the time

249
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Vet that you want to quit you were thinking

250
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
Like I'm done with fashion magazines

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Yes

252
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
And he was like

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
You know bags you know like why don't you try to do this

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Design your own

255
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Absolutely it actually said it

256
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Flyquest I kind of

257
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
Already had in the back of my mind and

258
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
I remember the very beginnings

259
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Stay I could have

260
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
Made an income while I was working on that since someone said to me

261
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487
The truth is you would never have done it had you stayed

262
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,095
Because I would have been a scrap yours I mean that it was kind of been out do or die so

263
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
I think if I'd still been working I would have been like

264
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
A little bit more lackadaisical about it words

265
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,823
When you don't have an income, then you are doing whatever you can to make it happen

266
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
So how did you even start to

267
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Design hammock me you had no

268
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,783
Background InDesign you didn't even know what to do when like once

269
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
So things and

270
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,207
Put rivets in at all that stuff it's funny I did not know and I did start

271
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Taipei

272
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Big sheets of white

273
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Paper

274
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
And I would cut out

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Tape honestly

276
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
The shape that I wanted a knife

277
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
Look at it and make it shorter smaller cut it

278
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
And I went to a pattern maker that I found in the back of women's wear daily

279
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
She advertises she made patterns

280
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
So I contacted her she worked out of her apartments and she was

281
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Patient as could be with me

282
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
Because I didn't know anything and I remember being really embarrassed about that

283
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
That

284
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
I wasn't there

285
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Student

286
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
From Parsons to RISD or

287
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
Fit that I really didn't know what I was doing

288
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,679
And I honestly started with paper then we'd make a sample out of any kind of fabric Muslim

289
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
And then

290
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
I kind of got the shape down and I had to find a manufacturer so I called me mister daily they connected me to

291
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
Shoe department that they really said we don't do that but someone in the fashion Department said oh it's so hard I know someone

292
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
And he had left himself this

293
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
Production guide to start his own business

294
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,535
So was this guy that you found was he was he a designer manufacturer so he

295
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Did the production

296
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
And so I brought in my samples and

297
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
He was like okay why want some money up front and he really was very nervous that I wasn't going to pay him and

298
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,383
He took our tiny little production honestly which would be

299
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
10 bags of time you know

300
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
And how how long after

301
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Like you

302
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
Assertive start to sketch out designs was this was this like

303
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
A few weeks later a month later what what did you

304
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:20,511
Were you working on this idea for a long time in your apartment

305
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
At least a year and you were freelancing

306
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Knight Inn

307
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Certain days a week

308
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
As a stylist

309
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
And

310
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
After getting the

311
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Patterns made

312
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
The next

313
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
Big Challenge was finding someone who would sell us

314
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Fabric and

315
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
Because we didn't have any experience none of the fabric houses would sell us anything other than

316
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
A hundred yards for exam

317
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
Play shape so we only needed probably

318
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
40 yards

319
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
30 Yanni 25

320
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
So I called

321
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
I looked in the Yellow Pages

322
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
And I looked up

323
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Potato sack

324
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
That's

325
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Is willing to sell to

326
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Annette three different

327
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
No weights

328
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
And I needed the heaviest weight so that

329
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Substantial enough

330
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Bram.

331
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
That was actually our first collection

332
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Made out of burlap made out of burlap

333
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,927
So what is the bags look like they were imagine like brown burlap

334
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
Kind of rectangular little bag

335
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Yes absolutely with Raffia Fringe

336
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
And

337
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,423
Webbing handle and I found a wedding company also

338
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
In the Yellow Pages

339
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
I see you get this

340
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
You get these samples and then what new

341
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
How do you get

342
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
Why do you start with the first thing you do

343
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
You go to these

344
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Accessory shows

345
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Treacherous

346
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
Trade shows and you get to get accepted

347
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
And we did and

348
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
The question is

349
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
You get the worst spot because all the famous people end up in

350
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,975
Citizen in New York

351
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
This is the first

352
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
Trade show you went to debut the Kate Spade

353
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Burlap

354
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Bag yes

355
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
We honest-to-god brought in our own tables

356
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Round chairs

357
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Tiffany lamps

358
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,847
Apartment apartment are both turned into our part

359
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Basically for the week

360
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,503
What are you guys nervous I mean were you like I don't know where that what you worried that maybe somebody from

361
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Cut be a little embarrassed or

362
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
Somebody was going to call you out and say what are you doing who you guys were you where you get asked me out

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
I was I

364
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
Because the editors come by as well as the buyers

365
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
To the trade shows

366
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
And I really didn't tell my parents

367
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Or my family about it

368
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Or anyone for that matter

369
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
Because I thought if it doesn't work

370
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
I will be so

371
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Embarrassed

372
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Because everyone kept saying

373
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Why would you have quit your job

374
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
You had insurance but you know who do you think you are I just knew my family with just

375
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Oh you got a little hot-headed big headed there in New York and

376
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Think you can start this company

377
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,743
So I kept it on the down-low intentionally didn't

378
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
They talked about it much too

379
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Family

380
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
Because I think secretly both thought it would fail

381
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
How did people respond to the bag

382
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
It well

383
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,591
I remember crying because when I came home we hadn't even sold enough to cover the cost of the booth

384
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
And I started crying and Andy said both who did you get and I said

385
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
What we got

386
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Barney's

387
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
And he said

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Okay and I said

389
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Fred Segal in Los Angeles news

390
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Brahe to the news

391
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Migas

392
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Katie

393
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
To the best stores in America

394
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Why are you crying I said I think we should shut it down

395
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,655
I'm very conservative and I said I do I have no interest in losing money

396
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
I said and we feel we've already spent

397
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
$4,000 and that that's it for me I'm not a gambler

398
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
So that's fair and he was like that

399
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Keep going

400
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
And also have to get a great deal of credit

401
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
To the editor

402
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
At the time we were

403
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Selling a lot but the editors

404
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
We're putting this in the magazine

405
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,159
A lot what was it about your bags that appeal to them

406
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Attention

407
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
I did because it wasn't anything anyone was doing and everyone there's a fabric show in Paris premiere

408
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
Busy on the all the designers go to

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Sometimes you can end up with the same

410
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Material

411
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,127
Mine came out of the Yellow Pages chances are going to run into any people that have the same material

412
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,967
So we were doing something different which was really to our advantage

413
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Two editors for like

414
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
Beautiful burlap bags

415
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
They thought they were

416
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
Beautiful tiny they thought they were interested and we did we got a lot of credits than that

417
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
That's when my mother first found out

418
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,887
And she was embarrassed and she called and said that you didn't

419
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
Tell me and my friend had to tell me I said

420
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
I know I don't know I don't want to make a big deal of this and

421
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,847
It's okay it's one credit that's not a business

422
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
How did you come up

423
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
How did you start as land on the name

424
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Well that was an

425
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
Because we weren't I was not Kate Spade I was

426
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Kate Brosnahan and

427
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
I kept coming up with these names

428
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Kate

429
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
Space because we were 50-50 partners

430
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
And

431
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
Finally I just said okay and I'm inside love it

432
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Kate Spade New York and I remember telling

433
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
To your point about

434
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
My Catholic parents I told my mom

435
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Honestly she burst

436
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
In Flames she was like

437
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
But you're not keep say that I said I know but she's a

438
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,039
Oh now you'll never be Kate Spade now you've been jinxed it and why would you name it Kate Spade and I said

439
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
What's my first name his last name is like

440
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Dolce & Gabbana what the hell is that

441
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
And I said I said it'll work we hope

442
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
In just a minute

443
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
Why after three years of making no money

444
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,639
Kate and Andy almost walked away from their little handbag company

445
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
I got rides near listening to how I built this

446
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
NPR

447
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
It's how I built this from NPR

448
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Gyros

449
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,303
When Kate and Andy debut the original Kate Spade bag

450
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
They got orders from Barneys and

451
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Fred Segal

452
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
And it was a big deal in the world of fashion

453
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
Even with those orders

454
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,591
It didn't mean Kate and Andy were suddenly flush with cash or living large in New York

455
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Wasn't going to guarantee that the

456
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
Company was going to be successful in fact

457
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Andy

458
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
He kept his full-time job in advertising

459
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Beijing

460
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,927
The overhead yeah I'm basically the rent in the other expenses right we'll keep freelancing that started the company

461
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
And I just thought we were both 29 30 years old and

462
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
It's time to do it we don't have children

463
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
Let's not quit even if we

464
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Lose everything

465
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Kate can always go back to Fashion job

466
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
You know I can continue to work in advertising

467
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
And you guys are running the company

468
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Look at your apartment

469
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,735
We'd move to a loft in Tribeca because we were in a small apartment then we move to Lafayette boxes

470
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
Honestly guy everywhere

471
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
To the point where are Loft

472
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
Bad was up the stairs we crawl up

473
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
The entire apartment was just to see if

474
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
Brown boxes that sounds

475
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
We were doing very well but yeah

476
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
It really was we were still

477
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
You were shipping out

478
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Things from the apartment

479
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Oh yes for

480
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
At least

481
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Two and a half years

482
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
I know you would take the train

483
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
The Brooklyn to the factory

484
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Pick up the box

485
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,895
Just take the back on the subway

486
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
In trash bag

487
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
Walk them up a 5 floor walk-up

488
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
And she was shipping and

489
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,391
Packing bags and doing everything and taking orders on the fax machine remember they come through in the middle of the night

490
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
With your better around Wherever I Go

491
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
Excited but the orders would not be that big because it was hard to

492
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,167
The people that time to cut once they started selling then you get bigger order so it was really

493
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Very gradual I mean it was at least

494
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
3 years before we paid ourselves

495
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
Baby 15000

496
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
15000

497
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
And we're still working out of our apartment

498
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
It was our home office

499
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Please enter shipping

500
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Warehouse

501
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Andar

502
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
Did you start to see

503
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
The first year 2

504
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
Women walking around New York with

505
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
I did most of him

506
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,400
We redditors who are getting them a very good discounts

507
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,472
Eventually we started to see it and I remember thinking

508
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
What I did

509
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
That was a big deal

510
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
And

511
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,152
You know I think it took people while even my family my sister was working

512
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
At Gucci and actually

513
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,504
Called me and said we're all pitching in

514
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
Mom

515
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Father's Day

516
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
Get her Gucci bag and I thought

517
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
What

518
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
I never that

519
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Because they really didn't think

520
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
It would be much

521
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
I still should be upset with him about that hopefully they're listening

522
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,264
Show all the while you're sleeping bags out you're getting orders in and you are still designing

523
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Facts

524
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Yes

525
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
So you're working like

526
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Crazy

527
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
We are and

528
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
What we ended up doing

529
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
What speech took on

530
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Two partners

531
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
For Sweat Equity only

532
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
It was at my friend Elise Aaron's

533
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
My best friend

534
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Stars 80

535
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Teen Olympian LaBelle

536
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Someone that we just met

537
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
Two friends here in New York

538
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
So

539
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
The three of us were in cars going

540
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Factories

541
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
I was really doing the design only but

542
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Didn't I also.

543
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Steaming the bags boxing packing

544
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
And how are you guys finding all

545
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
It means it was always you

546
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah I got a job offer to work for Saatchi & Saatchi in LA and I

547
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,248
I almost tripled my salary you're still funding the company ourselves

548
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
And we needed money

549
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
For fabric and we needed money

550
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Trade shows

551
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,928
Until we both agreed that I would go to La you did move to LA

552
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
I thought I could go back and forth and at the time released

553
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Pallet wood hold down the New York

554
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Partner with you

555
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
FedEx in all my designs and materials and

556
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,008
I rented a little house that I called the house I never lived in

557
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
I never bought a piece of furniture and I just took the money and send it to me I'll put it back into the business

558
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
Did you ever get a point in the first two years

559
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Where you thought this was going to collapse if this is going to fail

560
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
Yes and I remember calling back

561
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Tulisan Pamela New York niacin

562
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
I didn't leave you two

563
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
Shut it down I said it's wow are you guys

564
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Like in dad or

565
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
It was hard I mean it was we were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were Andy was funding everything

566
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,264
And it at that point we were all kind of putting money in Pamela put into Emeli Sande

567
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
I just remember thinking of

568
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,896
We run to your 401K money

569
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
And in all of our savings at that point

570
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
We still weren't seeing

571
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,600
You know progression that was going to pass out in the next year in the near future

572
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
A good run at it

573
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
I think we called the partners who

574
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
We brought in as as

575
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,584
Equity Partners on a handshake without any salary and we said we think we've had it

576
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Exhausted and they said

577
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
Left the start with you and we haven't even had to return the deals.

578
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,944
So we felt like you can't just walk out and I remember we spoken

579
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
It said all right

580
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,296
We're going to go back

581
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
I'm trying to make

582
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
9595 96-95 probably 95 and I did get another job in

583
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
New York a great job actually

584
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
But still the company was not making money

585
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,192
What was the what what happened

586
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
I would say the stores really

587
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
Started to buy more we were in sacks

588
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
The Neiman's and

589
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
When the

590
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Large department stores started to buy

591
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
It

592
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
Kind of really took off and

593
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
We won

594
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
The cfda awards which is

595
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
The Council of fashion

596
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Designers of America

597
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
And

598
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
There were photos from around the country not just

599
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
New York at the show that were saying

600
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Who is this

601
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,376
So that really really help us a great deal I have

602
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Nosey word

603
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
If smaller designers

604
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,568
Didn't win at the time it was usually a Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein Donna

605
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Karen all this beef

606
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,944
And I remember Kate when we came back to New York and we were hoping something would happen then

607
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Either Neiman's or Saks

608
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,088
They're buying for two or three stores and they said we're going to buy for all of our stores

609
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Wow and that was 50 stores

610
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
More Than Words

611
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
And that quadruple are busy

612
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
But what you have to realize

613
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
When that happens although it's very good you also have to up

614
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Front

615
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,168
Pay for the production they don't pay you for

616
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
30 to 6

617
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Today so I remembered

618
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
Are we going to afford this but we

619
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
Never borrow a dime

620
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Ever

621
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
Was there something that you guys did like a business

622
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Decision that you

623
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
You made

624
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
That

625
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
That was the

626
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
Key to turning this around or was it just

627
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
More people started

628
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,416
Discovered in you just you just persevered through those rough years and then it's finally

629
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Just kind of on its own

630
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Youku

631
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Got discovered

632
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
That's exactly what happened I mean it really was just

633
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,888
Kind of a little bit of a Snowball Effect

634
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
No just got a little bigger and a little bit bigger and

635
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
I think

636
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
At the point where the largest department store Square picking us up

637
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
I think that it will be realized

638
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,040
Which is very important

639
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Table

640
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
And maybe you get a few

641
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
Basin shelves

642
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
Restore shop and Shop is what they call them where your name is above it really big

643
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
I got to see your

644
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
To walk into

645
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,360
I think it's more fun for my mom actually but it was a lot of fun I have to stay in the

646
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,944
Opening of stores do you know we'd open the store

647
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
And Soho tiny little 300 square-foot store the next day

648
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
You know we're opening a bigger Store New York and then we're opening in

649
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Los Angeles

650
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Austin Chicago

651
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,000
It was kind of at that point it became a little dizzy and

652
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
A bit of a whirlwind

653
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
State it was fun

654
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
Inside some point you guys sold

655
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Part of the company

656
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
That was at the service scale up or

657
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Like to make it even bigger

658
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,848
You know it was also a safety that quite honestly for us personally

659
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,200
And it wasn't even Marcus and we thought that would be somebody that would

660
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Be in a position to help us

661
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
And they bought

662
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Element more than 50

663
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Percent of companies that they bought 56

664
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,184
And reportedly for more than 30 million dollars was that

665
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Insane d.

666
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,048
That's what it was when they were I think our biggest

667
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Client restore the time and

668
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
We're doing very well with them and they just started

669
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Investing in other little

670
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Little brands that they

671
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
They thought I had potential

672
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
And yeah they came to us we were

673
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Completely

674
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
In shock

675
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Exciting because

676
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
As we thought wow

677
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Which everything goes goes away tomorrow

678
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
You know it will be able

679
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
Sustain the business

680
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
I mean it was really about not being able to have

681
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
A bit of an essay going forward

682
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
4 bus

683
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,928
I know what that mean when winning the Marcus by

684
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
More than half of the change

685
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Kate Spade

686
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
We started going into work categories because they were

687
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
Encouraging that which a lot of the stores not

688
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
Mancino's Sac all of them

689
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Really encouraging us

690
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
2

691
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
Categories

692
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
Stationary next twitch

693
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,408
That was right when the phones and emails and all that

694
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
Replacing people writing notes

695
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
Texas native Wars

696
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
Another category we didn't mean

697
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
You know I'd Online category

698
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
So I think what they were implying

699
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
Shoes they really wanted some

700
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Real substantial

701
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,792
Second categories are third fourth

702
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
So then we started doing shoes and

703
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
It really just started

704
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
No I think it was just a good boost

705
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,776
I mean you guys probably had to go from you and Andy and your two partners II

706
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
Lots of employees quickly

707
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
We did but we have done that actually

708
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
In the process

709
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Slowly slowly changing

710
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
Offices and we take a floor and then

711
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
We take another floor in the building

712
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
Who started the hiring people preparing our

713
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Different departments in production people in

714
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
And then hiring people that

715
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Have more experience

716
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
So I really had a lot of people around

717
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
And Andy did Andy really surrounded himself with the

718
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
Really

719
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Greats

720
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Art Department

721
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
And I really had great designers with me and

722
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
I think we really developed

723
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Employees that were amazing

724
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
When did you start to see

725
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Kate Spade bags

726
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
All over the

727
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Huge iconic

728
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
And when did you first kind of realized

729
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
I'd say was about

730
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
97

731
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
It was still

732
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
Ferry New York so I must say

733
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,352
There a New York Los Angeles Chicago

734
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
I think it was about 98 or 94 UTM

735
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Danny city that you went to

736
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Counterfeit started

737
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,872
That was about to

738
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
Which Andy said that's actually a compass

739
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,224
You're doing something right when

740
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,112
They're on every blanket on every street and celebrated for a day and then the next day that was over

741
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,768
You guys sold the rest of your your share of

742
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
2007

743
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
Walked away from it what why'd you decide to do that

744
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
So

745
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
We had a baby

746
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
And 2005 and I just wanted

747
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
It was a perfect opportunity

748
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
The point was it

749
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Neiman Marcus

750
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Set the time

751
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Was selling

752
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Themselves to

753
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Pacific

754
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Dan baldus

755
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
But then I must

756
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Give them a lot of credit for that

757
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,928
But when we sold everything he know

758
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Kind of like we have a

759
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
A boss

760
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
I want to leave on

761
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
On good terms if it's a

762
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Perfect time to leave

763
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
I wanted to spend time with my daughter

764
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
It was

765
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
You've heard so many horror stories

766
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,056
About people who style and then they stay and then they fighting and they sue and

767
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
That's too ugly

768
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Before me so

769
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
We left on great terms we stay because of turnover

770
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
For a year I think

771
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,600
For the transition to make sure all the employees who we loved had

772
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
Agreements to carry on

773
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
The end

774
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Making sure you understood

775
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
What the process was

776
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Instead

777
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
And

778
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
They were very gracious and I think we all handled it very well and

779
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
It was seamless

780
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
It was a very

781
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
Quiet exit

782
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,872
You guys obviously have this incredibly strong

783
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,712
Marriage meme email here college students you're still together you have a

784
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,808
You created this big amazing brand and how do you

785
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,880
How do you have a marriage and a business and

786
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
Make it work

787
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,048
Safe for my perspective I remember people saying how do you work together when I was thrilled

788
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,168
I said I'll wait up wait up and I'm not ready yet means

789
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,984
Let me tell you right now if you think that everyday

790
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,848
Good office together we can have lunch together

791
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
We actually were concept

792
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
Florist Parma that very reason because

793
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Then he'd be on the phone and I take

794
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Get off the phone

795
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
Something to tell you or ask you

796
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
And that

797
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
We had to really I had to

798
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Myself

799
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Boundaries in

800
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,536
We have to make a conscious effort not to talk about it 24/7 which is

801
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,864
As you can tell by how quickly I talk like tendency

802
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And I also am very

803
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
Nervous person I worry a lot

804
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,824
And Andy could not be more different sleepless nights person

805
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Always another

806
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
The sky is falling

807
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Zico

808
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
It's fine and I think that because we

809
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
We kind of grew up together

810
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Uniform Mart 20s

811
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Up until now in are 50

812
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,696
And we actually have a lot in common which helps

813
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
You guys

814
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
Recently

815
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
Launch a new company

816
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Together

817
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
What you call it by Frances Valentine

818
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes in case you changed your name from Kate Spade

819
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
To Kate Valentine

820
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,104
I did but I added it I didn't change it I just added

821
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Francis

822
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
Valentine into it so it's very

823
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
It's Katherine

824
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
No

825
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Francis

826
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Valentine

827
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Brosnahan Spade

828
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Elong

829
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
Did you do it in part because

830
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Kate Spade and become

831
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Its own thing and

832
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
Beyond a single person

833
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
Yes and I thought it was important to make sure that we weren't stepping on any toes and

834
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
That we distinguished

835
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
Our company

836
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
And I think that was important

837
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
For both of us

838
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,056
I mean people still call me Kate Spade I go buy it

839
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Seitz eye

840
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
I get confused

841
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
Myself so you can call me Francis if you want

842
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Tell me about Frances Valentine

843
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
We are doing

844
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
Shoes and Handbags

845
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
So we actually when we started

846
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,416
It was initially just

847
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Shoes

848
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
Although we've only

849
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Didn't visit

850
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,304
I'm not your just your little over a year

851
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
But we realize that

852
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
People expecting bad

853
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
And I mean now you're mean it sold a different right because

854
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
The hunger is

855
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
I'm sure it's still there but

856
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
It's not like a do-or-die thing

857
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
It must be that I don't know

858
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Is it less stressful

859
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,552
We've air conditioning I think that's big that's a big difference right elevators and air conditioning

860
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
I would say there's

861
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
It's

862
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
Both I feel a little more confident

863
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
I think Andy feels the same because we've done it before

864
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
But on the same hand

865
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
You think that

866
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
People are expecting a great deal

867
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
So they're still there still a lot of pressure chest mean

868
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Personal finance

869
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424

Is it sort of like barely know that that's a

879
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
It's funny because I

880
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
I do look at it and I don't

881
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,632
People said oh do you have any regrets I've ever think you all I hope I don't

882
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,984
And I never have and I think they've done such a good job that luckily I don't have to have

883
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,104
And so we do walk by the stores and I have a funny story that we actually walked into the store

884
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
To buy my daughter something

885
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,248
Went to the cash register and teeth are you on our mailing list

886
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
And I said

887
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
So

888
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
And instead that I used to

889
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Maiden name and ice

890
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
She surprised me

891
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
Send my daughter kind of kept nudging me choose died for me to say something and I didn't and then I've ever thinking you know

892
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:54,496
I'm not on your mailing list but I think I helped created

893
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,360
Kate and Andy spade and by the way if you've ever heard of Jack Spade bags for men

894
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,760
Kate and Andy were behind those two and no jack is not a real person just that cool

895
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:12,160
Cool name I mean honestly people constantly are same

896
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,024
And then I don't want to embarrass but I'll tell you he ain't heavy and then I felt

897
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:44,160
Thanks to our 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor
