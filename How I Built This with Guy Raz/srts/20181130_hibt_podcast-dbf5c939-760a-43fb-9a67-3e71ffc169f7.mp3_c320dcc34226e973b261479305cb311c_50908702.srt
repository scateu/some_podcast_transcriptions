I'll tell you candidly and I'm not proud of it

37
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
There were times when I would get my intelligence to other members of my team and have them

38
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Go in and make a presentation or them make the pitch so that the client wouldn't have to interact directly

00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Hiring employees is

55
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
One of the hardest things about running a business

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
If you listen to the show long enough you heard Founders talk about how

57
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
When their company started the

58
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Descale

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
Hiring enough good people consume so much of their time

60
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Because

61
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
Hiring requires patience in

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224

Even the best applicants sometimes

65
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
Well after they start

66
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
And this was an inside

67
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Janice Bryant howroyd

68
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
Came across early in her career after working as a secretary for

69
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
For her brother-in-law

70
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
It was the late 1970

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
And her brother-in-law

72
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
Needed an assistant for his growing role in billboard magazine

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Hollywood

74
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,032
Janice notice that lots of other Executives in Hollywood needed

75
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Clerical help too and they needed it

76
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Fast

77
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Setting up a time to find the right guy

78
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
People

79
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
So with all of her money

80
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
It was $1,500

81
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,600
Janice rented a small space in front of a rug shop in Beverly Hills

82
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
And she started an employment agency

83
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
At the time

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
Janis was a young African-American woman

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Starting out in an industry

86
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Dominated by

87
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Older white man

88
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Not today

89
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Her company

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Act-1 group does an estimated billion dollars a year in sales

91
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,336
At 1 handles hiring and recruiting for all kinds of Industries

92
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
It also provides a lot of back in service

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
Employee screening

94
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Payroll

95
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
What began

96
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
It was just

97
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
One office

98
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
One phone

99
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
And Janis

100
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Joe Pinette

101
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
First office

102
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
Listen to City she barely knew when she first arrived to LA

103
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
In her mid-20s

104
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
Janice has spent most of her life

105
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
In a very different place from Hollywood

106
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
She grew up in the 1950s and 60s

107
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Big family

108
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Small town

109
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
Carrboro North Carolina

110
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
I grew up on the other side of the tracks and that's literally the case because we did have a train that ran through

111
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
Bardstown we were a town that was

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
Incorporated in the 1700

113
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,952
So I train track in the middle of the town did indicate some level of price

114
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Spirit

115
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
Now we were segregated make no make no mistake about that

116
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
But we had that Southern etiquette

117
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703
Get that went along with it so there was a politeness

118
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
That occurred among

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
People

120
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
But we also were very aware of the injustice

121
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
How many brothers and sisters did you have growing up

122
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
By Brothers 5sis

123
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Multi phase

124
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
So 11 kids in your house

125
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,159
Yeah you say that like that sounds so much to you

126
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Yeah it does

127
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,023
She turned like a lot of kids

128
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,167
Oh my no you don't know my mom and dad if you thought there was chaos going on in the Bryant household

129
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Matter of fact we had a system we are the older siblings would take care of the younger ones and when I

130
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
I say take care I mean they were

131
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:08,223
Responsible that we did chores appropriately we had personal grooming taking care of

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
They checked us for another you helped us with

133
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,623
And that homework was Donna so Sandy got me she was first born I was

134
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Sports Bar

135
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,023
And when she went all the way off to Greensboro North Carolina which buy dry time

136
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
It's about

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
4 hours

138
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
It felt like the end of the world

139
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
At Hannaford

140
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
I ate everything just felt so empty to me yet there were still 12 people left in the house everyday if we had no

141
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Guess,

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
Did your parents I mean was there ever a sense that

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,271
You know that they were struggling or did it always feel like you had everything you needed as a kid

144
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,183
Guy I remember sitting in a class and I had what Oprah later corned aha moment

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
And I remember

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
Sitting in class and thinking wow

147
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
We are poor

148
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Had no concept

149
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
The Parvati growing up no idea

150
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,007
None at all we always had enough for us and some two

151
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
And that meant clothing fat men

152
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
Food and that also met emotional

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
When you were when you were little did you

154
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Would you dream about

155
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
What you would

156
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
B

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
When you grew up poor

158
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Did you order

159
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
Have big Ambitions as a kid or or were they kind of like biu Noel

160
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
I'll see what happen

161
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Nautzi

162
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Print media

163
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Was really the thing that

164
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Taught me so much and books

165
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Sprint.

166
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
My mom bought encyclopedias and then she

167
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
He paid them off

168
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Overtime

169
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
She also have periodic

170
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
That came to our house

171
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
There was a magazine called sip

172
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
There was ebony was popular

173
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Jet Magazine was popular back

174
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
And so

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
I knew a lot about

176
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
The world and I knew a lot about

177
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
What black

178
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
People were doing in so I had role models who

179
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Applefield

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
Thoughts about what I might do when I grew up

181
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,447
But as a very young child I remember admiring my mom so much I can change it to do to this

182
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Date

183
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
She even then I could sense even though I

184
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Could you put label to it

185
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
Was quite an efficient person and she ran our home like a

186
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
A business

187
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
My dad was a foreman

188
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
He was a poor man in a diaper

189
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
You know we're textile community in North Carolina

190
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
And dad was

191
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Very integrated in our lives

192
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,887
EBay sure that we had on Thursday founded meetings Thursday was payday

193
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
And we all had to

194
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
To gather around and we discussed what we done what we would be doing

195
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
In business we say we discussed the gaps

196
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
And we brought war with the Solutions in my family dad just said let's see where we are and where we're going kids

197
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
That was always his open comment

198
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
Genesis when you were when you were a girl when your kid

199
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,975
Did you see entrepreneurs around you either in your community or or in your family

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
Retrospectively I saw them growing up I did not know that's what I was

201
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Was looking at

202
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,495
I remember Grandma Dora walking around topper in high heel shoes coming over to our house

203
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
And they ran a Barbie

204
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Accushot

205
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
And

206
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
They had a home that

207
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
Had a beautiful dining room in it

208
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,295
But their dining room was to serve their customers

209
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
Yeah and white people would come over to eat beer

210
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Which was a big

211
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,255
Deal that they were coming over to have dinner with your lunch

212
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
But I didn't look at that is on

213
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
Then that's just what grandma did you know

214
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
I also saw her run

215
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
She said people to go bag

216
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
Common buy beer lunches or dinners at the back and she would charge based on who was working and who

217
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Who was out of work

218
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,063
And she had that sense of justice in her mind about how to run her business and

219
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
I think it paid off because she did quite well

220
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Such as I read that

221
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
When you are in high school

222
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
Your Mom and Dad decided to send you to a

223
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
And all white ice

224
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
You were going to be there

225
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
First

226
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
African-American students

227
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
At that school

228
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
What do you remember about

229
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
But your first day going in there

230
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Well

231
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Mom and dad

232
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Didn't send me

233
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
We decided as a family

234
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Event that would happen our community

235
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
She wanted to have our best and brightest

236
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Go to the white school

237
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
To lessen any

238
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Beer around with her and not the school with

239
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Dilapidated anyway paillard

240
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Attending it

241
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
And I was one of the first

242
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,191
And I remember my first day going into my English class

243
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
And I thought oh

244
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:51,871
English has always been one of my better subjects and I'm going to fail because I couldn't understand my English

245
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
She had a twang that

246
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Sounded so

247
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
Different tubing from my side of Tarboro

248
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
Mind you were talking about a distance that I could

249
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Walk to school from my home

250
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
But she sounded so

251
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Different

252
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
The communities were truly divided in that way

253
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Yeah

254
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
And

255
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,495
We had a teacher who stood up on the desk that day the first day I went into his history class

256
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
And explain so

257
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Eloquently if you can even

258
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
See the paradox

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Said that how

260
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
Blacks are so suited to slavery

261
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
Are never chilling so

262
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Hard

263
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
God please don't let me cry

264
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
If you just let me get out of here without crying

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
I'll never come

266
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
That's how intimidated how fearful and how far am I

267
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Felt in a US history

268
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,983
Did you want to stop going to that school I mean like to imagine being 16 year old

269
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
1516 old kitten

270
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,127
And feeling that level of hostility and then searing a teacher

271
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Say that

272
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Somebody with power

273
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Just to say that

274
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
I absolutely do you want to stop going and I told my dad I didn't want to go back and dad gave me three options

275
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
He said

276
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
You can

277
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Come back here and compete against

278
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Other

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Black kids who are going to need scholarships to go to school

280
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
He could go up and he could

281
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Florida teacher

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
And seek retaliation

283
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
Or I could go back and I could understand and this is something that if you say too many black people they were

284
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Finish this sentence

285
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
For you it's not what they call you

286
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
It's what you answer to

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
And that was my

288
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
First big lesson

289
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
From Dad

290
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
That I should not listen to what they called me

291
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
I could only be what I answer

292
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Cu

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Graduate high school

294
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
And then you went off

295
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Unity College

296
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
North Carolina

297
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
A&T

298
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
Remember about that time

299
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
I'd love that

300
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
At campus and that's where my older sister

301
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
It was such a

302
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Wonderful time to

303
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
To be at North Carolina

304
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Everybody was

305
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Full of promising

306
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Ideas about what we

307
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
It 2

308
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
So much of my

309
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Adult framing happened on that

310
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
That campus in

311
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
By the time I started my own business

312
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,143
I was able to reach back

313
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,263
On what I had learned in my home which is where I gave most of my business education

314
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Set my home

315
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
And

316
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
The ability

317
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
T2

318
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
To meet new people and not a stranger

319
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
That I learned at 8

320
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Tea that was sold

321
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Wonderful

322
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Yeah

323
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
What did you do

324
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
When you graduate

325
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
First I worked

326
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
In the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC

327
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
DC

328
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,583
I worked here for about a year-and-a-half and I went home to visit

329
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Mom and

330
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Dad

331
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
And

332
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
I

333
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Remember

334
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
One morning

335
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
My mom and dad

336
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,431
When we were kids early morning was always there time I told you that left her work really early

337
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
In the morning sun

338
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Good date time

339
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
What's early morning

340
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,135
And they dated in the kitchen in the little bay window where she has a table there

341
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
To this day

342
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
And I got up to walk through the hall

343
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,607
And I saw them kissing and hugging just just like teenagers and I thought

344
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
You know I'm an adult by that right

345
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,495
That was the last time my mom saw my dad alive

346
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
And I

347
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Many times since then

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Have thought

349
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
If you have to say goodbye

350
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
What a wonderful way for her to know

351
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
That the last time you saw her alive

352
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
He held her in

353
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,183
After so richly and she him

354
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Heart attack

355
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
My dad had taken too young man out

356
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Auntie

357
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Waters in North Carolina

358
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Shrimp Boat Fishing

359
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
They want a shrimp boat

360
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
And a storm came up

361
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
My cat was taken in the storm

362
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
And so

363
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
I remember my mom took to her bed for a couple of weeks

364
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
I had booked

365
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Ticket to come to

366
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
California to visit my sister Sandy

367
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
And

368
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
I remember I told my mom I'll stay here with you Mom

369
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,095
And help you my mom it been married since she was a teenager she's never had any other boys

370
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Brandon

371
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
I knew there would be some heavy adjustment

372
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
And

373
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
She said

374
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
No

375
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm going to have to learn to live on my own I better do it now

376
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
And then

377
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,711
She said the last thing dad would want

378
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783

When he came back I have reorganized things put things in form as I saw they should

460
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,759
B and he thought I at work magic I thought I did what I was supposed

461
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
52 and he said you know you don't you you really are good Janice you should not go back

462
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
Without proving you can make it on your own and

463
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,375
He was the one who seated the idea that I should hang my own shingle you are looking for work

464
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
And your brother-in-law

465
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Essentially says

466
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Hey Janice why don't you just

467
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007

468
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,591
And you've got your job you got your own job

469
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,663
He absolutely did it was that simple

470
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,039

472
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
That I wasn't seeing in myself

473
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
So what was the business idea that

474
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
You guys started to talk about

475
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
I actually started as a full-time aide

476
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Wit meaning what

477
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,655
We were finding I found people full-time jobs

478
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
You were like a headhunter

479
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Yeah

480
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
At the admin

481
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
So what

482
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Once you decided

483
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
That you were going to start

484
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
This company's agency to help

485
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Place people in Ninjago

486
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,039
What was the first movie where did you get a novice how did you

487
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
How did you start it

488
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
I made a deal with a guy who owns the rug

489
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Book Shop in

490
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
My setup office in

491
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Front of the rug shop

492
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
Where was the Revenant filmed

493
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
Beautiful in Beverly Hills

494
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
In Beverly Hills location location location wanted a Beverly Hills address to say

495
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
I had a friend who

496
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
Hook me up with someone who had a Beverly Hills location

497
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
I was not looking at real estate that way

498
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
But it worked out

499
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Perfect

500
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Stars were lying

501
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
And what did you call it what you call the company

502
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Act 1

503
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
As in act 1

504
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
When you're in a movie that kind of act 1

505
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:46,559
You know because it's located here in Los Angeles are yet many people thought that but

506
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
But for me it was

507
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
What's more around the biblical

508
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Ants the book of Acts

509
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,823
So you get get this lot of space and what you put in a desk and a phone and

510
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,663
And there didn't have to it was there

511
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,247
And it worked out very well for me but I'll tell you something when I

512
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
I did get my own office but I remember the first

513
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Date

514
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
I got a

515
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Fax machine

516
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,183
Do you know who Judy Jetson Ensure

517
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
Of course I thought I was

518
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Judy Jetson

519
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Knology hit

520
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Hard for me

521
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
Yes that was incredible for me

522
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
And it also taught me the power of

523
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Of Technology

524
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
And I think that's why

525
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Over the years my company has he

526
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
Baltimore Around how we build

527
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Human friendly technology

528
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Then anything else

529
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
When you

530
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Started at 1

531
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Did you need a lot of

532
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
A lot of startup money to get it going

533
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Borrowed money from my

534
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Mom and I had

535
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Save 900 in Paris 600 from

536
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
But see you at $1,500 to start this business

537
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
Yep and that was going to get you the office

538
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Sally's on the office

539
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
And I guess a phone

540
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
But here so I'm trying to understand you're so young and

541
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
You just

542
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
Reception just got there

543
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
So how did you even start how did you even find people

544
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
2

545
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
To recruit

546
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
To say hey you know what you looking for work I can help you

547
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,720
About finding people to place was not an issue during that time

548
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Finding the jobs was

549
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
And the

550
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
Core of our business remains today as it was when I was one desk and that's understanding the power of the in

551
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Understand I mean you

552
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,128
Talked with me for a few minutes now you know a lot about me and you know a lot of resource

553
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Message to go to gain more information

554
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
And that's the way the interview work

555
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
Is well so the power of that interview enabled me to make sure that I understood the individual who was looking for work

556
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
I knew where they'd already worked

557
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,536
I knew if they were already employed that once they left there was going to be an opening fear

558
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
And because of the rich Network that I was able to achieve in the social side of how I lived with my

559
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
My brother and sister

560
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
I knew people who were looking for assist

561
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Does people who are looking for people

562
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Ulta hire

563
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
And built it on that

564
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
In the early days

565
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,736
I call it the womb word-of-mouth baby

566
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
I got

567
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
I got most of my league

568
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:21,440
To work opportunities to fill positions and most of the least or applicants

569
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
By Word of Mouth

570
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
So your business model was

571
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
You help companies

572
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Fill these jobs

573
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,144
Mostly clerical jobs and

574
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
They would pay you a fee

575
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
And how are you able to guarantee that

576
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
The person you are offering was

577
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Going to workout

578
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Oh my goodness

579
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,224
Is there were so many different guarantees that were offered in her industry back then I have thought about this for years

580
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,064
But that's the risk you take on making sure that you're making a good place

581
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,392
And that's why I say we had to focus on the applicant

582
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Because you

583
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,256
You offered people money back if they didn't work out

584
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Then you know

585
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
You had

586
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,168
You had a reduction in that feed you got and you got you have to pay that money back if they didn't laugh

587
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Nobody wanted to do that

588
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Were you

589
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Profitable

590
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
Pretty quickly or did it take some time

591
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Actually

592
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Thinking back on it

593
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
Hitting profitability in a year

594
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Sings

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,672
Pretty good but living through it it didn't

596
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
But remember

597
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
I was in a

598
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
Very low overhead based

599
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
And I was in a business fat cat

600
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Hi Transit

601
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
I was just

602
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
Good as my effort

603
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Allow meat

604
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Yeah

605
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
Early days as you do as you start to grow

606
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Things rooting for like kind of

607
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
In the midst of this you like

608
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
You got married to write like in the early eighties

609
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,856
Well I met my husband as an industry conference

610
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
Bernie

611
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,464
I saw this guy and he was really handsome to me

612
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
He had this presence about himself

613
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,328
And he also spoke with this

614
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
English accent

615
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
But he liked me a lot more than I did

616
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
I noticed him I can't say I didn't notice

617
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
But he liked me a lot more than I like

618
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Liked him and he

619
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
He chased me for a bit

620
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
And

621
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
I found out that

622
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
He was the founder

623
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
An apple one was a

624
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,344
Temporary employment agencies with apple one was Apple One was a

625
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
Really respected temporary employee and full-time placement agency

626
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
I doing business in California

627
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
So you married a sense of your competitor how did you keep

628
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
Like work and personal life separate

629
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,752
My husband and I love each other very much so definitely we

630
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
Have Rich and open cover

631
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,128
Versation so I think it would be the same as if we've had been

632
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Positions

633
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,808
We are going to share a love of the industry and talk about it

634
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
And we're still competent capable people building a business

635
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,696
My husband is a white

636
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
European born man and

637
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
I have had a

638
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Sissy's we are there have been differences in social settings not ever in business where people of old

639
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,800
You might you're so lucky you were married to him you must have learned so much from him

640
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
But

641
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
At the end of the

642
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Today I think

643
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Bernie and his

644
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Best honest

645
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:27,040
Our conversation will tell you that he has rather learned a lot from me

646
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
And so when was it clear to you that

647
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
This wasn't just going to

648
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Become sustainable but this could actually become

649
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
Billy Pig business was it

650
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Was it

651
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Within a year was it within 2 years

652
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Was it

653
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
After that

654
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
No no no I would say it was about

655
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,288
I want to say six or seven years in

656
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
And I remember a lady named

657
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Gwen Moore Gwen Moore

658
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
An elected

659
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
The facial congresswoman

660
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Out of

661
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
California

662
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
And she had

663
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
Been very active in

664
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,440
Championing and I believe she was one of the original authors

665
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
Of legislation that

666
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Required public utility

667
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Tea companies in California

668
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
To have diversity spin

669
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Because she said you're ratepayers

670
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Adverse

671
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
So you should be doing business with them

672
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
And she contact

673
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
I still want to come see you

674
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
And she met with me

675
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,456
And she told me that I had an obligation to get certified

676
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
To do what

677
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
As a minority

678
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Woman-owned company

679
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
And I didn't want to do

680
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Do that I was doing very well thank you

681
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
And she said no it's not about you doing better

682
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
Although you will

683
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,888
She said it's about you creating the opportunity for other

684
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
Who won't get a shot

685
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
She said we need some

686
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
Strong businesses that are run by women

687
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
And run by minority

688
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
To certify

689
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,992
And go in and do business as such to open the door for others

690
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,088
And even when she was arguing the point as eloquent as

691
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
Clear as she is

692
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
I wasn't getting the

693
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Bullet because

694
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
Initially I thought that certification

695
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Was a strip search

696
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,936
I need it to open up my business to Total exposure to someone

697
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,056
2 in return have them come back and say yes you are a minority

698
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,128
Yes you are a woman and yes you are running this

699
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
And it just did not align with how I felt that I wanted to

700
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Be measured

701
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,440
Becoming certified opened up many new client opportunities

752
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
He's for me because

753
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,328
Now companies could look at me as it look at my business as an offer

754
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
Opportunity to meet numbers and quotas that they had a round inclusion diverse

755
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
City and inclusion

756
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:08,384
And if it became a choice between me and another company who is not certified

757
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
I was going to get that off

758
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Opportunity

759
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
I never known that existed

760
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
Before I get certified

761
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
And so that's when I started to expand into

762
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
Contract business before then

763
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,208
I was doing business on handshake Sauron

764
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:27,072
Service agreement but once I started to go after different types of business

765
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,400
I needed to do it in contracts and had to learn a lot about

766
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Process

767
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,032
And one of the failures I've seen occur in my own business as in others

768
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
Is that we create

769
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,664
Great relationships with people and companies and definitely we should do that

770
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
But people are moving all of the

771
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,272
The time and the agreement you have with a person

772
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
It may not aligned

773
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,672
With the agreement you have in that contract and when that person is gone that contract is still

774
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Spending

775
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
I saw you got to understand the difference

776
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
Between that and that was one of the biggest lessons I had

777
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
To learn

778
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Once I started to expand my business

779
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
From focusing on

780
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
One-on-one transactions into

781
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Contract

782
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,592
I just keep thinking and it seems like you were growing

783
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Pretty fast

784
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Your head has been spinning

785
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
Well let me tell you two things about that

786
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
One the

787
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Big

788
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,320
Sing for me was not so much the X

789
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
Exponential growth as it was

790
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,440
The adoption of doing the

791
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Temp work

792
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
And bringing temp into the fold

793
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Temp work

794
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
You're paying people longer for the

795
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Hyatt Peju

796
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,168
And so there is another element of

797
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Riskin

798
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
You're also the employer of that

799
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Worker

800
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
And so you assumed

801
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
The employer

802
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
So you got

803
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
To Dynamic new

804
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
And very strong

805
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
Difference

806
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Our Inn place

807
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,832
And you're competing against larger entities

808
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,160
Who are going in and Abel because of their scale

809
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
To offer a much

810
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Better pricing

811
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
And

812
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
You are

813
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,144
Part for me and many companies like me woman-owned you were the minority company are you with Adam

814
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,472
Diverse company so you were getting one tip of that business

815
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Against

816
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
1 larger than dirt

817
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
And I still had to meet the same pricing

818
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
As a larger cup

819
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
To do that efficiently

820
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Need to do that sustainably

821
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
I need it to integrate

822
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
Biology in a different way and I didn't find any over

823
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Shell technology

824
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,952
So that's when I started to hire people and we built our own technology

825
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:35,072
I guess we just mentioned here Jenna said that some of the solutions that you came up with

826
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Charlie Davies

827
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Became

828
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Issued part of your business

829
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
Yashow our technology sweet is called deceleration

830
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:49,408
And it really was about that details reporting we were able to give to clients that they weren't getting any

831
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Anywhere else

832
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
And so

833
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
I had a client up north who had a

834
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Very bad experience with a publicly held

835
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Company

836
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
Call me on a Friday morning

837
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
And asked if I would come up

838
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
So I actually ran over to

839
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
The airport with my brother

840
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Another employee

841
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,840
And the three of us went up North

842
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
Add Northern California to

843
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
To the client

844
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
And we found out that they had an issue where this publicly held company was not negotiating well with them

845
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Walked out

846
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
And they had several hundred temps who had to be paid

847
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
And we had to get all of that work together

848
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
Transition those people

849
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,904
And on Monday morning all of the work was done everyone was paid and they have reports on their desk

850
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,512
I got a call from the lady who was head of HR and sit my goodness Janice

851
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
How are you able to do this

852
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,960
And I explained that we used for her but we use in our own company technologies that enable us to do that

853
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
As she said we've been working with this company for 12 years

854
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,640
And they've never been able to give us a detailed of reporting that you have here

855
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
And they started to what

856
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
Conversations around how to buy my ticket

857
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Pieology

858
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
And my brother called and said Janice

859
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Best pause

860
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
Don't sell them to technology

861
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
She sell them for service

862
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
I said called him but he said no

863
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
Don't sell your technology

864
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,680
To them sell them the server

865
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
And we went up and had a

866
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Conversation with

867
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,080
With them and they became out first acceleration custom

868
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,504
You miss your brother several members of your family actually work for

869
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
For the company for act 1

870
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Absolutely

871
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
My sister Sandy was my first employee

872
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
And since then I went on to hire

873
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
7-Up a sibling sent to my

874
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,400
And they have just been incredible for all of those emotional and those are values

875
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
Support systems that you need in place

876
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:53,568
As you're growing a business up everyone needs that I needed that and I had that in Sibley

877
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,664
Now one of the things that I insisted for my family members

878
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,528
Before they could come into my company is that they either had to work for 3 years

879
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
In a larger company somewhere else

880
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
Or have three promotion

881
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Before they could come to work for me

882
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,768
I wanted to make sure that they brought into my business some learning

883
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Not just the ability

884
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
To sustain for

885
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
But the ability

886
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Teach you how to learn and have

887
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
Grown within someone else's organ

888
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
The station

889
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
And then bring that value into mine

890
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,896
I guess at a certain point this is like 2007/2008

891
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Your business

892
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,504
Worth well over half a billion dollars by that

893
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,320
And you decide to merge

894
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
With Bernard's business with your husband's business

895
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
Tell me why why did that happen dissenters was a Justice or the natural pointed going to bring your businesses together

896
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
When Bernie and I

897
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
We're leaving a conference

898
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
In San Diego

899
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
We

900
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,592
Decided to take the scenic route

901
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Back to

902
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
La

903
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
And we were having a discussion about our

904
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
And

905
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
I remember

906
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
My brother has said

907
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
To be cross

908
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Had said

909
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
You know Janice

910
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Ewan Birney

911
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,768
Have something that nobody else in this industry has

912
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
And I asked him what he meant

913
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,656
He said will you guys work from completely different sets of

914
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
Strengths oftentimes

915
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
And if you were to combine that that could be

916
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Dynamic in the industry

917
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
And I thought that was nice and I mentioned it to

918
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
To Boerne

919
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
And Bernie said that makes sense I said but it's not enough to to to merge our companies and we talked more

920
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,368
Or and then I said you know Bernie

921
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
I think the thing that would make it interesting

922
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Kunming

923
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:51,840
Is that our son not have to decide which one of us he wants to work for

924
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
Because by then our son was looking at

925
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,008
Our industry as a future for himself

926
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,664
And he had worked in my company had worked in his dad's company as a kid

927
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,736
And I said Bernie I don't think he should have to make

928
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
The choice

929
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,600
And it is a lot better succession planning

930
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
For us to go ahead and do this now let's not have him have

931
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Do it later

932
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
And that was the decision that was

933
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
Bought around how we will blend the companies

934
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Just wondering

935
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
You're looking back

936
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,080
As a crew member for a long time you were

937
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
A minority within a minority you your small company

938
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Be competitors

939
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,528
Your woman of color in an industry that was

940
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
I'm assuming dominated by

941
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
By white man

942
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,440
Did you run into circumstances a lot of circumstances where you

943
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
You are judged because of

944
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,024
Who you are or

945
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
Or where things were made

946
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
Much harder because of who you are

947
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Very often

948
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,728
Very often I ran into that

949
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,800
I'll tell you candidly and I'm not proud of it

950
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
There were times when I would

951
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Gift my intelligence 2

952
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,528
Other members of my team and have them go in and make a presentation or them make the pitch

953
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
So that the client wouldn't have to end interact directly with me as an African-American or as of

954
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Female

955
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Because you thought

956
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
They wouldn't want to

957
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,632
In some instances I thought it in other instances I knew it

958
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Didn't they saw

959
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
An African American woman

960
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Making the pitch

961
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
They

962
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
They wouldn't want to work with you

963
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
I think the

964
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Questioning and the

965
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Scrutiny would be different

966
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
There would be more

967
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Question of

968
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
Can we then how will

969
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Right

970
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Whereas if I spent

971
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Someone different on my

972
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
18

973
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
Tok questions around how are we going to do

974
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
This happened a lot quicker in the conversation

975
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
Are there women who will tell you to

976
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
They that still

977
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
How

978
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,520
How have you served grown as a leader

979
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,848
Over that time I mean for the things that you did

980
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Earlier on that

981
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,688
Or mistakes that you learn from and you thought well

982
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
But that was not the way to go

983
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
Certainly I've made me

984
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,136
Estates the bigger of my mistakes

985
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
We're the mistakes I made we are

986
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,560
I have held myself back because of things that were

987
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,888
Latent from my childhood and sometimes burn

988
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:40,800
You know in businesses around the ism sweater that be racism or sexism or whatever

989
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,384
But those have been where I think my bigger errors have been made

990
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
When you use a when you held yourself back by

991
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,552
For example by not taking those meetings or by sending somebody else in here

992
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
Your place what what other

993
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
What are the ways to

994
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Did you hold yourself back

995
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Holding myself back from

996
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
Taking risk

997
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
Around expanding or investment

998
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Bat

999
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
Work

1000
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
Right in the core of what I'm doing

1001
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
But I always

1002
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
I always saw myself as

1003
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
You know driving in my lane and under

1004
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
The standing where my Lane

1005
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Dell

1006
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Sounds like

1007
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,760
Even though you have has Incredibles

1008
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Success you

1009
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
By Nature you're not

1010
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,112
I serve a Kamikaze risked

1011
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
Well I'm not going to be the bull in the china shop

1012
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
If that's what you're saying

1013
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,376
I'm not going to rush through and you know break things on the way to a higher goal

1014
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,728
Perhaps the one decision I would change if

1015
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
In my career

1016
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:49,920
Would be that I would forgive myself for being smart and being female a lot sooner

1017
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
Everything else I think

1018
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Has been

1019
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,344
Integrated toward the good of a solid business that has a stye

1020
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Strong suit

1021
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
Today at 1

1022
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Is

1023
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
Either the largest or simile

1024
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
One of the largest privately held

1025
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
Women and minority-owned

1026
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,704
Workforce management companies in the US your you and your family

1027
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,776
On this company I believe 100% that right

1028
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
Is a billion dollar business

1029
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
I mean that

1030
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
That's amazing

1031
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
It's

1032
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
Which think about that for a moment you came to LA

1033
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Break 2 or 3 weeks

1034
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Trip

1035
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
And building

1036
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
Billion dollar business

1037
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
It's a blessing

1038
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
This is what we feel

1039
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
This is what

1040
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,048
All of the people who really believed in me and trusted in me

1041
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,680
Have built-in in our company we teach that there five things you can't teach people

1042
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
You can't teach people experience

1043
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
You can't teach

1044
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
People

1045
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Common sense

1046
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
You can't teach

1047
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Rich people confidence

1048
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:01,087
You cannot teach people anything if they don't want to learn it and you can't teach him anything

1049
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
If they know it all

1050
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
And I think when I look at

1051
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,767
Where you see the amazement and building a billion-dollar

1052
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Enterprise

1053
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,375
I think it's because those things that you can't teach

1054
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
I've learned

1055
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
How much of

1056
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
All that you've achieved to you

1057
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
Sink is because of

1058
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
The hard work you put in and

1059
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,455
Your determination and your skill and and how much

1060
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Just because

1061
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Unlock

1062
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,855
I don't think luck had anything to do

1063
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
I do believe that I've been blessed

1064
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
And I have

1065
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,047
Receive those Blessings by honoring them with

1066
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
All of the challenges

1067
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
All of the

1068
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
People

1069
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
All of the clients and applicants

1070
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
My life has been a colitis

1071
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Copic opportunity

1072
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
I keep going back to that moment where your

1073
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Your mom

1074
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
Good morning told you to leave

1075
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Told you to go

1076
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
She did

1077
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
But your dad would want you to

1078
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
2

1079
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
To pursue whatever it was

1080
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
So you were going to pursue

1081
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
And you didn't

1082
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
Know what that was going to be

1083
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Right I mean

1084
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Imagine with your dad

1085
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
Would make us dislike

1086
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
His daughter

1087
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,543
Running the largest

1088
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Women and minority-owned

1089
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Business

1090
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
This kind in the world I mean

1091
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
He would say or think

1092
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,367
I absolutely can't imagine what Dad would say or what that would think

1093
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
My dad is the one who

1094
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
Who told us it was our attitude not aptitude

1095
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,815
My dad was the one who told us education is freedom

1096
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,679
My dad was the one who taught us that we wake up on purpose you know

1097
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
Nnnn

1098
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,287
I think about him so often

1099
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,127
And you can't not think about him when you're with Mom

1100
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
I was

1101
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,223
Voted princess in high school

1102
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
And I remember asking for new gown to wear on a float and dad said oh we can't afford it weave

1103
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
You work so hard for you guys

1104
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,303
And I remember my mom putting her hand on my DS Hannah said no Daddy they called each other mommy and daddy

1105
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
She said no Daddy

1106
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
Don't tell Janice we work hard for our kids

1107
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,239
We work hard because of the decisions we made

1108
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,127
And I kept that in my mind as I built my business and I've made

1109
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
A point never to tell my children I don't work hard to give them what they want I work hard because of the

1110
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Decision I've made

1111
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
You know

1112
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
And for me

1113
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
It's a choice

1114
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
What's a joy to do

1115
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Baidu

1116
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
That's Janice Bryant howroyd

1117
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
Founder and CEO of

1118
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,351
Act-1 group

1119
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:57,471
Apis that you open in Beverly Hills with just 1,500 bucks

1120
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,311
Now has an estimated net worth of 300

1121
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
50 million dollars and she's also donated some of that money to education 10000000 to supports

1122
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,039
Scholarships at USC and her adopted City of La

1123
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,135
And another 10 million set aside for her much-loved alma mater

1124
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
North Carolina A&T

1125
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
And please do stick around because in just a moment

1126
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,943
We're going to hear from you about the things

1127
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
North building

1128
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
The first a quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

1129
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,135
Do want you to know that the newest member of the Microsoft Surface family

1130
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
Surface Pro 6

1131
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
As if

1132
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,743
13 1/2 hours of battery life

1133
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
8th gen Intel Core processor

1134
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
You can work for as long as you want to

1135
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Wherever work takes you

1136
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Hey thanks so much

1137
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Sticking around because it's

1138
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,567
Time now for how you built that

1139
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,407
What's set the scene here it's 2013

1140
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
Overwhelming and his wife Helene ER living in

1141
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Phoenix

1142
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
And the feeling a little Restless

1143
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,367
I think we dearly wanted

1144
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
To do something different

1145
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
But we will also

1146
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Completely broke

1147
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:28,607
But they did have one daughter in college

1148
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,679
They lost a ton of money in the housing crash

1149
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,007
So it was not a good situation

1150
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
They decided

1151
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Come up with a plan

1152
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
And I said to myself

1153
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Find something that we love to do

1154
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,527
And maybe we can sell to people and we almost have to do it anything they wound up doing

1155
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,623
Yeah she grew out of offers love for music he would come home at night

1156
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
And doodle on his acoustic

1157
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
Guitar but as he was doing this

1158
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,279
You thinking this is fine but

1159
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
This experience

1160
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
It could be a lot

1161
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,751
Better yeah I want to have with the electric guitars Cup players have you know they get all the toys

1162
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,823
Is on the gadget that can attach any sound that they want

1163
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,407
Sikkens paint their music and anyway they want

1164
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Overthinking

1165
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:19,807
I want to do that too I want to make my acoustic guitar sound more Dynamic more

1166
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Electric

1167
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,903
But I want to do it in a really simple way

1168
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,999
With no bulky amplifiers nothing to plug into a wall

1169
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
So

1170
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
He comes up with an idea

1171
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,839
For a little box

1172
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,191
Try to imagine dizzy it's the size of a big iPhone

1173
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,519
Chilling imagine that you take this thing and you attach it to the

1174
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Back of your guitar

1175
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
And then you give it some battery power

1176
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
Building Electronics

1177
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,551
Nintendo anything that you need to do is push one button and you start playing

1178
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,183
Insanity from the body of the guitar you don't heal

1179
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
Only you'll get down but you also hearing

1180
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Different kind of

1181
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:06,911
To fix okay this is not much of a spoiler but this is a spoiler alert we are obviously listening to overs and

1182
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Mention as I speak

1183
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
It's called the tonewood amp

1184
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,823
That's pretty much how we envisioned it it's a battery powered box that

1185
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,871
Attaches to the back of your couch

1186
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Guitar

1187
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:21,247
And in the Box are a bunch of electronics that can make all kinds of

1188
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Cool effects

1189
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,647
Reverb delay tremolo Overdrive

1190
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
You can

1191
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,255
Feel that you are inside Carnegie Hall

1192
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,351
It's like if I couldn't seeing suddenly I could sing

1193
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,727
And it sounds pretty impressive now but

1194
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Too ahead of ourselves

1195
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
I mean the tonewood amp Injustice

1196
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
Fall out of the sky fully-formed

1197
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,759
Back in 2013 / was working on the very first prototype in his kitchen

1198
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
Fellaini

1199
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,255
What is he up to

1200
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
In this case it was actually believe it or not the sponge that I went to Hobby Lobby and I bought

1201
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:17,055
And it was electrician tape that's how held everything together and some electronic devices that I had to talk

1202
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
Home that they basically put together

1203
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,895
And gather first prototype was

1204
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
Scott Janke looking

1205
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,527
But over eventually got together with an electronic engineer to make the next

1206
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Version

1207
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
By the summer of 2014

1208
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
They were ready to show it off at a trade show in Nashville and the first really impressive musician that

1209
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
At waughtown

1210
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:42,143
Lean was Larry Mitchell who was the Grammy winner and I went up to my so would you like to

1211
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
Try the tonewood amp

1212
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,567
And he went with over to the whisperroom and when he came out he said to other musicians I don't even know how to

1213
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Planet you just

1214
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Goddess

1215
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
Go try it

1216
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
And that

1217
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,223
Basically became heleni andover's marketing strategy

1218
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
Did ask all these well-known musicians

1219
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
The try the tonewood amp

1220
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,135
And then get them to make videos of themselves

1221
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,743
You know we're here in Phoenix Arizona and George Benson I heard about us

1222
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:15,423
And then many artists introduced to artists like Travis toy from the Rascal Flatts

1223
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
Peking and we went to her home

1224
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,455
Janis Ian Joe Bonamassa

1225
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Vince Gill

1226
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
The word kept on spreading and spreading in

1227
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
You've got

1228
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Folks using it all over the world

1229
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
And Laney and overtook

1230
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Some of these videos

1231
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,999
Switch and use them to launch a Kickstarter campaign

1232
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
They raised $120,000 enough to get

1233
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,655
Two factories in Phoenix to start making the device

1234
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,471
That was just four years ago and today

1235
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
They sold close to

1236
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,383
30000 units and they expect to gross more than $2000000 this year alone

1237
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Which means

1238
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
They're no longer feeling as pinched for cash

1239
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
As they were when they started

1240
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,599
Moving from really being on the brink of being broke

1241
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,183
To profitable that was a real blessing for us

1242
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,719
And when your

1243
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:17,119
Midlife and you don't really have savings and you don't really like what you're doing

1244
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
You become

1245
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
More hungry

1246
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
So

1247
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,775
This was like a really important

1248
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
