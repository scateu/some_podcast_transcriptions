We had a great artist

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:22,528
And he did a woodcut portrait of Bert and we started putting that on the package

10
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
A very conscious decision to use Burt's face he have a long grey beard and long grey crew

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Curly hair in a bun as a woman who could never measure up to this

Glamorous image in mainstream cosmetics and beauty products you know I felt like where

One of the biggest natural Personal Care brands

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
In America

21
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
Every Sunday at my local farmer's market

22
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
There are people who sell homemade hot sauce and

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
Handcrafted wallets

24
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904

Seimei

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Back in the mid-1980s

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
And if you happen to be near Bangor

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
You might have come across Roxanne Quimby and

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,080
Burt shavitz selling jars of honey

32
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
How do you from birds

Own beehive

Turning right

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Maybe by a jar and move on bird and Roxanne will keep on doing what they were doing you do what you were do

36
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Doing

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Except Roxanne.

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Do we make and sell

39
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Candles from beeswax we have or

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Can we use the beeswax to make

41
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Other stuff

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,912
Okay so you can kind of figure out where this is headed because of that of course

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Is what happened

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
And even the rocks and never intended to build a

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
Billion dollar brand or even a million-dollar brand

46
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Get

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Just happened

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
Of course a lot of that had to do with Roxanne

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Passionate

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
And drive but the idea was never to build something massive

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
What's a farmers market product

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Today

53
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,976
Walking to any drugstore in the US or even overseas

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
And you will find an impressive display of Burt's Bees products

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Lip balm lotion soap

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Shampoos

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,472
All labeled with the face of a heavily bearded man named

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Bert

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,640
The likelihood that Roxanne Quimby would build a massive company or any company at all

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,968
Was so implausible back in the early 1980s

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
When she was a single mom waiting tables at a diner

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
And a decade before that

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
She drove across the country from Massachusetts

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Scrum

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
The San Francisco seeking out a simpler life alive

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Without lots of material needs

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
It was

68
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Adventure

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
To go all the way to the West Coast

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
From New England and New York

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
It was a great unknown

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
And I had always wanted to be an artist on the time I was 5 so it seemed like a natural

73
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
Place to go Art School

74
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
I guess you got there in

75
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
But like 1970 around then

76
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
Tell me what tell me what your impression of the San Francisco or like

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
I think San Francisco kind of

78
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Unlocked itself

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
To me while I was there

80
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
It was a pretty little town but the

81
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
Depth of experience that I had their took some time to

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Assimilate and understand you know by

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
I crossed the great cultural

84
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Bridge

85
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
While I was out there

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
What do you mean by that

87
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
I learned

88
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
To think

89
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Differently

90
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
And

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
To probe more deeply

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,815
Everything needed to be re-evaluated and

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Looked at

94
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Again

95
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
So you start to sing

96
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Like what your old the way you thought of the world

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Before versus wrong

98
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Well it was too Limited

99
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
And I think that

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
The material world was

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
Two important

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
And

103
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Really

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
It's not as important as

105
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
I was taught that it was

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
We were encouraged

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
2

108
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,743
Make a good living both of my sisters

109
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,583
Mbas like my dad did and

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,191
Earning power and ones achievements were emphasized

111
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
I took a turn

112
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
To the extreme left

113
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
When I went to art

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
School

115
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Rejected

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
The

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Pursuit of

118
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
Material comfort

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
Who's really quite wonderful

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Yeah

121
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
An insult

122
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Yuan San Francisco and you're

123
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Kind of going through this

124
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
This transformation is personal transformation of rejecting your

125
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Go out earn money kind of

126
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
Where you were raised which was the way many many many

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
People raped

128
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
And

129
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
What did you think did you think I don't need that life I want a different life it was

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
What did you start to think about the life you wanted to have

131
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Well I wanted meaning

132
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
And I wanted to live deeply

133
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
I was

134
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
Very influenced by Thoreau

135
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Who wrote about it

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
Quite beautifully

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
I was looking for Transcendence

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
I just my world just got bigger

139
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
And I felt my relationship with it

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Expanded

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
I guess you had a boyfriend in San Francisco at the time

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
And the two of you decided to like

143
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Go off

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Around the country to find a place to

145
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
The web

146
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Yeah

147
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
This is George Saint Clair

148
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Your boyfriend

149
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
And and

150
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
And so we

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Would you guys do just

152
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
You took off Elissa

153
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Yep.

154
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Saturday I'm sick

155
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
Shh. We had $3,000

156
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
We went to

157
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Vermont

158
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
And the Vermont

159
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Realtor

160
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
That we spoke with

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Sad that

162
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,543
You couldn't buy any land in Vermont for $3,000 but tri-main

163
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,383
So we went to me so your intention was to go

164
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
Somewhere in the country with $3,000

165
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
She Wolf

166
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
How much land you can buy

167
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Yes and why did you want to

168
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Do that what were you going to do on the way

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
There was a movement at the time the back

170
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
To the land movement

171
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Aldosworld

172
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
People that had left City Life

173
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
And

174
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
We're just like a

175
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
I was doing it

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
To strip away everything

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
That civilization had Laird on

178
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Me and see what was really important

179
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
So

180
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
The land that we bought we built a little cabin on it and had

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,807
No running water no electricity and so

182
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
It quickly

183
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Became more aware of

184
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
How those things affected your life

185
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,071
When you didn't have them she had three thousand bucks and how much land did I buy you like how many acres

186
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
30

187
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
That's a lot

188
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
What to do

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
Well there were a few books

190
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,103
You could read about how to build a simple house

191
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
In the woods

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,735
And we would pick people's brains who knew more than we did

193
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,343
They were glad to see some young people moving to Maine because we've had

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Quite an exodus of young people so

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Hayward

196
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Very friendly and helpful

197
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
So I mean

198
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
Did you build a cabin did you build a house on a slab

199
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Yes

200
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
How long does it take to I'm assuming this is

201
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
You get there in the summer is like 70 and 1975 or so some

202
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Like that

203
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
And then how long before you're actually living in a

204
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
A place with a roof over your heads

205
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
How it was the way too long

206
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
We had built a little screen house

207
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,463
Where we were sleeping which was a little ways away from the house we were building

208
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
And

209
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
It was getting into December

210
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
And we are still sleeping outside

211
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Basically it was outside

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,983
Was so hard to get out of bed in the morning out of the sleeping bag

213
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
But you know everything that

214
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Could go wrong

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Take out

216
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
And

217
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Enoteca

218
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
A lot longer than we thought it would

219
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
2

220
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Try to get Undercover

221
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
But

222
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
We had a roof over our heads

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Did you heat

224
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
We had a wood stove

225
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Yeah

226
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
Like this like pre global warming Maine

227
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Into December

228
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Yats

229
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Stream

230
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
But there were others

231
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
You know we weren't the only ones

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615
Do you build a house and you like

233
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
Still no running water electricity or any of that stuff for that but you do have to eat so how are you making a living

234
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Well

235
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,879
The good thing about not having all the amenities is that it doesn't

236
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Take a lot of money

237
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Live

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
We had no

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
Bill's basically other than food

240
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
Cut around firewood and

241
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
Had a source of water which was the spring out in back

242
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
I waitress

243
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
A day or two a week

244
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,103
And George worked at the local radio station for

245
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Add a week

246
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
So couple of days a week we would go out and work for

247
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Things that

248
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Needed cash

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
Are you do this for a couple years right you guys are living like this for

250
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Several years

251
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Yeah

252
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,535
I think we probably lived out there like that for maybe 7 years or so

253
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Wow I can't around

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
Like in the first few years you actually had children

255
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Children who are still in grow their grown up

256
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Date they were born in this

257
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Like Homesteader

258
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Kind of houses out in the middle of

259
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Yeah they have very fond memories of it

260
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
We never had to argue about

261
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
TV shows

262
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Yeah

263
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
So

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
You're living there you're with your waitressing a little bit

265
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
George is working

266
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Get the radio station you got two kids

267
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
But probably still he didn't need a whole lot of money

268
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Get through the day

269
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
No

270
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
We were living on about $4,000 a year

271
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
I'm just trying to get into your head that

272
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Was that your vision for life

273
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Life that you were going cuz it's kind of

274
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
If there is an idyllic about

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
I mean

276
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
You're out there

277
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
You're far away from

278
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
The rough-and-tumble of civilization

279
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Cities

280
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Was that

281
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Your vision for the way you're going to live your life

282
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
It was simply a way of

283
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Having a

284
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
A secure

285
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Home

286
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
And

287
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
I think it was

288
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
I'm very idyllic

289
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Kind of dream

290
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
But ultimately

291
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
It didn't provide enough

292
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Stimulation for my

293
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Personality

294
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Why

295
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
What's your personality

296
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Well I think I'm

297
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
Kind of a Restless person

298
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
Pretty curious

299
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
And

300
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
Interested in the way the world works

301
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
How tall

302
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Put together

303
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
So we were

304
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Pretty cut off out there

305
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
So you guys are out there and

306
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,823
I guess your marriage were or partnership with George Kenosha

307
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Was not in great shape because you guys

308
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
You did separated a certain point right

309
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
We did yeah

310
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Hanna and Lucas were six years old

311
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
And I moved out

312
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
And I moved into another traffic allows even further off the road wow

313
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Is like 80 82 or

314
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
GrubHub Reagan there may be 83

315
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
So you are a single mom

316
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Qkids

317
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
On your own

318
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
That's

319
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Tough going

320
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,015
Well although I was a single mom their dad was a single dad

321
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Right he definitely took

322
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
A lot of responsibility for their care

323
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
And so

324
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Every other week

325
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,839
I had the opportunity to go out and do what I needed to do or

326
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Or whatever sure

327
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
What are you happy

328
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
At that time

329
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Probably not

330
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
You know I don't think about

331
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,943
Being happy that much I feel I think more about being fulfilled

332
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah you feel fulfilled at that time

333
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
I did

334
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,647
Yeah I felt like I was making it On My Own by you know

335
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Living by my wits so to speak yeah

336
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
And I like that and I like the unknown it was an adventure it was sort of like fishing you never knew what you were going to come up

337
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
My boyfriend

338
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,799
And that was always fun at tested you're my resourcefulness I always thought

339
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
That was a good thing too

340
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
To test and keep nimble

341
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Yeah

342
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
So

343
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
You are in Northern

344
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Northern Central Maine

345
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Mid eighties

346
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
And how did you come across

347
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Burt shavitz

348
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Well he was

349
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
He was well-known

350
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
In

351
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
The neighborhood

352
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Because he was so unusual

353
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
What you mean

354
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
Well as usual at the time to write

355
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
Yes but he was probably more than usual

356
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
What do you mean like what do you mean when you said

357
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Well he

358
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
He look like an old rabbi

359
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,343
Anyway he has a long Gray beard and long gray curly hair

360
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
And he was

361
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Bachelor

362
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
And sold honey on the side of the road

363
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
Off the back of his pickup truck

364
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
And you just Neubert through the community you weren't

365
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
ORD 32GB

366
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Meet him on Montfort

367
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Particular day

368
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,871
Well I did meet him personally when he pick me up hitchhiking cuz I didn't have a car.

369
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
The time

370
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,527
So I got to meet him but I think I was vaguely aware of him just because he was one of the fixtures

371
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
In the

372
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
Area and he would sell honey

373
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
From bees that he raised

374
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Stripes

375
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
To eat so you can meet me to cyber and

376
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
He sells honey and

377
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
That's it likes

378
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
See you later and

379
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
And

380
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
And then you go off

381
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Your own separate ways

382
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
Yeah I was waitressing one night or two nights a week

383
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
And

384
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Used to stop in to use

385
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
The Payphone there

386
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
He didn't have a phone

387
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:21,343
And he lived the same way no phone no electricity in a little tiny cabin

388
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
That he had hauled over to his property

389
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
It was a turkey coup

390
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,815
He was quite proud of him

391
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
Very

392
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Very

393
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Eccentric

394
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Hermit

395
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Fellow

396
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
But there must have been some kind of connection that

397
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
You forged because

398
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Yeah I guess you decided to

399
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Yeah

400
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
Oh I was very attracted to him

401
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,231
He was kind of a inspiration for how one could live

402
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
Very independently and with their

403
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Phone unique

404
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Set of

405
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
Rules I was very inspired by his lifestyle

406
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
Of working with him I have some if he wanted any help

407
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
With the bees selling honey or

408
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
No actually tending to the beach so

409
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,975
I followed him around for a summer as an apprentice

410
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
And did a lot of heavy work hauling supers of Honey around

411
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Extracting

412
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
I learned all about the bees and I got to work with Burt what was what was he like was he talking

413
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Zquiet

414
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,455
Yeah he didn't say much

415
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
He was pretty quiet and he's about 15 years older than

416
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
He was about 50 of the time

417
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
I was about 35 I think when I

418
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
When we

419
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Matt

420
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
And

421
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
You just the sky was fascinating

422
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Like he was living this life.

423
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
You wanted to kind of

424
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Model your own life

425
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Yep he was very inspiring to me and you know it's all kind of mixed up with the bees and

426
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Nature

427
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
As well

428
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
It wasn't all inseparable

429
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,599
I understand like when you were you were just really curious about

430
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,671
Bees about his lifestyle and him

431
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
You like Sammy was interesting

432
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
There was no spark in your mind.

433
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Hey maybe we can turn this

434
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Listen to a business

435
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,959
Yeah after the Summer where I apprenticed with him

436
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
I suggested that we

437
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Could

438
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Package the honey

439
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
In nicer containers and

440
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,015
Salad at craft fairs put late little labels on them how was he selling naughty

441
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
Well he was selling them in used gallon jars

442
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,951
Gallon of honey

443
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
I know

444
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Burt funeral like

445
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Let pickles and relish come in

446
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Is the restaurant business

447
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
Cheerleader say they have burtless

448
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Put put it in smaller

449
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Nicer jars and see if we can sell it at like

450
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Farmers markets and stuff

451
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Exactly

452
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Yep

453
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Yeah and he like that idea

454
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Yeah he he was fine with

455
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
So I

456
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Ordered some

457
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Little plastic honey bears

458
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Easy chairs

459
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Yeah

460
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
And we failed both of those

461
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
12 oz of honey

462
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
12 lb

463
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Yeah is how he sold it

464
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
And did you have a

465
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
The label on it and stuff

466
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
Yeah you know we use pictures of bees and

467
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Titanic

468
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Make all these products

469
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Gif

470
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
This was I guess in

471
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
86

472
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:04,319
And today you can imagine going to a craft

473
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:10,463
Artisanal handmade organic non-GMO gluten-free

474
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
Free range fair trade honey from takes like

475
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
Hands like where you marketing at that was just like a bear with honey in it is like

476
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
Honey for sale

477
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
Well we did our best I would say

478
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
We tried to make the packaging really

479
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Cute

480
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
People would want to buy it

481
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
And you know honey is a pretty pure product you don't have to

482
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,879
Sell it too much most people think of it as being

483
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Fairy

484
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Pure

485
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
No additives

486
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
From nature

487
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
So we didn't have to really push that too much

488
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,447
I think we call it pure main honey and so you would start to sell it where

489
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,591
Are we would do Christmas craft fairs at the local high schools and Junior High's in

490
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Right around the area

491
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
You just selling it at these will end in poor people by naughty

492
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Flower sales

493
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Good

494
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
Good like thousands tens of thousands

495
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
200 rounds

496
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Not that good

497
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
I remember

498
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
A

499
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Really

500
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Good show

501
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,959
At the local Junior High where it was $200

502
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
What's the take of the day

503
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
That was a lot of money to me

504
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
How did you guys name go from

505
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Honey 2

506
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Making candles

507
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,391
Well when you extract the honey out of the honeycomb it's capped over with beeswax

508
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
The biggest kind of cabbage

509
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
So it doesn't drain out

510
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,047
So you have to uncap it and you're cutting off the

511
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Beeswax cap

512
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
So that's your

513
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Beeswax

514
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,031
Can I ask you a question about beeswax it's wax it's like really waxy

515
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Soft

516
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Stuff that you

517
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
You can put a wick in Inverness

518
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
How do bees trees how to make

519
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Perry producer

520
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
They have glands

521
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
On their abdomen

522
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
Just like we have saliva glands sure

523
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
So their glands produce

524
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Flat disk

525
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
Except beeswax which they

526
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
Then build into their honeycomb

527
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
So when you pull out like one of those sheets

528
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
About the hive

529
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Honeycomb

530
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
How do you get the wax off

531
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
You have a hot knife

532
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
And you uncap it

533
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Set the hot knife

534
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
And the Beast wax

535
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Pet

536
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Was capping the honeycomb

537
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Becomes

538
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Available

539
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
Call to do whatever you want with it

540
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
So you had all this whack

541
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
End

542
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
Is it pretty easy to just melt it down and turn it

543
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
The candles

544
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
It's simple

545
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
I don't know if it's

546
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
Easy we have

547
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Many disasters

548
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
But

549
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,520
It is a simple process you just heat it up in the beeswax

550
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,848
Separates from the honey and floats on top

551
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,920
So you so you start making candles and then

552
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
And then doing the same thing bring them to craft shows and selling them

553
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Yep

554
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
How had the power sales had to go

555
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
Good instantly instant success

556
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Well we

557
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
Certainly not every show we have

558
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,376
Some real bad shows but good enough to keep going

559
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
So

560
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,240
This is what about a year after you and Bert start working together something like that

561
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
In a three-point did you say

562
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Aeroflot

563
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
If a friend asked you so Roxanne what are you up to

564
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Would you have said

565
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
Yes I'm not going to Miss B thing like what

566
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Orscheln honey and

567
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
And now we're selling candles and it's

568
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
I think this is the something there

569
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Yeah I think I would say that

570
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,560
It was pretty exciting because I was maintaining my

571
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Independence

572
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Using my

573
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
Sense of Aesthetics

574
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
And

575
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,056
Making enough money to live on

576
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
Roughly you know by like 1988 or 18

577
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
I like how many candles are you eat were you selling a year

578
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Well I

579
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
I don't remember exactly how our sales went in the 80s

580
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
But we were growing every year

581
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,328
My original goal was a $20,000 in sales

582
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
And then when that goal was achieved then I set another goal of $1000000 to say

583
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,312
And sales by the time my kids graduated from high school

584
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
So I read that you guys got a

585
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Pretty big break

586
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
In 1989

587
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
There's a boutique in New York

588
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
Cold Zone

589
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Came across your candles.

590
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
At a trade show and then ordered hundreds of them

591
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
Yeah yeah how do they find out about you

592
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
The owner

593
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Or one of his

594
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Buying team

595
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Must have

596
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
Come across us at a show somewhere

597
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
And he ordered our little teddy bear candle it was a little molded

598
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Candle in the shape of a teddy bear with a

599
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
Plaid bow tie

600
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Under his chin

601
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,296
And he sold hundreds of them I didn't use fulfill those orders

602
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
It was you and burden like how did you what you do

603
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Just worked all the time

604
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
No I remember working long hours

605
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Digital hire people

606
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
We started to hire people

607
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Slowly

608
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Some of the local ladies

609
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216
Would come in and give us a hand but

610
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
We were still in a

611
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Building that

612
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Was

613
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Not

614
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,712
Really A place you'd want to have employees work you were acting some birds turkey

615
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
T-Rex

616
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
Just rented out a building to make

617
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Yeah it was an old one-room schoolhouse

618
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
When would you guys call the business

619
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Well

620
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
He had

621
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,096
Kind of a stencil that he had painted onto every beehive that said Burt's Bees

622
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Because the bees were

623
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
All over the countryside

624
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Yeah you couldn't keep them too close together

625
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
So

626
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
We would have maybe 10 hives

627
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
Bearden

628
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
Maybe 10 5/10 miles away there would be another

629
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Beard with 5 or 10

630
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Hives of bees in

631
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
On the hives he would stencil his name

632
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
Eventually it became Burt's Bees

633
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
By the way how did you

634
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Have so much wax

635
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
Did you have to add beehives through a certain point that you have to buy

636
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
Yeah we had to start buying it

637
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
We had 50 Hive switch

638
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
Was fine for a few years and then we didn't produce enough ourselves so we ended up buying other people

639
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Beeswax

640
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
Around 1989 when you got the

641
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
This big order

642
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
From this New York Boutique

643
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
You had to hire an accountant and it was a

644
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
14 year old

645
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
High School Boy

646
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Who became your accounts

647
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Is that

648
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Is that true

649
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
And we called the school

650
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
And we

651
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
Tell them we needed someone good in math

652
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
And so they said oh we have just the fellow he's on the math team

653
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
He came over after school

654
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
I know he would

655
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
Pay the bills and he would do the payroll

656
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
And he would make the deposit and the day that he had to make the deposit walk up to the bank he would wear

657
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Fursuit

658
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,112
It was very important

659
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,696
To maintain our dignity have the bank

660
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,048
So he was our accountant I would say he was more of a bookkeeper

661
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
It's very serious and focused in

662
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Responsible

663
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Yeah I mean

664
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
Roxanne it sounds like you were actually pretty serious

665
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Unfocused

666
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
About this

667
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
But that actually

668
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Converting just stumble into this

669
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
Company but as you saw it

670
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Takeoff and as you saw people

671
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
Show interest in what you were selling

672
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
You are

673
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
Making strategic decisions

674
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
2 time lay the foundation

675
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
For what would become a business

676
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
Yeah it was we were learning a lot

677
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Neither one of us had been

678
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,936
Involved in running and managing a business

679
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
So everything was trial and error

680
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Lot of experimentation

681
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Bar fails

682
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
We

683
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
Went to the School of Hard Knocks

684
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
What was what was the biggest

685
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Disaster

686
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Amber Lyon

687
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
Well I remember 5 gallons of a product we called boot food which was a liquid

688
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Combination of

689
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,096
Melted beeswax neatsfoot oil and

690
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Beargrease

691
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
What's beargrease

692
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Just the facts

693
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
The rendered fat of a bear

694
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
What do you do with that

695
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Pet products

696
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
You rub it into your leather boots

697
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
To waterproof them

698
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,016
Keep the leather supple

699
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Not very well

700
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Spell horrible by God

701
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
I know it was so bad

702
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Oh yeah

703
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
And what happened to this

704
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
It spilled all over the

705
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,912
For 5 gallons of the greasiest smelliest post horrible stuff

706
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
All over the floor

707
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
That was a pretty big

708
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
What's the waist I mean

709
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
We were selling it

710
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Couldn't been

711
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,200
Given your characterization of bird is a

712
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Just kind of

713
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Really independent

714
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
Back to the land kind of guy

715
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,416
What does he think about this growing Enterprise I mean all of a sudden

716
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
Start a business I mean in and not just

717
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,096
Burton rocks and selling jars of honey and wax

718
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Candles but like

719
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
New York boutiques ordering this

720
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,544
I think that he probably wasn't as happy about it as I was

721
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
He had no use for

722
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
Any changes to his lifestyle he didn't have children for one thing

723
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
And I'm

724
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
Far more ambitious than he

725
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Was

726
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah

727
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
But he went along with it because he could see how important it was to me

728
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Was Burt

729
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
Fairly easy to work with or was he like

730
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Stubborn and difficult

731
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
He was a prickly kind of guy

732
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,936
You know he wasn't all warm and fuzzy

733
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
So

734
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
People including myself gave him kind of a wide berth

735
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
We divided up the work

736
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
He would

737
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
Collect all the overdue bills

738
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Overdue

739
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Accounts receivables

740
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
And he was a fixer

741
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,416
When things broke down or needed maintenance he was

742
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Always willing to do that

743
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
And I was

744
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,072
Very Hands-On with the product development

745
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
And

746
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
Getting the product made and shipped

747
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
So we had different roles

748
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
1991 Burt's Bees hits

749
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,616
Amelia half dollars in sales revenue

750
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Do you remember that you remember thinking

751
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,272
My God we are doing a million-and-a-half dollars of Revenue

752
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Well

753
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
I should have remembered it

754
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
But just moving too fast it was moving pretty quickly and we were everyday was a

755
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Another

756
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Problem

757
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
They just had to be solved

758
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
On the Fly

759
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:35,008
Without enough resources or time because we were in hurry

760
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Trying to fill orders

761
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848

762
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
To think that I wasn't expecting this sore

763
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224

798
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,408
Hey bucket back to how I built this from NPR

799
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
The early 1990s

800
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Burt's Bees

801
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
Has just hit a million and a half dollars in Revenue

802
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,696
One thing we did not mention in part 1 which you may have figured out already but

803
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
Roxanne and Burt

804
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Play work

805
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
I was saying the word just business partners but

806
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Romantic Partners as well

807
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
At this time 1990

808
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,056
Recipes with selling mostly candles and other things made with beeswax and

809
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,616
They sold those things mainly at boutiques

810
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
In and around New England and New York

811
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
But in 1991

812
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Roxanne had no idea

813
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
I will take the company in a

814
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Brand new Direction

815
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
You can't reduce the price that would

816
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Go on to become

817
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,792
One of your best songs not your most famous part of your birds bees lip balm how'd you come up with that idea

818
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Well we were making

819
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,424
Other products that were basically

820
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
The same formula

821
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
We were making a furniture polish which was

822
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:21,408
Wax and oil and the boot food basically was wax and oil

823
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,480
And lip balm is basically

824
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Wax and oil

825
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
And

826
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
We put a couple of

827
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
Amenities in it like vitamin E and and peppermint oil but it was very clear that people

828
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
We're more interested in buying

829
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,096
Products for their skin and their lips and their face

830
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
Then they were

831
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Buying

832
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
Products for their furniture and your future

833
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
So once

834
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
That became clear

835
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
We phased out of

836
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,712
All of the other polishes that we were trying to sell

837
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
And

838
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Started focusing on

839
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
On skin

840
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
And we eventually stop making candles as well

841
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
You subbing candles because

842
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
It wasn't profitable or was make sense

843
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
I think because it wasn't

844
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Scalable

845
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
And

846
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
The

847
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,496
Skin care products which were basically blending and filling it was a very simple

848
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
Manufacturing process

849
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
That could easily be

850
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Scale

851
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:29,504
And we were making handmade candles so to go to an automated system

852
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,600
This required a lot more time Machinery in space

853
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
And investment

854
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
That I didn't feel wood

855
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Have the same return so we dropped the candle

856
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
So we're now like in 1991 Burt's Bees is growing

857
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
You hit a million a half dollars

858
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
And you're going

859
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
In One Direction

860
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Sanlitun

861
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
You were

862
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
Counter Culture art student or a homesteader

863
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,920
Living in that you know tencent stuff

864
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,736
But you are kind of starting to become

865
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,832
The Sting that maybe you kind of rejected I'm not criticizing you at all

866
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
I'm just it's just interesting right that you kind of have rejected

867
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
This whole world

868
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
But you had an axe

869
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
I know it's ironic I thought about that

870
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
Did you ever reflect on at that time

871
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
I think I did yeah

872
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,984
Suddenly money became so important

873
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,080
Not for what it would buy but just because it was

874
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,664
Critical to the operation of the business

875
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Keeping track of it

876
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
And

877
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
There I was keeping track of the

878
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
Cash flow money in Money out paying bills sending bills

879
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,696
It was sort of a simple version of

880
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Capitalism

881
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
Which I had rejected

882
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
Years ago ya

883
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
You are not a trained MBA or business

884
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,056
Person but obviously you have some intrinsic Talent me you understood this in a way that

885
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
You could see what Burt's Bees could be

886
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,176
And you were just doing it

887
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,832
Well I had Role Models I had selected out companies and kept them in my mind

888
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
And ideal

889
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
So I had examples cyclic what

890
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,072
I had a big sign over the production floor that said

891
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
Lookout Elizabeth Arden

892
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,448
And you know I really felt like

893
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,312
If if Elizabeth could do it so could we yeah

894
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
So you guys are

895
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Growing

896
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,224
You're hiring are you overwhelmed with how many people

897
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,272
Did you have to hire in Maine

898
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Engines going

899
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:45,184
We had about 45 tell a lot of people to sort of over yeah

900
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Was that hard did you

901
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,096
I mean cuz you at this point I guess you're like a CEO or a de facto CEO is not the official CEO

902
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
I would say that was the most

903
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Challenging part of the job

904
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
With managing people are you juice

905
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
See yourself as a people

906
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Full person

907
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Not that

908
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
Much know I can be

909
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Yeah

910
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
If I have to be but

911
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
Again just going back to my artist

912
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
True self

913
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
Artists usually work alone

914
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,160
They're very comfortable in a writers and Painters

915
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,464
And I I like that Miguel

916
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
I mean would you

917
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Consider yourself

918
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Introvert

919
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
I would say I was pretty introverted yet

920
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,728
Yeah I'm very happy having a very quiet lifestyle

921
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,104
In 1994 you guys made a decision to leave Main and to relocate to North Carolina

922
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Why I mean

923
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
You're such a main person and it was

924
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
Jemaine

925
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Have product

926
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
What what prompted the move

927
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
The location was

928
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:49,696
Very difficult working in the extreme northeast corner of the country

929
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Getting more centralized

930
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,584
What's important for bringing raw materials in and

931
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Getting finished goods out

932
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,800
So North Carolina was much better situated in terms of being halfway between Maine and Florida

933
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,408
And a direct shot out to the West Coast on I-40

934
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
The geography was excellent

935
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
There were other cosmetic companies

936
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
In the area

937
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Revlon was

938
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
About 15 miles away the body shop was about 30 or 40 miles away and there were a lot of pharmaceutical companies

939
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
Things that use a lot of the same

940
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
Glass jars and caps

941
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
And that sort of thing

942
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
So are expenses

943
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Went way down

944
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
We were able to hire

945
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
People who were trained in the industry and who had a

946
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,616
Experience in that industry to come in

947
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
And help ramp up production

948
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
And computerize our office

949
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
Billings

950
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:51,392
There were just a lot more people down there that were trained to do those kinds of things

951
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Yeah

952
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
I am so

953
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
You have this new location and then presumably

954
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Bike equipment and supplies in NJ

955
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
You're like running a fact

956
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Yeah

957
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,984
You know it certainly wasn't a very sophisticated operation

958
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
And it wasn't a state-of-the-art factory right

959
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
But it was doable

960
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,504
We used a lot of used equipment we were making one of our products in a big mixer that

961
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,344
Duke had in its cafeteria for mashed potatoes

962
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,720
And that we we had a bath salt that we were making into cement mixer

963
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,792
So in a Wii with hobbled it together

964
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
Took in the mid-90s cuz I don't remember Burt's Bees in the mid-90s right

965
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,752
Where would you have seen a Burt's Bees lip balm or lotion or soap

966
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
You would have found it in a independent gift shop little small gift shops

967
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Dotted all over the country

968
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
And it was just organic growth

969
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,832
Based on these small gift shops all over the country

970
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Andrea marketing

971
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
We were doing a

972
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
Kind of a Grassroots marketing

973
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
We would make little sample products

974
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,584
And we were giving those away

975
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,400
People we also had catalogs

976
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
That were

977
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
Almost like a current-day Blog it would be our products but it would also talk a little bit about

978
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Company in

979
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:22,016
I told stories about Burt and his dog and some ingredients stories

980
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:27,136
He's so people would follow the story so that was kind of a thread that they would follow

981
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
When did you design

982
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
Now iconic

983
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Logo of

984
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Bert's face

985
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
On the packaging was that there from the beginning

986
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
We had a great artist

987
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
He is

988
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,800
Lives up here in Maine and he did a woodcut portrait

989
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Of birth

990
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
And we started putting that on the package

991
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Few years into the program

992
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,784
That was a very conscious decision to use Burt's face

993
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,088
Because I was

994
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
I guess

995
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
A little

996
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
Resentful

997
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,256
Of the way women were used

998
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
To Market

999
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
Products

1000
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
And

1001
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
I saw

1002
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Some of the big

1003
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
Cosmetics lines

1004
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Really exploiting

1005
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
The image of women

1006
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
And defining them

1007
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:24,992
Through the advertising and packaging in a way that did not respect

1008
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
They're full

1009
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Gap

1010
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
So

1011
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
It was important for me not to follow that

1012
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Weed

1013
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
It's so interesting because I would have thought that you would have

1014
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,512
First face on there because

1015
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,656
You know of the authenticity of this guy who was really the real deal he was a beekeeper in a Hermit and

1016
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
You know the consumer was connecting with this

1017
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,776
Authenticity like that's why I would have thought you would

1018
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
But it was it was about sexism

1019
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Yeah I think that

1020
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,711
You know we had to do with authenticity and invert

1021
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
But it also had to do with

1022
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Gender X

1023
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Deportation that

1024
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
The beauty products were

1025
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
I think they were known for

1026
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
Known as a woman who

1027
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
Could never measure up

1028
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
To this glamorous

1029
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,263
Image that one found in mainstream cosmetics and beauty products that you know I felt like I'm

1030
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,311
I'm not I don't want to do that to women

1031
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,871
So we're going to put a picture of

1032
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
A guy that everybody is going to feel

1033
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
More beautiful than

1034
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
So alright so you guys are in North Carolina

1035
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
Running this company is

1036
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
It's a late 90s

1037
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Were you

1038
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
Able to pay yourself a decent salary

1039
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
Well at one point before we left main we decided to pay ourselves $36,000 a year

1040
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,495
I didn't spend a lot of money I didn't need a lot of money

1041
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
And

1042
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
1999

1043
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Bird eggs

1044
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
It's you you buy them

1045
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,175
When you Incorporated your 2/3 C 2/3

1046
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
You buy him out and he kind of

1047
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Retires

1048
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Yeah

1049
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Although he

1050
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,111
I think enjoyed

1051
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,903
Going out on the road

1052
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
And being burnt

1053
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
Yeah in signing t-shirts

1054
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
And tapping the mascot

1055
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Yeah

1056
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,911
When he sort of was out of the picture

1057
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,287
What was your personal relationship with him damaged or you not getting along from your perspective

1058
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Yeah that was pretty much what it was

1059
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
Our relationship had gone South

1060
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
And

1061
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
If you don't mind

1062
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
Well it was sort of a personal transgression that was

1063
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
Very hurtful to me

1064
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
And

1065
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
It kind of pop the bubble

1066
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Anyway

1067
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,167
Took a lot of inspiration from Bert and his lifestyle and his authenticity and

1068
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
Is independence

1069
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
And I found him to be

1070
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Quite admirable

1071
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
So after the

1072
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Break up

1073
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
I'm lost

1074
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
A lot of inspiration

1075
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
He had this

1076
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:06,783
Yeah

1077
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Alright so

1078
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,607
If This Were A Movie Roxanne 2.0 movie where like

1079
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,471
You would just go to the end-of-year b99 13.8 million

1080
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
2030 million 2000 160 million

1081
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,455
Counting big stacks of cash and you know smoking cigars

1082
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,063
But it is phenomenal like how do you go from 30 million

1083
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
260 million in one year

1084
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,231
Was it just phenomenal salespeople was it like what was going on

1085
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
Well it was scalable

1086
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Every part of it was scalable once we automated filling it just make more

1087
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,007
More product yeah turn it to 11 yeah

1088
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Fabulous

1089
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,871
And just more and more stores were asking for these products

1090
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,503
We spent a lot of time focused on the consumer

1091
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
So they would

1092
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Try the product and they would want to go to the store and get a full-size product and they would ask for it and if a cuss

1093
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,279
After a product that's a great sign if your store ran out

1094
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,119
The customer came back for more wasn't there they would ask

1095
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
Hey where's the Burt's Bees so

1096
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,727
That kind of a pulling strategy from

1097
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
From the consumer

1098
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
Really helped a lot with growth

1099
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,455
And it was a Tipping Point where it seemed that everybody knew about it

1100
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:45,599
You know when from nobody knowing about it to everybody knowing about it and I'm not exactly sure

1101
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
What

1102
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,951
That Tipping Point was but it took on a life of its own

1103
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
You

1104
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Sell 80% of your

1105
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Shares

1106
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
The company in

1107
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
2003

1108
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
2 hour

1109
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
An investment firm

1110
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Not clear how much money

1111
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
But a lot of

1112
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Pens

1113
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
Of millions of dollars

1114
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,663
Unsettling about all the sudden coming into

1115
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Yeah more money than

1116
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Adevarul

1117
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Imagine

1118
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,575
I'm not really know I wasn't unsettled by it

1119
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
I was thinking about the ex

1120
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,671
Exit strategy very early on

1121
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Is that because you just didn't want to

1122
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Deal with the hassle of running a company

1123
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
Yep it was something that became

1124
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,375
Somewhat routine after a while

1125
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Going to big box and

1126
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,311
Drugstore chains didn't seem very exciting or creative to me but it was clearly the next

1127
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Stop

1128
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
So

1129
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
I felt like

1130
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
It was time to

1131
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,247
To turn it over to the professionals

1132
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
And I just

1133
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,647
Trouble very constrained very disconnected from what originally was

1134
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
An inspiration

1135
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Army

1136
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
Imagine

1137
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,303
So you go you're gone at this point 2003

1138
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
You really leave the come

1139
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Eat you

1140
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
Became very wealthy

1141
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
From

1142
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
This tiny little

1143
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Company that

1144
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
You just

1145
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Started accidentally

1146
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
I mean it's a pretty remarkable right

1147
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:19,039
Yeah I guess so I mean I don't live two different Levi I have a more freedom now than I did

1148
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
When I had no money but

1149
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:25,439
In a certain sense I have a lot of freedom then also because I had nothing to lose

1150
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,999
Yeah that whole theme of

1151
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
Freedom is important

1152
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
Timmy

1153
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Always has been

1154
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Meantime you were really

1155
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
Starting to become passionate about

1156
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,983
Conserving and preserving land

1157
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
Starting in Maine

1158
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
And you've given away

1159
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Huge amount of your money

1160
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,223
By buying land in Maine and all the country and giving it to

1161
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Federal government to Maine

1162
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
And other state agencies to develop parks

1163
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Yep

1164
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Start to become your passion

1165
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,279
Well I had been living on the land up there for

1166
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Ears

1167
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
So I knew it

1168
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
And

1169
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
With most

1170
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
Beauty care companies

1171
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
A lot of money

1172
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,799
That they generate goes into advertising

1173
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:17,919
Yeah I've heard even the 25 cents of every dollar goes into advertising

1174
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
Sing so we didn't have that expense

1175
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
Because you know guerrilla marketing and and Grassroots marketing is not very expensive hell and we had

1176
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
Put all the money we needed to into growing the business at

1177
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
Still have excess cash

1178
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
And I felt like

1179
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,119
We needed to find a very solid investment

1180
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,191
And soul and seem to be

1181
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Rock-solid to me

1182
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
Yeah but I'm President Obama named

1183
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Anu

1184
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
National Monument

1185
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
Larzelere and that land that you

1186
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
You donated to the national parks

1187
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
Katahdin woods and Waters

1188
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,551
Katahdin mountain in Maine

1189
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,647
2015

1190
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Shavitz

1191
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
That's the way he was eight

1192
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,535
A remarkable got a really fascinating person

1193
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
A film about him

1194
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
Which is really interesting and

1195
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
The point where you said something that

1196
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
Probably was alone hurtful he said I never want to see

1197
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
Again

1198
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
But

1199
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,127
Have you kind of made peace with him and in his memory in your relationship

1200
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
Oh yeah I have

1201
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
I was in love with Bert

1202
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:27,295
Yeah and we went through a lot of changes together

1203
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
Had this

1204
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
Child

1205
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
Burt's Bees together

1206
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Raised it up

1207
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
Off it went

1208
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,327
I still feel very very close to birth

1209
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
I think about him a lot

1210
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
He was a quiet in his

1211
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
Inspiration to me a muse

1212
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Did you have a chance to talk to Burt before he died

1213
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,103
In a certain way

1214
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
Yeah

1215
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:58,527
I was about to visit him and my girlfriend went up to visit him the afternoon before I was planning to go

1216
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,647
And she called me to let me know that she didn't think

1217
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
He was going to last much longer

1218
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,023
So we sort of had up phone

1219
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
Yeah

1220
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,447
Correspondence and he did actually pass away later that day so I did miss

1221
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,847
Seeing him in person but I just remember him you know at his prime

1222
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
Some people

1223
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
I criticized you

1224
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Because

1225
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
Well you got me

1226
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Most of the money out of the company

1227
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
Do you know

1228
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
It's much what's your feeling

1229
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Habitat crew

1230
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
I feel that

1231
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,511
I was the more responsible

1232
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Party

1233
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
For managing wealth

1234
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
I could

1235
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Do the right thing with it

1236
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,775
And I don't know whether Burt would have really used it very productively

1237
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
He came from a family that had

1238
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
Samwell

1239
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,919
And he chose not to use it

1240
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
He didn't do anything

1241
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
To help

1242
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
The community

1243
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
With the wealth that he did have

1244
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
And I felt like

1245
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,511
That was something that I could do and have been doing

1246
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,559
Do you plan to give away most of your wealth

1247
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,095
Before you die

1248
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
That's hard that's a lot of work isn't

1249
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Figuring out where to go

1250
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:26,335
We should go and feelings all the incoming pictures and all the people who want some of your money and never get tired

1251
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Well I have

1252
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,967
Both of my children each are working

1253
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,063
So they have responsibility for Distributing

1254
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
Funds every year to

1255
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
Grantees

1256
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,463
According to the mission that makes sense to them

1257
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
So I do have help

1258
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
And I'm pretty spontaneous

1259
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,143
About the way I distribute grants

1260
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
I don't have a real formal

1261
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
System

1262
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
I just

1263
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
But you know either

1264
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
Rings true to me or it doesn't

1265
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Yeah

1266
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,943
When you see Burt's Bees today it's going well my Clorox

1267
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
Givenchy purse by Clarksburg

1268
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Billion dollar

1269
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
A 2007

1270
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Unbelievable

1271
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
You see it everywhere

1272
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
CVS

1273
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Walmart 7-Eleven is it

1274
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,719
Tubing with pride is it is a wonderful

1275
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
You'll see that

1276
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,071
I don't pay that much attention to it I guess

1277
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,679
You know I mean I certainly notice it when I'm at Whole Foods and I walked by the

1278
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,519
Burt's Bees display always catches my eye

1279
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
But I think

1280
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,383
I've let it go you know in many ways I just

1281
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
It's something

1282
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
Apart from me now

1283
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
So the question I asked everybody was

1284
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Put on the show rock

1285
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Nasty witches

1286
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,111
How much of your story in the success of this

1287
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Do you think it's because of

1288
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,183
Your skill in your intelligence

1289
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
And you are working how much of it

1290
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
Because of just a lock

1291
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
Well I was born on July 11th

1292
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Which is 7-Eleven

1293
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
Also I

1294
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,959
Have felt lucky

1295
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
For a long time

1296
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
You certainly have to work hard but

1297
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,919
When I look back at some of the critical events that were

1298
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Heart of

1299
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
The destiny of this adventure I certainly couldn't have pulled those off that had

1300
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
Ftb locked door

1301
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,487
Divine intervention and there's been so many of those

1302
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:23,071
The right people came to me at the right time

1303
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
So

1304
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
That has got to be luck

1305
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
That's Roxanne Quimby

1306
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,263

Slip on eucalyptus

1317
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471

Technology is accelerating faster than ever

1325
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,583
And things that once felt far off

1326
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
Are making a real impact

1327
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399

Microsoft

1331
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
.com

1332
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Slash

00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,919
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it

1334
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
It's time now for how you built that

1335
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,991
And today

1336
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
We're talking about

1337
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,575
Dating app

1338
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:53,183
Any dating app this is Carlos and his dog Hugo and Carlos

1339
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:58,815
I'm a single dad of a sweet Wheaten Terrier who loves to play and make new friends

1340
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,143
This is a dating app with profiles of people

1341
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
And their dogs

1342
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
Very friendly and well-educated never bites

1343
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:10,079
Always wagging his tail let's go to the park and let's get your dogs to play

1344
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:16,735
So the voice you just heard is Lee Isaacson and her story starts in 2016 when her younger sister Casey

1345
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,319
Had this country breakup she was dating a guy

1346
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,391
Tried to be a dog person for her

1347
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791
By the end of the relationship he didn't want the dog in his apartment he would put towels down on the couch so the dog

1348
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
I didn't touch anything

1349
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:37,471
And she came to me and said I wish I just knew from the start that this wasn't going to work because of my dog

1350
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
Citrus.

1351
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:44,639
Could there be a dating app that might solve this problem and app that goes beyond Tinder

1352
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,735
An app where someone like Casey could stay up front

1353
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,759
Me and my dog

1354
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:56,159
We are a package deal she has a Cavapoo and there is truly nothing that looks more like a teddy bear than her dog

1355
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,975
It's always said you know someone can't like this

1356
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,375
Then clearly you know you need to find someone without at least a little bit more dog person in them

1357
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
They start to kick around this idea and they realized the way people take care of their dogs can say a lot

1358
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:17,151
What about their personalities how much money do you spend on your pets or other things in the house

1359
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,455
You know how clean you keep your house

1360
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,783
Things like that might predict whether to dog owners

1361
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Are we compatible

1362
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
Does your dog sleep in the bed or out of the bed do you let your dogs on furniture you always pick up dog poop on the

1363
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:37,119
That's a big one that's a big one and by the way if you are listening and you have a dog please to pick up the dog poop off

1364
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:37,887
Off the sidewalk

1365
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
Just a favor I'm asking

1366
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
Anyway in July of 2017

1367
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:47,871
Sisters began developing their app only has a background in journalism and Casey works in

1368
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:52,223
Advertising design they had never done anything like this before

1369
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,575
Surfers they pulled their money together and their dad put in a little bit to

1370
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,391
They got into an accelerator program

1371
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:04,255
Spaced out a cheap Tech officer and a team of developers to help them build the app

1372
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:09,887
We actually went through for development teams because Liam Casey had a hard time finding

1373
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:15,519
Just the right match that can be very scary when you have a limited amount of money

1374
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,591
To build this product and you see it either

1375
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:24,991
Taking forever or you know not looking the way you want it to and watching your money drain at the same time

1376
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,575
But after 7 months there dating app was ready

1377
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
And they launched it

1378
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
On Valentine's Day

1379
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:36,767
We weren't the first dating app out there so we were able to learn from a lot of other people's mistakes

1380
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:41,375
There have been interesting dating apps that I've tried to launch nationally

1381
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
And they get a lot of attention really quickly

1382
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,311
But because you need a lot of people in one place in order for a dating app to work

1383
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,175
They just fell apart so we decided to get the word out city-by-city

1384
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,711
Starting in New York

1385
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,783
They thought this would be the best way to build their user base

1386
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
We even hosted events in each City these big dog friendly parties pet companies paid the sea

1387
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:11,583
Set up booths that revenue and dog owners well they're always looking for places to bring their dogs

1388
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,911
So they would come and stay in England

1389
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
After each launch

1390
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
We can Casey saw a spike in new users we knew that was nothing more valuable than getting a lot

1391
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
I have people in the app

1392
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:30,015
So are you there could find more people that match with seven more cities la

1393
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,111
Boston San Francisco Detroit New Orleans Austin and Chicago

1394
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:39,231
And they're bringing in more Revenue by charging pad companies to put ads on the app

1395
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,815
This means after a year they've been able to keep the app

1396
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
3

1397
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
We are Texans app

1398
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
It's called Big has more than 20,000 users and growing and yes she knows what some of you sing

1399
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,823
People with cats are thinking

1400
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,223
Where's my app we get the cat question all the time you know surprisingly we actually get

1401
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,831
The horse question all the time course people definitely need to have their own conversations to

1402
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
But for now

1403
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
Big is all about the dogs

1404
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,951
And the people who love them

1405
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
