Hey just a heads up to let you know that there's a little bit of strong language in about the first minute and a half

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Are the show soap

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
If you got the kids register

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
Cover their ears for men men and a half in the

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Can you get to go

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
So you called your dad like that guess what I'm drawing the family business

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
How to make beer whiskey I was worse I went home and and was he excited

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
Really but I told him I was kind of hoping that he put his arm around me and

14
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
Cuz this 150 year old family tradition was going to be carried on no heel

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
Look at my gym you've done some really stupid things in your life this is this

16
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Stupidest from NPR is how I

17
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movements they built

18
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Today Show

19
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,320
Jim Cook started Brewing an old family beer recipe called at Samuel Adams bottle it up

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
And then helped kick-start the craft beer movement

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
In America

22
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
It's a boy last year the number of breweries in America past the 4000 mark

23
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
Most of us breweries make

24
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,568
Craft beer seems like ipas Porter Stout sloggers you name it

25
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Beer that wins Awards all over the world

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,992
And a lot of it even gets exported to places like Germany in Holland and Belgium

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
Beer brewing is practically a religion

28
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
But if somehow

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
He went back in time to like 1980

30
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,512
And someone handed you a cold bottle of American Beer

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
You might not recognize it because

32
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
A mighty python fans might remember this

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
American Beer used to be a joke

34
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
So that was what it was like when Jim Cook was a young man but he knew a lot about beer because he

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,184
She happened to come from a family of beer makers my dad was a broom

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
And

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like being a chef

38
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
In the kitchen

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
He was responsible

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
4

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
The recipe and

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
The quality

43
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Of

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
The berry wasn't the only

45
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
So

46
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
He got out of brewmaster School in 19

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
48

48
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
There were a thousand breweries all over the US

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,968
36 years later when I started Sam Adams that thousand had dwindled down to

50
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
250

51
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
And my dad

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Bad

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
To move from Brewery to brewery as

54
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
The breweries closed

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
Did you have any

56
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Intention like as a kid or as a

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Teen of

58
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
I like doing this doing the same thing your dad did

59
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
No

60
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
My dad

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Told me that it was a miserable way to make a living

62
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
And he eventually left

63
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
The Brewing industry

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Entirely

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
The last thing that he wanted for me to do

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Was to go

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Back into Brewing

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Crazy cuz if they were like it wasn't

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
His dad

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
Every oldest son for six Generations

71
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Has been

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
Brewer

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
I believe I'm the only

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
6th generation

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Brewer in the United

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Is States

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
What did you do

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Actually I really didn't know

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
You know I had this wonderful Edge

80
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Educational

81
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Opportunity

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
That nobody in my family

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Had ever had

84
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
I after I graduated from

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
College

86
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
Started a JD MBA program

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
And I could just feel this

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
Pressure behind me pushing me

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Towards

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Some career decision

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
So

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
I dropped out

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
So what would you do that

94
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Well

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
At the time I was involved in a

96
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Lot of outdoor activities

97
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,607
Rock climbing kayaking backpacking

98
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Things like that

99
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
And my climbing partner

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
He got me involved

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
In

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Outward Bound

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
I was able to do that

104
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
During the summer

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Bars and then

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Hyatt

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
I learned that

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
You don't need

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
That much to live on

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
If you're really enjoying what you're doing

111
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
And so how many years did you take

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Did you do that for

113
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,743
I did it on and off for three and a half years

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
At the end of that three and a half years I thought okay

115
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
I think I'm ready to go back

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
And got my

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
MBA in

118
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
My JD

119
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
And

120
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Dave started

121
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Working as a Management Consultant

122
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
4

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
A company called Boston Consulting Group

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
And you

125
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
We flew first class you know you

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
You consulted

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
CEOs and retreated

128
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Really well

129
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
It was great job

130
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
For a while

131
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Yeah that's pretty good

132
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Why did you leave

133
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Redis

134
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Epiphany

135
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,839
I guess after 6 years it

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Bcgi

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Ask myself

138
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
I want to do this the rest

139
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
My life

140
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
And the answer came back

141
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
No

142
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
The next

143
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
So the corollary to that was look I don't do it for the rest of my life

144
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Probably don't want to do it

145
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
Tomorrow

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
So how did that like

147
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
That decision

148
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Lead to hit you think you have beer

149
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
That's a good question and

150
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
I knew I didn't want to work in the corporate

151
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
So I thought I'm going to start my own business

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
I don't know what it's going to be

153
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
My dad had given me

154
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Actually copy of Inc magazine

155
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
And there was an article in there

156
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
About Anchor Steam

157
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Is this

158
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Small Brewery in California it was owned by

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Great guy named Fritz Maytag

160
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
And

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Fritz

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Had a viable

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Small

164
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Brewery

165
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
It was an outlier

166
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
When I was

167
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Consulting

168
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
What always fascinated me

169
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
With the outlier

170
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Because that's where the real learning was

171
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,423
There was obviously the potential to find a market

172
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
For a really high-quality beer

173
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
And I started to think

174
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
About it and

175
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
I

176
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Developed a different

177
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Business model

178
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
For what is now called

179
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Craft brewing

180
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
So this is in the mid-80s right

181
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Yeah 1984

182
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
So you

183
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
You called your dad like that guess what I'm joining the family business I'm going to make beer whiskey I was worse I went home

184
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
And was he excited

185
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Not really

186
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
When I told him

187
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
I was kind of hoping that he

188
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Put his arm around me and

189
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Cuz this

190
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
150 year old family tradition was going to be

191
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
Carried on to yet another generation know he looked at me sit gym you've done

192
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Some really stupid things in your life this is the stupidest

193
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
My scrub

194
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,303
Pause for second Askew kids

195
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
You have this great

196
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Job

197
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
And you just left

198
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Yes and I left it

199
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Because

200
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
Staying there was very

201
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Risky

202
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Leaving it was not risk

203
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
And it's the difference in life

204
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Between things that are scary

205
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
And things that are dangerous

206
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
And there are plenty of things that are

207
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Scary but aren't

208
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Dangerous

209
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
And there are

210
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Things that are

211
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Dangerous

212
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
But not

213
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Scary

214
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Yeah and

215
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Those are the things that get you

216
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
That can give you a climbing an alloy

217
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
From Outward Bound

218
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
1 things we

219
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Tough people do was

220
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Rappel off

221
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
Cliff and they're really it's a very scary

222
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Thanks

223
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
To do but you're also held

224
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
Buy a belay rope

225
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
And that rope

226
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Ahold

227
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Har

228
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
So walking up the

229
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
The cliff backwards is scary but not Danger

230
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Yeah okay

231
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Walking across

232
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
You know what

233
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
35

234
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Degree angles

235
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Snowfield on a

236
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Beautiful

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
You know later

238
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Mets

239
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Afternoon

240
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Bright blue

241
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Sky

242
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
It's not

243
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Scary at all but it's

244
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Very dangerous

245
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Because

246
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
The snow is melting

247
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
Eventually it's going to find a layer of ice

248
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
The water will lubricate that and you have an avalanche

249
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,551
That is dangerous but not scary

250
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
In my situation

251
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Staying at BCG

252
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Was dangerous but not scary in the

253
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
The danger there the risk

254
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Was

255
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Continuing to do something

256
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
It didn't make me happy

257
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
And getting

258
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
You know 65 and looking back and go oh my God I wait

259
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,687
Wasted my life that is risk that is danger

260
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
Citadel was that what you said your dad did you convince him that this was

261
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Worth trying

262
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
He eventually

263
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Did

264
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Come around

265
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
You know I sat down with him

266
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
The thing that

267
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Convinced him I think

268
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
All the American breweries

269
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
Basically making the same kind of beer yeah you know very light

270
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Very easy to drink

271
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
And

272
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
I'm not going to compete

273
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
With bud

274
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
And Miller and Coors

275
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Everybody in the US who wants

276
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Good beer is drinking the import

277
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
So is that that time it was like

278
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,367
Heineken bags St Paulie girl

279
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Those were considered

280
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
The great beers of the world

281
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
And what I did know from my Brewing background is

282
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
They are not the Great

283
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Beers

284
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
The world

285
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
The Dare

286
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Was

287
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
The possibility

288
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Making

289
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Beer with a lot of flavor

290
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
The balance

291
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
And there's a

292
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Particular flavor structure of good beer

293
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
When you taste it

294
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
You will get that structure

295
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
And

296
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
I could give it to people

297
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Fresh because beer is parachute

298
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
Beer has about a four to five months shelf life

299
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Any imported beers

300
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
We're almost always stale

301
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
They were typically in green and

302
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Beer bottles

303
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
And

304
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Visible light

305
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Isomerize is a compound in Hobbs

306
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
That's why you get skunky beer

307
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
What you come up with

308
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
With a recipe that

309
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
N0 you thought okay this is going to re-educate American Beer

310
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Why drink this beer

311
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Instead of what are you say

312
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
That was easy

313
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,271
After about an hour and a half when I dad was beginning to get it

314
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Oh and you know you're right

315
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Nobody's making great beer

316
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,999
Maybe somebody should do that then you took me up into the attic and there was a

317
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Trunk and

318
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
There were family recipes

319
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Any took out one of the recipes

320
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
And said this is the rest

321
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
It was from my great-great-grandfather's Brewery

322
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
My dad

323
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Handmade

324
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
A version of this beer

325
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,711
At wooden shoe Brewery in Minster Ohio where he was brewmaster

326
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Because the brewery was kind of going down the tubes

327
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
Any thought maybe we can turn the brewery around by making big

328
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
American

329
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Lager

330
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
And the owner

331
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Tasted it

332
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Told my days at Charlie

333
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Nobody is going to drink huh

334
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
People want

335
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Water with

336
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Beaumont

337
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
So make water with foam on

338
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
So you just took this recipe in and start to experiment with us

339
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,895
Yams at the recipe I started making it in my kitchen

340
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Adam is

341
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Extremely difficult beer to make

342
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
You can't really do this as a home

343
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Yeah it requires

344
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Much more precise

345
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Control

346
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
A Brutus

347
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
And I could

348
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
Tell this is going to be a good beer if I can make this right

349
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
This would be a really good beer

350
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Okay so you make a beer but how did you

351
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
Because you didn't know how to add a begin

352
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Start a beer company

353
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Well the first thing

354
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
I realized I had to find the best brewmaster

355
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
In America

356
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
To help me

357
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
I'm he was a man named dr. Joseph away.

358
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
And he was

359
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
The first

360
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
American Brewmaster

361
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Combine

362
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
High level

363
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,719
Scientific understanding cuz he was a PhD

364
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Microbiology

365
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
With

366
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Decades of practice

367
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,887
Gold experience how did you even convince him to get involved in your life

368
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Fly-by-night startup

369
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
He turned me down at first

370
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Here. This is

371
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Really crazy

372
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
And

373
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
You don't have enough money to pay me

374
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Yeah which was true

375
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
And I took

376
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Dr. Wade East

377
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
I'm not some

378
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
You know idiot kid

379
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Just making beer in their kitchen

380
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
My dad

381
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Was a brewmaster my grandfather and

382
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
He remembered my dad

383
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
A little bit

384
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
I said well

385
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
I'll tell you what

386
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
I'll give you 2% of the

387
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
And that

388
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Piqued his interest

389
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
He signed on

390
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
And he helped me adapt a $0.19

391
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Entry recipe

392
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
20th century

393
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Brewery

394
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
So did you have to go out

395
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Raise money to

396
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Build a brewery

397
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Well

398
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
I realized

399
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
There are breweries out there

400
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
And my dad was the one who gave me this insight

401
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
What we did

402
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Is

403
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
We rented space

404
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
Dr. Wade Easton I showed up

405
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Brewed beer

406
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
And

407
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Then

408
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
They packaged it

409
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
And I

410
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,887
Didn't have to have my own Brewery for several years

411
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
When we started

412
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
We didn't have

413
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Things that you think you need for business

414
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
We don't have an office

415
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
We didn't have a telephone

416
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Yeah I just

417
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Ask myself

418
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Am I spending money

419
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
On things

420
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
That are going to make the beer batter

421
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
Or am I spending money on things just because that's what you're supposed to spend it on

422
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Come up with a name

423
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Santa Ana

424
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Well

425
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
It came from my

426
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
History teacher when I was a junior in high school. The revolution

427
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
She highlighted the role

428
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Of Samuel Adams

429
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
Depending on what books you read he was a brewer

430
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
You know

431
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
I wanted a name that was

432
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,335
Assertively American that reflected

433
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
America's

434
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,687
History and tradition etcetera etcetera

435
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
So on the label

436
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
There it is Brewer Patriots and

437
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,623
I wanted to do what Sam Adams it done

438
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
Only my little way I wanted to create

439
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Beer Revolution

440
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
And declare their independence

441
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
For the United States

442
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,335
You just met will be back with him cook and he'll explain how he actually convinced people

443

Amazing one

476
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Do they sell Instagram

477
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Okay back to the show

478
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
It's how I built this from NPR

479
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
And I Rise

480
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Experimenting for a few months with a family recipe

481
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,463
Jim Cook finally got it down to exactly the way he wanted

482
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
At this point

483
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
He had to figure out

484
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Has salad

485
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
So

486
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
My dad told me you know you can start a business

487
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
It's lonely

488
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
It's going to have its ups and downs

489
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
See if you can find a partner

490
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
So I looked around

491
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
BCG was full of like the best and the brightest from

492
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
The top

493
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Business Schools

494
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Somehow

495
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
I couldn't see

496
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
Them be my partner cuz they are all the same skills I had

497
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Yeah

498
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Realize wait a minute there is a person who

499
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Is

500
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Energetic talented

501
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Resourceful

502
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Great people person

503
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Has

504
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
All the skills that I don't really have

505
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
She was my secretary

506
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
So it was just me

507
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
And Rhonda

508
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
She was

509
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
23 years old

510
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
No College

511
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Degree

512
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Bartended at night

513
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
We were the perfect complement

514
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
That attitude

515
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
You guys convinced

516
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Bars in

517
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Chop stew

518
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
To take your beer

519
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Well I was hoping

520
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,279
Did I would get a distributor well there were five beer distributors in Boston

521
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
I went to each one of them they all turned me down

522
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Because because

523
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,983
To them it looks like a stupid idea this was a beer

524
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,567
That had a lot of color had a lot of flavor and had a lot of taste

525
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
This was in the Heyday of Light beer and you know they'd ask me okay so what's your marketing plan

526
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
Marketing plan what's your advertising budget

527
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
I don't have any money for advertising

528
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Will tell me about the company

529
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
It's me

530
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,487
And my 23 year-old ex-secretary so wasn't very

531
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,303
Confidence as a business

532
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
And the only way that I could

533
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Get my beer

534
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Out there

535
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Was

536
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
I would put

537
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
Cold beer in

538
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
My briefcase every morning I could fit seven beers

539
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
And I had these two blue cool pack

540
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
Sleeve of cups

541
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
And

542
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
I went

543
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
From bar to bar cold calling just going walking in the managers and yeah trying to do

544
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Get to him

545
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
I never sold anything in my life

546
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Was that hard for you

547
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Yes

548
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
I was sure I remember to this day doing my first sales

549
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
And

550
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Hit the streets in Boston I remember I was

551
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Okay

552
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
I'm just going to call in the first bar

553
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
That I come to you

554
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
And I came to

555
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
A bar

556
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
I didn't know what I was doing and I have my

557
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Consultant Sudan

558
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,783
So I started talking to the guy behind the bar and he was nodding and I thought that's a good sign

559
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
But he wasn't saying anything

560
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
Luckily

561
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
In the back was the manager

562
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Cuz the guy I was talking

563
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Into which What's called the Barbie

564
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,815
The barback is the guy who likes stocks the glasses and

565
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
That this guy didn't speak English

566
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,215
So he was just nodding away managing his back think

567
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
Oh my gosh there's a guy in a suit here he's talking to my barback

568
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,151
He's either IRS or he's Immigration and Naturalization Services

569
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
It neither one of those

570
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Seattle we rushed up

A new beer

577
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
I'm going to call it it's called Sam Adams

578
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
And

579
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
My real

580
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Point was

581
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
To get them to try the

582
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
So

583
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
You know I build up to this in

584
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
Sitting would you like to

585
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,591
Try it out he said sure leave me a bottle I said oh it's cold

586
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
I have some cups here

587
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Let me pour you

588
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
Before he could say no and of course

589
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
In the bar business

590
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
If you pour beer

591
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
You can't just throw it out

592
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Yeah

593
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
So

594
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
We tried it together

595
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
He said kid

596
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
You know I didn't think the beer was going to be this good

597
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
I'll take

598
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
And I was so excited

599
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
And of course I went back and

600
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Actually Rhonda was

601
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
Taking some time off before we start I called I was so excited

602
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Rhonda you know

603
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
We got our first customer

604
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Industry practice

605
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
How many cases did he order

606
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
I forgot

607
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
So I had to go back the next day and apologized and I was scared again that he would have liked changes my

608
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
Reminder anyting but he gave me a 10 case order

609
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,632
Services like 1985

610
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
And you launch and

611
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,336
You got to get some attention and your 6 weeks after Sam Adams came out yeah

612
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,176
It got picked as the best beer in America how did that happen

613
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
It happened out in Denver Colorado

614
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
It was at the

615
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Great American Beer Fest

616
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
Pretty much beers from every Brewer

617
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
And

618
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Babe

619
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Went around over tonight

620
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
Taste of the beers everybody got to vote for the best beer

621
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
And they did this countdown

622
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,448
You have 10 9 a.m. I thought we'd finish in the top 10

623
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
But they

624
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,568
You know they kept getting lower and lower

625
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Announce

626
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
You know

627
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Anna's

628
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,968
Number to the second best beer in America is this and

629
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Psyquel

630
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Yeah maybe next year and then

631
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,136
And the best beer in America is Samuel Adams Boston Lager

632
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
And the whole company was to

633
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Pikachu and Rhonda

634
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah

635
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Do that mean you were profitable from

636
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
From the start

637
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
Yes we were profitable from the first

638
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Full month

639
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Because

640
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
Convectors talking about earlier

641
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
You know

642
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
It was the ultimate

643
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Lean

644
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Start up

645
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Like I said we had

646
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
No office

647
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
We didn't even have

648
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
A telephone we did all our business from

649
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
Payphones I knew where all the good payphones with embossed

650
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
We're the ones that were warm in the winter

651
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
The ones where you actually had a little

652
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Shelf or you could put stuff on

653
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
So

654
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
That was very

655
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Clear when I started

656
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
It's just very clear to me that way

657
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
Only two things that we needed

658
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
To do

659
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Really well

660
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
We needed

661
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
To make

662
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Great beer

663
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Consist

664
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
And we needed to work our butts off to

665
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,736
To sell it at the beginning this was like a a regional thing like Justin

666
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
In Boston in

667
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Yeah

668
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
So how did you get it to

669
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Spread across the country

670
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
It happened very slowly

671
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
You know it

672
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Basically

673
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
Started in Boston

674
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
I sort of

675
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
Grew a little bit out of Boston and

676
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,912
Went to Worcester I was doing a lot of the selling myself

677
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
So

678
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
One bar

679
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
At a time

680
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
And a lot of work a lot of shoe leather

681
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
A lot of Motel sixes

682
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
So I think

683
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
The first city out of

684
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,760
Add a New England was Washington so I would go down to Washington

685
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Down here I'm going to

686
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
I still know

687
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
A lot of the bar owners here I sit at bar

688
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,304
Before I came over here the Irish Times yeah famous Barnard one of my first

689
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Account

690
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
And

691
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Was talking to Brandon the current owner

692
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
But his dad

693
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
Put Sam Adams

694
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
In there

695
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
Almost 30 years ago

696
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
So

697
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
You know was very hard in the beginning getting places

698
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Just to carry it and probably got

699
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
You're 95%

700
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
Rejection so I make 20 calls to get

701
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
One account

702
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
And

703
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Then we got picked as the best beer in the mirror

704
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
Yeah we got a bunch of publicity around

705
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
That people

706
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
People magazine to the story

707
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Which was good and bad

708
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Cuz

709
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
All that publicity boost

710
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,608
Did the salesman we ran out of beer you could not make it fast will it take 6 weeks

711
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
To make Sam Adams and we weren't expecting it

712
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
So we're out of beer for 3 weeks

713
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
We lost a bunch of

714
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Piss people off

715
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
But it was clear there was

716
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,384
This idea was a bigger idea than I had

717
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Did this wasn't going to

718
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
Go Take 5 years to get to $1000000

719
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
That way

720
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
A million bucks it'll be great

721
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
I'll be happy life

722
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Yes exactly

723
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
And by the way

724
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
5 months

725
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
I remember

726
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
Sitting at a bar with Rhonda

727
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,424
And running we had business plan

728
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
But

729
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,264
Something's telling me this is bigger than we thought

730
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Going to be

731
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
That

732
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
We are climbing a mountain

733
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Here

734
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
And

735
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
Nobody climbs a mountain to get to the middle

736
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
We're going to climb this mountain to get to the top

737
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
And

738
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,720
It may take 30 years may take 50 years and

739
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Our mountain is

740
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
I want

741
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Sam Adams to be

742
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
The largest and most respected of the high-end beers

743
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
In the United States

744
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
That's our Mountain

745
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Remember

746
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Part of your strategy at scenes

747
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Was like attacking it

748
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
Those imported beers that are member

749
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Hearing a radio ads

750
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Can you do

751
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
In the 90s were you taking

752
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
Declare your independence from foreign beer

753
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
The radio spot came about because there was radio station in Boston

754
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
Then they want a beer for a party

755
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
And so we traded him beer

756
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Prayer time

757
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,216
Now they gave us air time at 2 in the morning

758
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Thinking

759
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
Who would want that to me

760
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
I thought that was great because

761
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
That's when

762
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
The servers

763
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
In the bartenders

764
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,528
Get off the shed that's when they're so they gave me all this airtime

765
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
And

766
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,136
At first was going to like get radio tallinn

767
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
Tell record it and then I found out well

768
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
You can hire that but

769
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,096
Yeah there's all these Union rules and you have to pay residuals you got to track it

770
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
I can't do that

771
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
I'll do the spots

772
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Myself

773
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
So my spot was

774
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
When America asked

775
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
For your abs

776
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Tired in pool

777
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
We didn't mean there beer

778
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
But the beer they send us

779
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
This is hardly their best

780
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,272
They send us Heineken outlawed in Germany

781
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Because of Germany strict

782
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Beer Purity law

783
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Edit

784
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,464
The backstage send us isn't the same backs they have in Germany

785
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
They had forbidden adjuncts

786
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
To it

787
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
That

788
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Was Beth

789
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
The company threatened with the litigation oh yes

790
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
But I knew I was right

791
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,288
They're having a brewing background they knew it and

792
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
You could also tell it on analysis

793
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
My feelings always been

794
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
If you're right about something important

795
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,552
Push it

796
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Tok so after I guess

797
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Like about a decade

798
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,184
After you launch you decide to go public

799
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
What happened watch it YG

800
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
You decide to do that

801
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Welp

802
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
I thought it was time

803
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
To do something to

804
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,424
Reward my investors because at that time I think

805
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
A dollar

806
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Invested

807
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
Was probably worth $400

808
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
So I went to a couple investment Banks they described the IPO process

809
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
But when they describe it to you

810
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
You realize

811
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
That there's nothing public

812
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
At all about it's all for their buddy it is all for their buddies at

813
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
The big institutions

814
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
To buy the shares

815
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
And make a bunch of money in

816
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
That bothered me and I thought

817
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
I got to find a way around that

818
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
So I started thinking about it

819
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
And I came up with

820
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Idea

821
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
So we put coupons on the six pack

822
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
That allowed you

823
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
To buy 33 shares

824
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Boston Beer Company

825
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,176
At $15 a share so was born at $95

826
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
What you said to send in a check

827
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
And

828
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
The investment Banks freaked out about it

829
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:44,416
They told me you can't do it it'll never work they give me all these reasons not to but

830
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
I stood my ground

831
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
I was insistent and I knew

832
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
The investment Banks

833
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Make money on this

834
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
So they will let me do it

835
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
If I refused

836
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Compromise

837
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
So I refuse to compromise

838
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Eventually they all came around

839
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
And

840
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
We got a hundred and thirty some thousand people

841
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Offset

842
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
NHL

843
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
We got

844
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
65 million dollars

845
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
That was the first time

846
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Something like that

847
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
Had been done and other people

848
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Have

849
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
Continue to do it followed up on it

850
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
So earlier you said that you want

851
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
Salmon recipes

852
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Largest and most respected

853
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
Of the cortical high-end beers in the US

854
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Do you think you would

855
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
This may sound

856
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Surprising but

857
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
I still don't feel like we're there and

858
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
Yeah but I got to give you some perspective of what do you think our Market

859
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Sharon United

860
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Pain 13%

861
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
Yeah that's what everybody thinks

862
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
A little over 1%

863
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
So the big Brewers

864
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Fillmore beer

865
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Then I make all year long

866
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
Yeah 90% of the US Beer Market is in the hands of

867
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
2

868
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Big

869
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Global

870
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Brewing conglomerate

871
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
You're not like a small company

872
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
How many points do you guys have now

873
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
I'm weak. A little over 1400

874
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
People that's

875
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
To me also

876
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Really

877
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Gratifying because

878
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
The average

879
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
W2 compensation

880
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
$70,000

881
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
So there

882
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
You know they are good jobs

883
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
Atterbury those are Manufacturing

884
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
Good-paying manufacturing jobs

885
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
In communities

886
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
All across the United

887
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
States

888
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
When you think about

889
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
How you built the company and and

890
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
And Sam Adams and

891
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
And how much of it do you think was

892
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
You're skilled in your intelligence

893
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
And talent and how much of it was

894
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Guy

895
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
I'll take the lock

896
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
So

897
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:47,296
It all humility a lot of it was like I look back and things could have gone wrong you know that

898
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Brew Kettle code of ethics

899
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Exploded

900
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Or

901
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Yeah that first guy could have told me

902
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
Is a really stupid idea go back to your

903
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
Job

904
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
You know a lot of things

905
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,352
Didn't go wrong that they could have

906
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Did you

907
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Could you have ever imagined that

908
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
Craft beer in America

909
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Would become what it

910
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
What if

911
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
I never

912
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
Imagine

913
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408

Unable to have

917
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
And I never

918
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Imagine that there would be

919
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
4500

920
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Other

921

Their own

924
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Success

925
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Today

926
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
American Beer

927
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
Has gone from the laughing stock that it was

928
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
When I started

929
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
2

930
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
The best place

931
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
In the world to be a Beer Drinker

932
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
And when the rest of the world

933
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
They're looking at the US

934
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,408
I wish we could do in our country

935
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,248
What Americans have done with beer I wish we had the beer culture

936
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
That America has

937
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
You know

938
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
Which makes me feel good

939
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Every time I have a beer

940
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,768

00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
