ASAP

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
So here's a question

23
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
Have you ever wondered why the list is spelled with a y

24
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,592
Instead of an eye

25
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
I was really trying to grab

26
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Attention

27
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Company

28
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
Trying to solve a problem which you will hear about in this episode

29
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,320
Which first ran last February and

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
One of the kind of funny things we had to figure out was how to quickly Market to the

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
College campus

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Whatever early purchases was

33
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
A frog and beaver costume that we put on I went to Cornell I was actually going to Corner

34
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,920
On a recruiting trip for Lehman

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
And

36
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
I was standing

37
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
On the quad in this ridiculous costume handing out cards about this carpooling service is a frog

38
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
Beaver costume beaver

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,792
And at the next day at the Lehman recruiting event

40
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
A girl came up to me and said

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
I see you in a in a beaver costume yesterday

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Ramen.

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
How I built this innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind them

44
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Gyros

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
How did John Zimmer made private cars work like taxis and in the process helps build a service

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Hours billions

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
So did you actually remember the

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
The days of walking onto

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
The sidewalk

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Hand

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Inhaling

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Hey Taxi

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
I mean

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
It feels like ancient history right but still

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Even though this world

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Car rides

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
A few years old

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
We're so used to it that

59
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
If you like me

60
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Answer youth anxious when the Uber or Lyft app says you have to wait for 3 minutes for your ride and just think about how

61
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Weekly ride-sharing apps

62
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
Like uber and Lyft

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,312
Totally transformed transportation in many cities around the world have

64
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
In most places

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,992
They've become indispensable which has also meant that the competition between the two companies

66
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,368
Has been really Fierce since 2012 when both of them launched the service

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:11,744
It turned private cars into public taxis but the amazing thing is is

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
Even though Lyft is just a fraction the size of uber

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
It is still valued at more than 5

70
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Billion dollars

71
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
And one of the guys behind it John Zimmer

72
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,616
He never thought that ride-sharing would be his life's work he actually studied hotel management

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Cornell

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
What is interest

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Restart

76
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
How to change during his senior year

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:38,880
I took a course that was really really important to me called Green cities that I had this amazing

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Professor

79
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,488
His first lecture is the history of the world in 30 minutes kind of like

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
The book Guns germs

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
And

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
He ended the lecture saying that we're at a really important time in world

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
World history where population density is rising rapidly in our cities as more people move there

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
And resources

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
And infrastructures

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
That were built decades ago

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Are becoming more and more strength

88
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,296
And he kind of challenges stand in the class and said if you don't make this class

89
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Mosto

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Something you do this

91
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Then I don't want to teach

92
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Because if we don't fix

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
These problems

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
We're going to have major economic

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Environment

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
And social problems

97
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
And that kind of set me on a path

98
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Which eventually led to lift

99
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
But being that I grew up

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
In the east coast and in Connecticut and New York

101
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,311
I did feel like I had to have a finance experience in

102
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
So

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
After graduating I went and worked

104
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
At Lehman Brothers

105
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Hi in mm

106
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Wow

107
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Lehman Brothers in 2006

108
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Like when we look back on that and

109
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Roof

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
I was like hell yeah you know

111
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
The decline and fall right there so you go to Lehman Brothers

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
In 2006 What will what did you do there

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
I was doing real estate Finance

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
So I was right in the heart

115
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Where everything happen

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
And as you said right at that moment

117
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
2006

118
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Text to 2008 was my 2-year analyst

119
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Was it interesting

120
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
It was interesting for a few months

121
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
But I got to say I

122
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
My interest declined

123
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Probably after

124
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Just about a year

125
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
And so I started thinking

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
What what else I could do

127
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,903
It was actually about about a year into it that I was on Facebook one night

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
And

129
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Saw

130
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,767
Logan who is now my co-founder who I didn't know at the time

131
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Posted

132
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,887
On a mutual friend's Facebook page saying that he was starting a website

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Call zimride

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
And what like what

135
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Was Elizabeth

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
What was the story so Logan's background

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Is that he

138
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Grew up in LA

139
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Hitting traffic

140
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
He then went to UC Santa Barbara and made an experiment of himself so he can bring a car to school

141
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
And wanted to see how he

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
We could survive without a car

143
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,879
And he started a car share program similar to Zipcar first

144
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Beijing University

145
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
City fleet vehicles

146
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
And he got the attention of the local Transit

147
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
The local Transit board

148
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
Elected him as the youngest member ever to be on this Transit boarding

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
Logan Brandon in Santa Barbara

150
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
In Santa Barbara

151
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
And he quickly grew to realize

152
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
The challenges

153
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
In public trans

154
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Invitation

155
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
And came to the conclusion that

156
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Across the country

157
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
When you pay to get on the bus

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
You really only covering about 34

159
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
So what that means is that $3 bus for actually cost

160
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
The government 10

161
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
And

162
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
As the lines get more busy

163
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
They get harder

164
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Dafont

165
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
And harder to add service.

166
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Also they actually

167
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
The more busy they got the worst

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
So he came to the conclusion that public transportation

169
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Broken

170
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
And while the promise of

171
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Public transit

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Phenomenal

173
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
The reality was

174
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
It's not and so

175
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
He then traveled to

176
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Zimbabwe

177
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Where he saw people

178
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Sharing rides out of necessity

179
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
And got inspired

180
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
To build

181
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
A website

182
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
That would connect people

183
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,111
Going the same way to be able to sell it

184
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
In their car and that's why

185
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
He called the website

186
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
After Zimbabwe

187
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Yeah

188
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
So Logan was basically trying to build a website

189
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
That was like

190
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Hey I'm going this way I look

191
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
The car Shine website

192
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
What used to be that you just advertising

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Like Craigslist

194
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
The store puts on a pinboard in

195
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
On college campuses

196
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Saying driving from yuan

197
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
LA to San Francisco

198
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Do you need a ride

199
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
But he was basically trying to

200
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Concept

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
And put it online

202
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Exactly yeah it so

203
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Like you said we had these

204
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Physical bulletin boards

205
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Azure digital bullets

206
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Turn boards

207
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Four people going along the sea

208
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Same way if they're going

209
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Spring break or fall

210
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Call break

211
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
But there was no identity

212
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Or ratings

213
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Behind that and so it was limited in how many

214
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
People actually

215
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
And so we thought how can we make a safe

216
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
If you tied something

217
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Facebook

218
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
You can have a profile of the individual you're going to

219
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Share ride with

220
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
And follow up with ratings

221
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Of of how that ride experience

222
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
It was

223
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
At which would create a safer and more broadly

224
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Used environment

225
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
For for carpooling on College camp

226
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
So what

227
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
Happens to you guys then look at this stage

228
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
You and Logan still have met right so do you

229
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Email a mortgage

230
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Did you call Amber what

231
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
So we got on a

232
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,823
Call I believe in and he said that he was actually going to be

233
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
In New York City

234
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
In a few weeks

235
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
And so we ended up meeting up

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
And talking a lot about about carpooling and and I shared

237
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
Some of the thoughts that I had from that course I

238
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Cornell

239
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
We realized that we were

240
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Both so passionate

241
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
About solving the same problem

242
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
And Ambien work

243
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Come together right after that

244
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
New York and did you guys just hit each other

245
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,983
Yeah yeah he's become my best friend he was best man at my wedding

246
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
He's also a very

247
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Focused

248
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Calm and thoughtful

249
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Pearson this is funny story when he

250
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
He was a kid I think he was about

251
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
8 years old

252
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
His parents had had just got

253
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
The TV and

254
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
I guess

255
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
A few weeks later

256
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
He said

257
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
He asked his parents

258
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
How to remove the TV for

259
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
From the house because

260
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Distracting

261
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
So I think that just speaks to his

262
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Is level of focus and

263
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
I really enjoyed

264
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
That working with him because of that that book passion

265
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
At focus and thoughtfulness

266
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
Okay so you guys start working on zimride together

267
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,967
You're still at Liam Brothers right right and what was its Logan doing at this point

268
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
So

269
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,831
He's at UC Santa Barbara sustainability coordinator after he's graduated

270
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
He's working on zimride

271
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
The side project project he actually did

272
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
A lot of the original coding

273
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
The website

274
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
And

275
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
We didn't know whether it was a

276
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Big business

277
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Retarded

278
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Could be

279
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
But before we were going to jump all the way and we wanted to start

280
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
So we spent

281
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Nights and weekends

282
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Working on

283
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Zimride

284
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
Just like remotely you were in New York and he was in Santa Barbara and you would

285
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Like emailing and

286
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Skyping and stuff all the time

287
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Yeah yeah we have

288
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Late night sky band

289
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
Every maybe month or two we try to get together

290
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
And

291
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,559
Logan's on he's working on building the website on my end I'm figuring out how do we get enough

292
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
People using the platform

293
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
So that it works it was really like a chicken or egg problem

294
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Where

295
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
The idea

296
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Of having

297
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
A lot of seats

298
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
To choose from on your way home

299
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Say Cornell in

300
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
New York to go to New York City with

301
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Exciting

302
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Yeah there is

303
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Very few bus routes

304
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Not everyone on the car

305
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Or had a car on campus and so

306
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
If I could go on

307
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Zimride Cornell Edition

308
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
And by seeing someone else

309
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
What is Carrefour

310
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
$20

311
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
$30

312
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
That would be really exciting but

313
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Had to be there had to

314
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
To be available we had to create both sides

315
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
The marketplace

316
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
So the idea was

317
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
How Facebook originally

318
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Coupons to 12

319
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
You would just have these sites at University so

320
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
The students can figure out

321
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Exactly

322
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
And so

323
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
One of the kind of funny things

324
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
We had to figure out was

325
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
Was how to quickly

326
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Market

327
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
To the college camp

328
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Just kind of strange we wanted to put on

329
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Costumes on campus

330
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
And hand out information about this survey

331
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Whatever early purchases was

332
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
A frog and beaver costume that we

333
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,703
Put on I went to Cornell I was actually going to Cornell

334
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
On a recruiting trip for Lehman

335
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
But I went a few days early

336
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
And

337
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
I was standing

338
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
On the Clyde

339
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:34,527
In this ridiculous costume handing out cards about this carpal and service dog costume with Beaver costume

340
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,879
I was the beaver out flyers

341
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Yasso

342
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,511
We needed to get a critical mass of let's call it a thousand people

343
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,399
The offering their seat so that those that went on to look for a seat could find one and it worked

344
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
And

345
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
At the next day at the Lehman recruiting event

346
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
A girl came up to me

347
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Love surrounded by a lot of

348
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Managing directors in

349
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
Did I see you in a in a beaver costume yesterday

350
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,879
You know the next step was let's sell a private Network

351
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
To the various University

352
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
And that we were able to over a few year. Sell to 150 universities and

353
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Companies that would pay us

354
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
An annual fee for this private car

355
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
So you were not

356
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
You weren't taking a cut off the

357
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
I got the feeling that people would charge

358
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Share ride

359
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Accurate

360
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Not at not at that time

361
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
YouTube the business model was a cell this University is a

362
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Subscription model

363
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:43,903
And you fold a hundred to go see you were personally calling universities and pitching us to them

364
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,255
Yeah so I was personally calling and traveling to

365
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
Probably visited hundreds of universities

366
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
In in those first few years how did you do this

367
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
In the beginning and work at Lehman Brothers

368
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
In the first year is more about

369
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Getting the product stood up and having a proof

370
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Not being kind of Cornell and so

371
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
The majority

372
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
Virtually all of those sales came once

373
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Once I went full-time

374
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
10 mm

375
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
You would like to know what Imma do that smile leave Lena brother

376
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,999
Yes it was early 2008 and I made the decision and

377
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,375
At my best friend's mother actually worked in the same building as me when I was at Lehman Brothers

378
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
I told her what I wanted to do and she said

379
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,031
How could you leave a Shore thing like lemon to do a Crazy Cart

380
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,895
How many people have brothers

381
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Yeah

382
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
To go do something

383
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Yes at several people said that to me

384
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
And then three months later

385
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Lehman was bankrupt

386
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
We knew that there were

387
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
Challenges going on at Lehman but I could not have predicted that

388
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
3 months later

389
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
That they would have been Bank

390
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
So you moved

391
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
To Silicon Valley Inn

392
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
2008 to go full-time

393
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
I'm zimride with Logan green

394
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Yes

395
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Did zimride get become profitable

396
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Yep

397
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Hugely profitable or respectable

398
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
I'd say respectively profit

399
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
Who was a pretty robust company in

400
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Did you see this as

401
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,183
This was going to be your thing this is what you were going to do with your life

402
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,023
Yeah I mean the dream was to start

403
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
A business that had a major

404
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
An important impact

405
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
On our world and specifically on the way that our cities are designed

406
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
And so

407
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
You know I think from an early. We consider this

408
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Our life's work

409
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,175
When you were going to basically transform carpal you were going to do

410
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
For carpooling Starwood Airbnb stand for

411
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Accommodate

412
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,855
Exactly

413
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
So what happened how did you shift

414
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,767
From like this concept of carpooling to what would eventually become

415
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Left

416
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
So in the middle of 2012

417
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
4 years in

418
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Yeah about 4 years of doing it

419
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Full-time

420
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,799
And and we stop and look at ourselves and say

421
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
How are things going

422
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
And what would we do

423
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
If we were starting over.

424
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
I think that's a really helpful exercise

425
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
And

426
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
What was true

427
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
In 2012 that was not

428
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
When we started was the proliferation of

429
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Smartphones

430
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
And operating

431
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
That would enable

432
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
More

433
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Short-term planning

434
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
And short disk

435
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
It was him ride you had to go on a website and

436
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Find the days and the person going right and you had to

437
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
So do it I guess

438
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
At least today in the van

439
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Exactly yeah it so once the technology shift

440
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Did that would enable more in

441
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Decision making the hopper

442
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Are our thought process shift

443
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
And

444
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
You guys start to think

445
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Maybe we should focus on Sunday

446
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Yes so weird scene

447
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Uber had started

448
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Limos

449
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
On demand

450
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
The black

451
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Yeah and we said you know that

452
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Interesting from a

453
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
You know using

454
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Mobile technology

455
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,543
But it wasn't that interesting to us from

456
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
You're picking

457
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
In a small population of

458
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
People that can

459
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
4 right out of a private driver

460
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
Because Yuri was like a an elite service

461
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
Set the beginning it was just has black cars and it was from their craft fancy

462
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeso

463
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
The average American household spends

464
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Over $9,000

465
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Every year on owning and operating a

466
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Car

467
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Equates to over 2 trillion dollars

468
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Annually

469
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
In the US

470
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
In the car seat

471
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Part 96

472
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Percent of the time

473
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
And so we said

474
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
How could we

475
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
Take these personal vehicle

476
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
That are parked at altar

477
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
And expensive

478
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
To their owners

479
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
And make better use of

480
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
And and so the idea was

481
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
How to create an app

482
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Where you could you

483
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
You could request

484
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Someone

485
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Personal View

486
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
On demand

487
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
For the platform really is

488
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
At that point was just

489
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Hey I have a car sitting here and I'm going to make it available

490
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Rent out for an hour

491
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
No it was

492
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Hey I have a car and I have time

493
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
And I'm going to go drive

494
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Other people around Cry 4 for payment

495
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
And it goes back to that

496
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
My Hospitality experience of how do we create something

497
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
That was centered around service about treating driver and passenger with respect

498
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,391
But also you got to remember what is now accepted as normal getting into someone else's vehicle

499
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Was not at all normal

500
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Right back

501
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
We had to

502
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Work to

503
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Change people

504
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Behavior and

505
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
In the early days suggesting

506
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Will sit up front

507
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
And in trading this

508
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
Your friend with a car hot Hospitality environment

509
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
We felt that one it opens the audience

510
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
To a larger set of

511
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
Drivers and if you go in a room of our

512
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
A hundred of our friends and you ask how many of you are willing to drive a taxi

513
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
A couple handmade

514
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Baby go up

515
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
When you say how many of you are willing to share a ride

516
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
You know 75

517
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Hands would go up

518
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
And so

519
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
We wanted to create the experience around that

520
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
That because

521
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
After

522
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Many many years

523
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Of being

524
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
I told not to do

525
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
And many many years of seeing

526
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Yellow

527
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Vehicle

528
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
And thinking that that is safe to

529
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Because it's yellow

530
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
We had a lot of

531
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,991
In a behavior change to the kind of push through

532
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
John Zimmer co-founder of Lyft

533
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575

555

It's how I built this from NPR

556
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Gyros

557
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
So it's 2012

558
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,623
And John and Logan were still working on this carpool concept called zimride and they were doing pretty well they pitched

559
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,207
A bunch of investors in Silicon Valley they got some money

560
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,327
But around this time they decided to change course and focus on other ways

561
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
They can make car sharing

562
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Accessible to Millions

563
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Basically an early version of what

564
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Eventually would become Lyft

565
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
The before they could really launch the app

566
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
They needed

567
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Test it out so

568
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
I got in touch with him

569
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,503
So the first set of of drivers we actually

570
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
Emailed a bunch of zimride

571
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Users

572
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
And

573
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
That we said hey we have this new project we're trying out

574
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,999
And that we love you to try it out

575
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Then we invited them over to the office and walked

576
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
True kind of the whole

577
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Experience

578
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
That that we were they were all in in the San Francisco area

579
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Yes

580
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
And what did you

581
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
You tell him to do today

582
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Drive around the city

583
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,407
Well we we first got to walk through how the

584
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
Hopworks are all the safety standards that we had

585
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
And we let them know that

586
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
What what's going to happen is that you're going to get a request

587
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
On your phone and it's going to let you know where that that passenger is

588
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
That they could go pick up that passenger

589
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Take them where they needed

590
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
And that the op what kind of help help them

591
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Navigate

592
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
And do do all those

593
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Pick-up and drop-off

594
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
And at the time

595
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
There was a suggested donation at the end of the ride

596
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
At the passenger can make

597
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Through their credit card that was

598
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Attached to their Pro

599
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Going to be

600
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Free if you want

601
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
To be free

602
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
It was an early days you got to remember again one that this was

603
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
Was very very new and not normal and

604
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,720
United was fault would fall in a regulatory gray area

605
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
And so one of the ways

606
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,328
That we we we saw around that was to say

607
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,424
Kit to make it optional for payment in the early days until we had

608
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
@ford through

609
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
The the right regulatory structure

610
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
At what point did

611
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Did you come up with that

612
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
When did it go from

613
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
From being called zimrides

614
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Before we launched it

615
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
At the working title was in Wright insta

616
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
But while going through

617
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Actually really

618
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
3 week. That

619
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
Lyft app the original Lyft app was built it was

620
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Is very very fat

621
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
And the brand

622
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Lyft

623
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
Was thought of during that period as well along with

624
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
With the logo and everything

625
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Thanks

626
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
Except you couldn't get LIF

627
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
That was probably take

628
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
Yeah lafc.com is owned by Otis Elevator

629
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
Okay fair enough yeah right

630
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
So you got Lya

631
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
Yeah in the middle of 2012

632
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
Again over 3 weeks.

633
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
The team movie

634
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Incredibly fast 2

635
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Build the app

636
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Come up with the branding

637
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
And meat

638
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
And background check and I'm bored

639
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,048
The first set of drivers and then we then we invited a few friends and

640
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,608
It was that we got an incredible response

641
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
So this is only in San Francisco at this point right

642
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Yes

643
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
How long did it take before

644
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,592
You know you open this up you made this into a decimal

645
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Anybody could use

646
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,944
It was probably the second half of 2012

647
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Where are we

648
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
It started to take off

649
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,112
We started to divert resources from zimride over to lift

650
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
And I'm really in in January of 2013

651
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
We said

652
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
Okay we need to go all in

653
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
This is

654
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
A massive opportunity

655
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
This has been incredibly successful

656
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
With a small amount of focus

657
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
But that was a really

658
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
In many ways a tough moment because we had work

659
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
4

660
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
You're for five years on zimride

661
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
And we were deciding to divert all of our attention

662
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
To an entirely new model see you guys

663
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Sold

664
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Exactly so we sold them right to Enterprise rent

665
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
The car

666
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
And basically did the assets

667
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Add a contract with the universities

668
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
And retained the entire team

669
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
And went all-in on unless

670
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
So that first-year how many people downloaded the app

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
That's just tens of thousands

672
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
And you guys are your model as you were taking a cut out of

673
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Every

674
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Right right

675
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
To the the rate is calculated

676
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
FaceTime

677
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
At distance

678
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Sometime and then left at receiver

679
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
A commission off of that one

680
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
20 to 25%

681
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
I offer the overall rate the rest goes to the driver

682
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
As well as a

683
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Trust

684
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Conservice fee

685
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
So when you start this right

686
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,168
Did you I mean now we look back and say oh yeah

687
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
Of course this is going to work but presumably like you started

688
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
The face a lot of backlash

689
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Obstacles from City

690
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
He said had

691
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Pretty entrenched

692
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,408
Taxicab commissions and drivers and

693
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Established

694
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,016
Regulations about who can pick people up and drive them for money

695
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Yasso

696
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
About a month into launching left this was

697
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Later

698
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
At 2012

699
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
Received our first of many cease and desist

700
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Not from various different governments

701
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
And

702
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
It basically said you need to stop by

703
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
And what did you do

704
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
We read the letter and then we had already done our

705
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Like working

706
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Research on the laws and and we asked for meeting

707
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
I think I was followed by a second season to Sis but we eventually got

708
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
A meeting with with who

709
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
With the Public Utilities Commission

710
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
Okay and our approach to regulations is to to really understand

711
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
The motivations and the needs of

712
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Of the regulating entity

713
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
Because we understand they have a very important job

714
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
And we went in and asked that we said hit Locker

715
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,424
Is this a matter in a public safety

716
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Or is this about you know existing Industries

717
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:52,128
Anderson Public Safety of course until we said we don't own Vehicles we don't have employees driving for us

718
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
So we don't fall into

719
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
The category that you currently have

720
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,552
But we looked at your safety regulation since that's the most of

721
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Important thing

722
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
And

723
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,160
We've gone above and beyond on a background check

724
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
Actually still to this day for

725
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Limos in in

726
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
In California are not required

727
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
We've done

728
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
Driving record Texas

729
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Whitmore Street

730
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Period and we create an insurance policy

731
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
But the million dollars and there's

732
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Isn't was 700

733
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
$50,000

734
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
If it's about safety

735
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
What we'd love to do with you to create a new category

736
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
.

737
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Allows you to

738
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
Enforce that we are doing these things that we tell you we were doing

739
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
But that we were able to do this in

740
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
In a safe

741
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
That way that brings more affordable transfer

742
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Irritation to

743
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
California

744
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
They were threatening to sue you

745
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
They were threatening to shut us down

746
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
Force against the drivers that we're driving in

747
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
Were you scared about that possibility

748
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,800
Yes cuz you'd sold of zimride and she put all your eggs in this basket and

749
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
It could have been shut down

750
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
Yeah I think I literally had a headache for 1 month

751
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
I wish I had to go

752
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,784
Check and make sure nothing was wrong but it was incredibly stressful

753
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
What time

754
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
Because as you said we switched

755
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
All of our Focus over to from zimride to Lyft

756
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
And at the opportunity was massive and the regulatory obstacles that we're just

757
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,912
What does massive how long does it take for you to overcome

758
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Those initial

759
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
Regulatory challenges like was months years it's at least at least

760
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:32,736
Year early for that first year if I was to pick the one thing I spent most of my time on

761
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:38,880
Was the government relations and was working to create a new regulatory category 4 for the space

762
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,976
And then you know not just doing that in one state

763
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632
But being able to demonstrate that in in multiple cities and states

764
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
So when so when you start

765
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
To expand outside of San Francisco and then La how fast were you expanding to other cities is it like every month every

766
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Everyday every week

767
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,552
That kind of earlier. It was more

768
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
Every few months

769
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Maybe the most

770
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Intense moment was

771
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
April

772
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
24

773
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
2014 when we launched 24 markets on the same day

774
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Who are your competitors

775
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Is Uber was still doing

776
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Let me buy car

777
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
Yeah there really wasn't

778
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,312
There's some other companies that were trying in this in this kind of

779
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Peer-to-peer

780
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Personal vehicle space

781
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,712
But they're there wasn't a large amount of competition

782
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
There were still so many questions looming around regulatory

783
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,416
That I think knew people were waiting back to see how that played up

784
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Your focus was on

785
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
This

786
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Airbnb bottle

787
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Or you got a car

788
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
And

789
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
It's going to be community and

790
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Sharing-economy thing like

791
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
What happened when when all the sudden Uber

792
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Started doing Uber

793
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Where they base

794
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Copied remodel

795
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
Yes so I mean we we assume that

796
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
Because the opportunity was so large and everything we're seeing that there would be more

797
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
More competition coming

798
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
And so it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a big surprise

799
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
And

800
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
It just you I think over the

801
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
The course of the diffuser years we've been doing this it's

802
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,352
It made us better and frankly I think both both companies grow fast

803
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
How do you differentiate

804
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,240
Yourself from them like how do you make the case that actually you should go with us and not bad

805
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
Yes so are our focus in the early days was we needed to

806
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
Ensure we solved the two most important things for our customers first which was not reliability you can get a

807
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
Ride when you want it at the best possible

808
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,672
Once you have parody on those and now it now we do we built up

809
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Enough infrastructure

810
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,328
Enough basic driver community that you can get a ride with in an average 3 minutes

811
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,424
In the cities then it's about the experience in today's world

812
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,800
By treating drivers better than any other company the ability to have cashless tips get

813
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Paid in the same day

814
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
Create an environment where drivers are respected by passengers and nuts and translates to passengers be

815
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Being treated better

816
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,880
Then another service are you a competitive person like to you

817
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
Do you look at your competition and really one

818
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Want to beat them

819
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes absolutely

820
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
How much is a drive you

821
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
That idea

822
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:32,192
Auditor to a large degree I used to play sports

823
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
Whether it was running track or playing soccer

824
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
And you know I started running track as

825
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
Just to stay in shape for soccer and then

826
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
I wanted to

827
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
To win the race and I wanted to

828
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Go under 5 minute mile

829
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
And was able to

830
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,320
To do that and so I think often now today

831
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
You know where it where in

832
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,672
Hello what could be described as a mile

833
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Four laps

834
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
And where in lab 2

835
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
You know that 3 is typically in that race the most critical.

836
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
Were you set yourself up for victory and so

837
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:08,032
I think we're making a lot of important moves and decisions now that should allow us to

838
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
To win the race

839
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
To take it personally like you know

840
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
Uber obviously has

841
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,968
Okanogan a pretty tough competitor in a X or Ben

842
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
Accusations at the

843
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
That they've

844
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
How to sabotage you or maybe you guys have

845
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Dongzhimen

846
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,928
Is it is a personal 2D is it something that you really

847
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Feel emotionally

848
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
Yeah yeah definitely

849
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
And I mean

850
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
Is part of it well just is it just business in

851
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Business

852
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,192
Days where you can how you hate your

853
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,080
Competitor but you all still respect them or is it really like no actually this is really personal I don't like them

854
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:47,456
I think we take it and I take it personally which drives me

855
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,808
Because I believe so strongly in what our team is working on and why were were

856
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
We believe that

857
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
By building what we're building we can make our cities

858
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Designed around

859
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
People instead of cars

860
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
And by having the right values

861
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
An ethics

862
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,424
We can impact Society in a way that's bigger than a transfer

863
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Rotation week

864
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
And so

865
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
I take it personally

866
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Because

867
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
We're out to win for the values that we represent

868
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
I don't let that distract me

869
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
I let that you know fuel the fire

870
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
And

871
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,272
I think in the early days

872
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
When I was less mature

873
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
It would it would distract

874
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
But

875
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
But today I feel

876
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Think it it just feels

877
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
The desire to

878
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Push harder

879
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Santa company there's

880
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
About 1300 people

881
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,472
And then drivers do you to disclose that number

882
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,056
I know we've said several months ago that

883
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,616
In the last year there was over 300,000 and

884
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
And you can assume that this year

885
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Have that number has grown quite significant

886
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Do we think about like these right trying

887
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Companies

888
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Uber and left

889
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
As

890
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,952
The stainless permitting that we all fall, depend on I got the apps of for both companies

891
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
Imyfone sorry I do have both

892
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
And

893
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
They become

894
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,656
Harbor Lights like there's like I can't even remember what life was like before Lyft or Uber

895
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
And yet we have to imagine Monday

896
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,104
Something is going to replace you guys and people think a driverless cars

897
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Do you ever think about that

898
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Sure I mean it's that

899
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:29,344
You know I I saw the rise and fall of Lehman right before my eyes and I think that that creates the

900
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
The right sense of

901
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Awareness and when building

902
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
A company that that you've seen something like that

903
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,792
But when you look at the future

904
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Are you talk about autonomous

905
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Cars

906
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,168
An autonomous car is not going to drop out of the sky and be able to do a hun

907
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
That's not real

908
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
What's real is that

909
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Over the next

910
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Couple years it'll be able to

911
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Do

912
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
A few percent of our trip

913
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
10% of our trips

914
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
50% of our trip

915
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
And

916
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
What that means for this opportunity is that

917
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,928
We're going to be able to address that ultimate goal we have of ending car ownership and providing a full out

918
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Alternative

919
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,512
To owning a car in fact what you'll be able to do

920
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Is by

921
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
Likely a miles plan from us

922
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Amethyst

923
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Description

924
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Hot to handle all your transportation

925
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,776
And over the next few years some of those trips will be done by

926
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,872
Human drivers in another's that will be done by autonomous vehicles

927
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
To the point that we can provide you with

928
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
Amazing

929
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,528
Hospitality experiences on wheels

930
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
Will you look back at you know

931
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
Packaging Logan over Facebook and then like

932
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,792
What kind of side project moving to Menlo Park Inn

933
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,120
Corn your heart and soul into the into zimride and

934
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,240
Then starting left and watching it turn into a company the value of its value over 5 billion dollars

935
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,568
Do you sort of look at that and sits or save yourself

936
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
Okay I can like breathe out a sigh of relief

937
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
We're okay we've made it we've gone week

938
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
We passed the hump

939
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
Or are you

940
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Corydon vigilant

941
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Everyday

942
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,624
Yeah. I don't think there's a acai of

943
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Accomplishment I think there is

944
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
The bar keeps getting raised

945
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
And that's the bar that

946
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
That we raised on ourselves

947
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
The goal over the last 10 years

948
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
For Logan I hasn't changed

949
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
You know it was them right

950
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
And then it was left

951
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
And then it will have

952
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Autonomous implication

953
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Until we've accomplished

954
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
The fact that you don't need to own a car in a city

955
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
Until we've accomplished the fact that we don't need

956
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
As many roads and parking lots

957
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
In our city

958
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
Until we allow for our cities to be

959
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,160
A redesigned around the people living in them instead of the

960
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
The cars

961
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
That are parked in them

962
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,608
Then we're not happy

963
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:55,008
John Zimmer co-founder of Lyft since we first ran this episode last February

964
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
Lyft valuation has more than doubled over 11 billion dollars

965
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,808
By the way or how I built this Summit in San Francisco on October

966

Built

975
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

976
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Time now for how you built that

977
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:13,600
And savory updated story we ran about a year ago this one comes from Kyle Ewing of Denver who got an idea for a

978
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,208
Business in kind of a roundabout way I got the idea when I was trying to

979
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,280
Create a product for students traveling abroad

980
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,120
This product was a backup copy of their passport

981
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
I was trying to sell backup passports online that would be as durable as the real thing

982
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
But also tear proof and waterproof

983
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,944
The problem was the market for this type of product doesn't yet exist

984
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,064
So I was trying to create the market which proved to be very difficult and I was trying to figure out what to

985
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,648
When the phone rang and the guy the phone

986
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,536
It was actually somebody who said hey Kyle I love your passport I even bought four of them for my kids

987
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,840
And he said all four of my daughters

988
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
Use the SOS world pass I love it

989
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,752
But I have a question for you can I buy a case of your paper and at that moment

990
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,360
Kyle realize that the waterproof paper he was using for the passports

991
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
Was actually a better business idea

992
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
Pain just the passports

993
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,784
That moment was me standing up out of my chair

994
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,184
And spiking the pencil and doing a touchdown dance because it was an immediate lightbulb moment where

995
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
I realized

996
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,512
This failing business just

997
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
Through legs and all of a sudden they had a million and one ideas of what I could use

998
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,448
Waterproof paper for and the bat is a pretty long list

999
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Waterproof

1000
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776
Restaurant menus waterproof children's books

1001
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Waterproof Maps field manuals for the u.s. Navy nautical charts for the u.s. connect to back up just a little

1002
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Kyle is not an engineer but

1003
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,856
He was working on the passport idea he made a bunch of calls to chemical expert said he told them

1004
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
He was looking to make

1005
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Paper that was totally waterproof

1006
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,024
Much more waterproof than say yeah just laminating something

1007
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,888
Zoe duration after iteration we finally got to paper that's both

1008
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:07,264
Waterproof and rip proof and something that can also receive and hold

1009
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
When it's been printed on eventually found a manufacturer in the US to make a polyester pulp that could be

1010
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,736
Depressed and rolled into waterproof paper

1011
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
Do you want to Tinker with a product himself so he moved a laser printer into his living room but

1012
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
When I put it through my home laser printer

1013
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Immediately

1014
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,888
White smoke came out of the printer and it smelled like burning plastic and the entire printer was

1015
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
After that Kyle's very supportive wife Ashley came home that night she smelled the burning smell and she's

1016
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,688
Said Kyle I love this arts and crafts project you taken on but I think it's time to get to a more realistic

1017
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:53,088
Take product or business idea but one printer and seven iterations later and Kyle says

1018
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:59,488
He came up with the most waterproof paper on the market and he has the clients to prove it including

1019
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
Yes the US Navy and airforce

1020
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,400
Several restaurant and hotel chains University Labs even Google

1021
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
Nekudot funeral days when you sit back

1022
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,520
You look at your sales or you look at the new client you just got

1023
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
And

1024
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
You think oh my gosh

1025
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
This is a real business

1026
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
I'm building something that matters

1027
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
And it actually is a success

1028
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,344
Since we last spoke with Kyle last year is revenue continues to grow he give us specifics but

1029
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
Paisa to say it is in the million it has a team of ten employees and his list of clay

1030
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,608
