Hey it's got here and today I'm super excited because

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
Very first episode

27
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:53,760
From the how I built this Summit that happened last month in San Francisco

28
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,368
And we asked a few entrepreneurs who we already interviewed on the show to come back

29
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
And talk more about how to build a business

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
Masterclass from the people who've been in the trenches

31
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,144
Today's episode is with Jennifer Hyman co-founder of the fashion brand Rent the Runway

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,264
And if you haven't heard Jen's original episode on the show or the story of Rent the Runway

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
I definitely recommend listening to that first but

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
He can't wait here's a brief sketch

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Came up with the idea for a company that would rent out designer clothes to women for special occasion

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Back when she started out she had to convince designers to get on board including the iconic designer Diane

37
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Von Furstenberg

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Janitor co-founder hustled their way into a meeting with Diane Lee cool to the idea

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,496
Actually Diane Von Furstenberg and hundreds of other designers sign on

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,616
In today Rent the Runway there's a hundred million dollars in annual revenue

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
And what lessons Jenn Hyman learned along the way

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272
How to introduce a disruptive idea

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,416
Is my conversation with Jenn Hyman in front of a live audience at the how I built this Summit

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Francisco

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
All right

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
So

47
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Something we didn't really get into the podcast episode was that you actually had a much bigger fully-formed idea cuz initially Rent the Runway

48
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Play was

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
A place you could go in and rent a fancy dress for a Gala for a ball or some kind of fancy

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
The event and that's what it was the beginning but you actually had the idea of what it would be fully formed in your mind already

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
At the beginning race

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
You're so I had this vision

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
In 2008.

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
The closet would move into

55
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
The cloud because

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
People were valuing it

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Experiences over ownership

58
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
And that there would be a time where a portion

59
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
Of what we wore every single day would be comprised of things that we don't own forever

60
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,360
So all rental meant to me is something that you didn't have to have a lifelong contract with

61
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
And that it could be a wardrobe on rotation

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
This Vision was Way Beyond

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Where

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,112
Consumer Behavior was at the time and certainly where investor Behavior was

65
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
So I had to

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Star

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
With a consumer value proposition that was more tangible

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
And that was easier to understand

69
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Which was

70
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Rent a dress for special occasion

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Because every woman has that exact

72
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Experience of opening up her closet

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
And seeing the closet filled with dead dresses

74
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
But she only wore one

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Because she was a bridesmaid or because she

76
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,736
You was pregnant or because something went out of style or she had a last-minute date

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
It popped up

78
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
It was very easy for

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
For people to wrap their arms around at the time

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Renting a dress

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Because most investors are mad

82
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
They were able to compare it to

83
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
To something they did

84
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
So I'm starting with

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
The most digestible piece

86
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Of the equation

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,824
Yeah I mean if you already had this idea in your mind you knew what the

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
The thing was going to be you had this vision

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
But you decide to take one small piece of it

90
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
And start

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
That way how did you know

92
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
When to start rolling out the other pieces

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Number one is

94
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
It was informed by when the customer was ready

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
And

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
There were two aspects

97
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Civ.

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Number one is when

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
The world around us had changed enough

100
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,983
We're people would consider renting their everyday clothing

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
And

102
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
We've been

103
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Able to

104
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
To grow not only because of the

105
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
The success of Rent the Runway

106
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
But also because of the sea

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Success of Airbnb

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
And Uber

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
And we were

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
And classpath

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
The million of

112
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,207
You know the many sharing economies that have impacted and transformed

113
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
How we act in every aspect

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
The Our Lives

115
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
But we also at the point that we

116
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Opened up a

117
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Subscription to Fashion we had millions of customers

118
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
At that point

119
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
Who had rented the runway for

120
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
A wedding your first special occasion had a great

121
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Experience

122
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
The behavior was more normalized at that point in time

123
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
And they were ready to try the neck

124
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Stop

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
And in fact when we spoke to our customers

126
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
They were begging us

127
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
2

128
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Offer them the ability to rent

129
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,815
To what they said was the most important occasion in their life and not occasion is work

130
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
We kept hearing from our customers

131
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
That the place where they want to feel the most self-confident the most empowered is when they walk into

132
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
The office every single day

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
They want to feel like a boss

134
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
They want to dress for the job they want

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
And there is this pink tax

136
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
It has existed

137
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Forever on women

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
Where there's an expectation that you're going to have Variety in your professional wardrobe

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
That you're going to

140
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
Be spending a lot of money to look presentable even when you

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
You can't afford

142
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
To actually

143
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
Pay for those items

144
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
So that this was a real

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
Need that the customer had show me you you have this you knew that this was going to be the thing you were going to do

146
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Do this what you waited for your customers to say we want this now we want to go and then you said okay we can go to face

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Ways to now we can push this button

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Yeah in fact it was always part of our early investor decks and presentations there's always the last

149
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Page of like what are you going to do in the future

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,767
I think a lot of investors discount that because it's

151
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
The page where

152
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
The entrepreneur says we're going to take over the world

153
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
Where did I come to trillion dollar company

154
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
But I was convinced

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
That we can build

156
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,823
The closet in the cloud that puts that 80% of the closet on rotation

157
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
And gives you a better way

158
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,479
The other thing that was critical about breaking up the idea into

159
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Two stages

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Was that

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
To be a successful entrepreneur

162
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,207
You not only have to have a customer value proposition but you have to have an industry value prop

163
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
So remember

164
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
The thing that could have most likely shut me down

165
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
At the beginning of the company

166
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Was

167
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Retailers

168
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
Hating what we were doing sure

169
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,847
And calling the designers who we were buying inventory from

170
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
And sang don't work with

171
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Renttherunway

172
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
And that was actually a very likely scenario you can imagine we were renting

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Current

174
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Season designer in

175
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,207
For 5 to 10% of the price at the exact same time that it was at Nordstrom

176
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
A Neiman Marcus

177
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Shadowsocks

178
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Netta Forte for sale

179
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
So the threat was

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
If Nordstrom wood

181
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Call

182
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
The designers and say don't work with Jen

183
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
This is insane why would you put my clothing up for rent

184
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
So

185
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
We started with dresses

186
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Because

187
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
After I called call Diane Von Furstenberg

188
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
The second person I called called

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Was

190
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
The president of Neiman Marcus

191
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
And I decided that I would go straight into

192
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Kind of the belly of the Beast

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,119
The person who is most likely to destroy me I called called him

194
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,215
And I shared the idea for Rent the Runway with him I said what do you think if I were to rent

195
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
You know designer inventory

196
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
For 5% of the price designer dresses

197
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
And he said

198
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
That's a great idea

199
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,223
Women have been renting the runway for my stores for decade

200
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
It's called buying address

201
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Keeping the tags on

202
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
I'm returning it after you born it

203
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Amazing

204
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
And I said

205
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
How often does that happen again this is

206
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
President of Neiman Marcus

207
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
He says

208
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
70

209
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Percent

210
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Of the time

211
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
I was like

212
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
If you know that why don't you stop at they're stealing from you you know their Steel

213
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
His response was I can't stop at the same customer who's renting the runway from the dress department is fine 10 pairs of shoes downstairs

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
It's my best

215
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Who are exhibiting this Behavior

216
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Fun fact

217
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,863
I proceeded to cold call the

218
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
CEOs of all of the major

219
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
So I met with Macy's in

220
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Saxon Nordstrom

221
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
That's great

222
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,895
So don't the Rent the Runway rate at Macy's is only 35%

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Whereas at Neiman Marcus at 70% proving once and for all the rich people steal more than poor people

224
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Yes

225
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
Two important point which is

226
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Do you think I mean

227
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
Given that you created this very disruptive

228
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Brand

229
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
Do you think when when your idea is radical is

230
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Is truly radical

231
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
Like like Rent the Runway is for the fashion industry

232
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
That it's better to face that idea in slowly

233
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
So there's two approaches there's the

234
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Rent the Runway approach

235
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
And there's the

236
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
You would say the Uber approach

237
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
The Rent the Runway approaches

238
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
We're 9 years in right now

239
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
And the industry considers us to be their most important

240
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Partner

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
They want us to be success

242
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Then you have

243
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
A business like uber which of course is

244
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
Huge and unbelievably

245
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Successful but kind of barreled its way in

246
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Two Cities

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
And countries all over the world end

248
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Sometimes when you borrow your way and you get

249
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,687
A huge amount of government resistance and

250
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
People deciding

251
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,343
On the ballot whether or not you should be there and you're you're starting to face the Reaper

252
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
Repercussions of that down the line so I would say that

253
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
We started off

254
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
In a weaker position with the industry now we're in a very strong position with the industry and it allows us to innovate

255
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Very quickly

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,519
And as you've seen we've gone so quickly from being a business that just rent

257
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Special occasion

258
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Clothing

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Two now renting

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,503
Everything that you might want to wear and our average subscriber is using us 120 days

261
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,343
The year my favorite said is you are the biggest dry cleaner in America

262
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
We believe it's in the world

263
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
That that's certainly a business that I never thought I would be in

264
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
Did you have a plan be like if this was

265
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Going to fail

266
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Did you

267
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Eva

268
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
Something that you would pay that towards or did you not even think about that

269
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,615
I never even thought of it because honestly I didn't even have a plan A

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
I

271
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
We started working on Rent the Runway be

272
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Because I had this idea and thought

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,135
But this sounded really fun and that this was something that would Empower women

274
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Difeel

275
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Their best

276
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Before the moments that matter

277
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
And we started working on it and it was really fun

278
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,375
And 10 years later it's even more fun

279
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
And

280
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,519
I never thought oh I want to be an entrepreneur let me brainstorm an idea

281
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,103
It was just that I saw what was happening in the world around me

282
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
And I saw that there was an opportunity

283
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
When I had the confidence to say you know what

284
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
I'm going to pursue this

285
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
But if it doesn't work

286
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
I can just get another job

287
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
There are lots of early-stage entrepreneurs in this audience

288
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
What are you if you were sitting there and you were a painter 10 years ago and you're watching a version of you up here

289
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
What what

290
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Do you wish you would have known then that you know now

291
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
I think that

292
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Entrepreneur

293
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
And Founders are

294
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Human

295
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
And we're not all geniuses

296
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
And we don't always have the solutions

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
And not

298
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,783
It's a very human thing to pursue a passion and pursue a dream and that

299
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Really

300
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,695
Anyone and everyone can be a fantastic entrepreneur and founder if

301
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Number one

302
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
You have this overwhelming passion

303
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Add a knowledge.

304
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,935
If your idea is successful you're going to be dedicating the next several decades to building it

305
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
This is not some hay

306
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,055
Five years later like on to the next thing

307
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Number two is if you have them

308
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Humility

309
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
To learn

310
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
And to continuously

311
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
Transform yourself and make yourself into

312
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
Into a leader that is growing with the business

313
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
Just think of how quickly a startups

314
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Scales

315
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
And

316
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
Before Rent the Runway I had

317
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Managed all of 10 people

318
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
And now my company has

319
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
1500 people and will likely have

320
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
3000 people by the end of next year

321
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
So every year I have to double my leadership capability

322
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
And you can only do that by

323
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Being really humble

324
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
By listening to others by accepting

325
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Feedback

326
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,063
And by understanding that we are all in the process of

327
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Cell transformation

328
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Tell me

329
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
In the meantime we have your ambition

330
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
You mentioned to me backstage

331
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,839
What your vision is what you wanted to be how big you wanted to get

332
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
So I'm here to build a hundred billion dollar company

333
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
And

334
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,287
To change the way we get dressed

335
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Every single day all over the world

336
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
And to democratize what I think is one of the most

337
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Elite

338
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
Industries on Earth

339
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
And one of the most wasteful Industries on Earth

340
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
We have these

341
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Storage facilities in our bedroom

342
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Cold closets

343
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
That whether or not you care about fashion

344
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Can you spend a lot of money on

345
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
And 80% of that stuff

346
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
Is worn three times or less and ends up in a landfill

347
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
It's in

348
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Sane

349
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
And we can

350
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Offer

351
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
A better way

352
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
To enable people also

353
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
To have freedom

354
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Kids have the freedom to

355
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
To express yourself

356
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
However you want every single day

357
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
And to have that change

358
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
Who we are today is fundamentally

359
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Going to be different

360
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Then who we will be 5 years from now

361
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,815
And you should be able to not have that closet that hold you back that's the story of the past

362
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
But have your closet in the cloud which is the story of right now

363
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
Will you come back on the on the show when you're a hundred billion dollar company

364
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
