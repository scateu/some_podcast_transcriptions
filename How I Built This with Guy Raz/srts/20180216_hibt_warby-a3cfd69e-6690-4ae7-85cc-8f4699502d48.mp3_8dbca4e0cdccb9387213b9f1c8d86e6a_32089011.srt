Perfect pear

11
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,456
Hey it's guy here and I got a random bit of trivia for you

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,296
A year after Jack Kerouac wrote on the road

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
Came out with the second book

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Just called the Dharma bums

15
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,904
Intruders characters actually

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
Inspire the name of a real-life company

17
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
One character was Warby and the other was Parker

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
And the company is well

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
Yes

20
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:42,240
You're all about that and a lot more on this episode which originally ran back

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
2006

22
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
We haven't told anyone that the site was lying if you didn't want to drive any traffic to it because we weren't sure

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
I get an order and then 10 minutes later we get another order

24
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
And then another order and another order and kind of go from there

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Feeling of elatement to a crap

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
From NPR it's how I built this

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Shellback innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movement since they built

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Gyros and

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Founders of Warby Parker tell the story of how they first and idea idea that disrupted the

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,072
The entire eyeglass industry in America

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Andrew into a billion dollar company

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
So back in 2008 and Eagle Blumenthal and Dave gilboa arrived on the campus

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
Best of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania

34
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
They were there to start business school and they met each other and two other students Andy Hunt and Jeff Raider the for them

35
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Delmonico found Warby Parker but in 2008 at that time they didn't know that yet but they didn't

36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
Know something that they all had in common was they were really frustrated with how I glasses worked

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
It's 10 from this thing that will most people probably experience at some point they kept

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Using the glasses and Dave and back right before he started a business school at accidentally left his

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
Glasses on an airplane and it cost me $700

40
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,344
And I just can't justify the full-time student paying that much for a new pair of glasses

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,976
The new iPhone 3-g had come out that way tomorrow at the Apple Store paid $200 for and it did

42
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
All these magical things

43
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
And meanwhile

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
The technology behind a pair of glasses is 800 years old in it

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Didn't make sense

46
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
And what you're like okay I've got this

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
This amazing iPhone this magical

48
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,664
Portal 2 all of you knowledge eyeglasses made out of

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Plastic

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Are like

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
Super expensive I was complaining to anyone that would listen about my glasses were so expensive and then and

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
Cat losing his glasses

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
And you was buying everything online but can figure out why you can buy new glasses online

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,704
Affectively sunglasses on my right because this like 2008 and

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
I mean by that point wasn't like it

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Do you like selling things online

57
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Brand new idea

58
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Yeah and so

59
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
We kind of started this conversation where we are

60
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Kind of frustrated by different

61
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Pieces of the eyewear industry

62
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
And we knew that Neil had spent

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
A number of years

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
I'm working for an hour not profit and

65
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
And probably knew a lot more

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
About this and we did and so

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
We're on the computer lab one day

68
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
And that we start asking me all about

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Question then

70
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,144
No pun intended that any color eyes are open that there was this massive Viber

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
What do you remember about that meeting in the

72
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Computer lab me I will acordes

73
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
It was

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
Servite choir glasses so expensive then when I was

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Working at nonprofit

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Visionspring I've actually designed eyewear

77
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
And I would go to the factories

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Mapreduce

79
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Glasses and

80
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,880
So I knew a little bit about the optical industry

81
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
And it's dominated by a few very large companies

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Is wonderful H's luxottica

83
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Exotic has a market cap of

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
About 30 billion dollars

85
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
They

86
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
Jamon Oakley Ray-Ban Oliver Peoples

87
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Persol and Arnett

88
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
They license almost every major fashion brand Under the Sun like Ralph

89
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,615
Florin and Chanel and Prada and Dolce & Gabbana

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
They also own a lot of the major

91
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Retail chains like

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
LensCrafters in

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
Pearle Vision in Sunglass Hut

94
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
All those things that's crazy Sears Optical Target Optical

95
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Persol Rayban

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
All owned by the same company

97
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,863
All in by the same company end they on the second largest vision insurance plan

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
In the country I met

99
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
So

100
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,519
You walk into a LensCrafters you don't realize that most of their selection

101
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Card frames

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
That they've made

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
And the vision insurance

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Music is all

105
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
So you do this

106
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
The brain exactly

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
So we just

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Thought like a

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
Well now it's a lot clearer why glasses are so expensive

110
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
So we thought oh

111
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Why not

112
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
God says I am

113
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
The light bulbs went off in

114
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
In all of our minds

115
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
And then later that night

116
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Like you know when you have a feeling

117
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,775
Or just an ideal you're so excited about yes you have trouble sleeping

118
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Exactly

119
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
It was that feeling

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Things like 2 in the morning

121
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Shut off an email

122
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
And then it like 201 Davis

123
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,319
Responded and 202 Jefferson an alien spotted in like we were all

124
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Up thinking about

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Next day

126
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
We decide hey

127
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,047
After class let's all get together and when she sat down at a bar right on 23rd and Walnut

128
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
Andover beer we're discussing this more

129
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
And

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Should we do this

131
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Should we really go after this and we also said yeah

132
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
How do you say

133
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Business school and you were thinking what did you do

134
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Play quite a business plan that you start looking for all of us we talked about how

135
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
Excited we were about this idea and he said well we're at business school to learn how to write a business what better way than to actually be

136
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Ourselves so

137
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
We all decide to take the same class in entrepreneurship class

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Without thought of that class is edible business plan and we spent the next several weeks

139
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,319
Really researching every element of our idea of getting

140
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
I'm a bunch of great insights from professors

141
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
Running a bunch of surveys standing for hours in different optical shops in and then that culminated in

142
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
40 page business plan

143
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
We entered the Wharton business plan competition and we got

144
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Got eliminated in The semifinal round

145
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
They just kind of put a chip on her shoulder

146
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
Why are we sad okay well now we got something to prove and

147
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
At that point we felt really fast

148
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
Going to work

149
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Taper Avenue

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
You still did not

151
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Money I'm assuming

152
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
You didn't have a product

153
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
You didn't have a manufacturer so

154
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Why were you guys

155
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
How are you even able to

156
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Detest the idea

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
Yeah we talked to everyone

158
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
That will give us five minutes

159
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
That's about the idea initially we got a bunch of pushback

160
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
It said well gatea buying glasses online is

161
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
It's kind of strange to me

162
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Kahoot

163
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Basically all our friends in class

164
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
And a lot of people told us that

165
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Creating a brand is hard enough

166
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
So is crating

167
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
E-commerce site

168
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
Like one of those but for us the magic

169
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
And creating a vertically integrated brand

170
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,327
I'm so behind in on this issue that we had to figure out

171
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
People can try on glasses

172
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
People are saying

173
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Nobody's going to buy glasses online because

174
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
You got a touch of me to feel them

175
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Exactly

176
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,591
Surreal moment of self-doubt

177
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Journeys are always

178
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
These moments where you feel like it

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Complete idiot

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
I this was like one of those challenges that

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Really made us question

182
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Should we continue to spend

183
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Time time on this versus

184
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Is the million other things that we could

185
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Be doing at school

186
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
So how did you

187
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Stinky to get over this

188
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Problems of people

189
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
You know thinking they needed

190
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
To touch them to try them on

191
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
So we just thought a lot about how do we

192
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Remove every obstacle

193
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
To purchasing

194
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
And the thought was well if we offer

195
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
Are free shipping that will encourage people to buy if we are

196
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Offer free returns

197
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
That will also

198
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Make it less risky for our customers

199
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
And that's

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
Should have led us to this other idea to do a home try-on program

201
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
So you guys decide

202
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Let's send these

203
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
France people let them try

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
And they like them

205
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
They just send them back and we'll put the lenses in and that's it

206
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Did you guys have any other problems that you

207
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
Anticipated

208
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
As you were thinking

209
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
True

210
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Jetix other element

211
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,031
Was that we were trying to sell a product normally cost several hundred dollars

212
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
And

213
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
We were selling for

214
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Less than on

215
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Hundred dollars in so

216
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
There was inherent skepticism about the quality

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Inside Wayside log

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
How do we just

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Get as many of our glass

220
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
People's faces possum

221
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Yeah and that's when

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
This light bulb

223
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm trying program

224
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
How much really know

225
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
No company

226
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
I was offering

227
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Until that time

228
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Beside we just want to get

229
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Product auntie

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
People's faces

231
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
White people by after work

232
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
So you guys wanted your glasses

233
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Competition

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Even less than a hundred bucks

235
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
How

236
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
How did you decide on the

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
Our initial thought was to sell glasses

238
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
For $45

239
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
We remember going into the head of the marketing department

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
That's office at Wharton

241
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
And we sit next to him

242
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Slide the deck on his desk

243
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Say hey

244
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Where can I transform the optical industry

245
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
We're going to charge $45 for a $500 pair of glasses

246
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
How many kinds of sloths.

247
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
I said no I won't work

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,727
Black sweet you didn't even like retard act like every graph goes up and to the right

249
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
And he said

250
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
I'm sorry guys I first of all

251
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Prices

252
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Biggest indicator of quality

253
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,967
And it's just outside of the realm of believability that

254
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
You can sell a product

255
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
4/10

256
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Surprise

257
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
So we walked out this meeting pretty deflated

258
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
But it led us

259
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
To investigate pricing a little further and

260
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
It showed us

261
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
That

262
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Yes prices

263
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Time indicator quality

264
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
There's a psychological barrier around $100

265
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
So one thought was she

266
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,799
We charge $99 and we thought that was too discounting and cheap at wework building an aspirational brand

267
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
So we actually settled on $95

268
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Using just our instinct

269
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,247
Thinking that this doesn't sound cheap and that it looks deliberate and Visually looks

270
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
50 Cent

271
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
How did you guys

272
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Come up with an a

273
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,743
Because it sounds like like an aristocrat from like you know

274
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Northumberland

275
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
In England or something like Warby Parker

276
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
The hardest thing that we did in those early days was

277
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Set 11 a.m. that all four of us like

278
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
Thank you still have our spreadsheet that over 2,000 names that we tested

279
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
On our very patient friends

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Yeah

281
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Too early Jack Kerouac characters

282
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,343
That data actually discovered when he went to the New York Public Library exhibit on Cadillac

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
And

284
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
To the characters wear Warby pepper

285
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
And Zack Parker

286
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
And that's a good thing

287
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
Military and now everybody that

288
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
I joints Warby Parker

289
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
On the first day on their desk together

290
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Copy of Dharma bums

291
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
Come out with a few other goodies

292
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
That's near Blumenthal of Warby Parker after the break Neil and co-founder Dave gilboa

Hey welcome back to how I built this

341
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
From NPR on garage and Taylor show we've got Neil Blumenthal and Dave gilboa two of the founders of Warby

342
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Parker

343
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
Come up with this idea and they thought it through and

344
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Now

345
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
The only thing left

346
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
What's the exit

347
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
How much money did you guys

348
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Raise initially.

349
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
And how did you do it

350
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
So the next thing about business school is that most people work

351
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
For a few years before going back to school and so

352
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
Collectively the four of us 2

353
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Our life savings from

354
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
When we were working before school and invested into the business

355
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
We invested $120,000

356
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Between the four of us

357
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
To get the business

358
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Stop the ground

359
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Yeah we work for year-and-a-half

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
Helping yourself salary we didn't have an office

361
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
We did win a couple of grams

362
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
From Morton to that that helped as well.

363
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
We were very Scrappy and

364
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Famous bootstrap

365
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
Quite a while and we ended up

366
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Launching a business and then when

367
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Another

368
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151

When you work at that

375
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Nonprofit

376
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Yeah

377
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
Wheel ever show all the relationships that I had then

378
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
To visit the factories

379
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
And we actually

380
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Prepared

381
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
A PowerPoint

382
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Because even though

383
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
This was going to be a vendor that we are

384
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Buying from

385
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
But we have to sell them on our vision

386
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
And that we weren't.

387
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Need serious and

388
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
How far to pay them

389
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Forsyth Tech

390
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
What's the payment up front

391
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Okay so you pay for these frames

392
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
That the manufacturer makes them

393
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
What did you even

394
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
2 with all those glasses

395
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
To remember getting

396
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Boxes and boxes of these

397
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Frames

398
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Ship to

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
Our apartment and it was a doorman building the doorman had

400
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,239
No idea what to do it literally took us

401
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
A couple hours to load

402
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Do all these runs

403
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
In the elevator

404
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Into our apartment

405
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
Then stack all these

406
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
And then unpack them and we

407
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Ourselves

408
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Inspectah deck

409
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Every single frame

410
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
Yeah and this was all the while

411
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
We were

412
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Working today

413
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Figure out

414
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
How are we going to watched

415
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
We basically

416
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Need to start a business only ambassador

417
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Free things

418
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Our initial inventory

419
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
Our website

420
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Handsome PR

421
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Knowing that you only have

422
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
One shot

423
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Should have launched

424
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
A brand

425
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Even before you

426
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
You launch the company

427
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
You had a publicist going out trying to

428
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Chadron public

429
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Had meetings with

430
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Almost 50

431
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
PR firms

432
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Part of it was us evaluating them but

433
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
I'm at the same time we had to sell ourselves to the

434
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Does PR firms

435
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
Nothing less sexy in the Fashion World in for mbas for Morton

436
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
We knew we were going to launch

437
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Sometime in the

438
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Spring of 2000

439
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
10

440
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
And we really wanted

441
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
To be in

442
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Premiere magazine does

443
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Approval

444
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
So what we were targeting

445
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
DQ in love

446
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
And so

447
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
We had some production samples

448
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
We didn't have a website up

449
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
But we really pitching

450
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
How these magazines as

451
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Exclusive launch partners

452
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
We were

453
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
Thrilled to hear that

454
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
DQ envogue organize run stories we have no idea

455
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
What does stories were look like

456
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
What the content was going to look like

457
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Totally hustlin

458
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
I mean

459
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Why would these huge magazine

460
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Lake Trust

461
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
A bunch of

462
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Business school students

463
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,311
Didn't even have a company like if you went to the website at that point there was nothing up there like

464
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Crazy to think that they

465
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
They would have done that right

466
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,479
I can do a few things at work in our favor right one was identifying

467
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
The right

468
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
PR

469
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Person to help represent us

470
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
But we often say that

471
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Tiaras

472
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Like 30% the messenger 70%

473
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
The message

474
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Address the message

475
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
Pretty novel at the time right there was

476
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,631
Nobody selling glasses online so the idea of selling glasses online

477
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
What's novel

478
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
That $95 price point

479
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
For $500 glasses

480
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Funny novel

481
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
The home try-on program was novel so in fact

482
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
GQ actually called us the Netflix by we're in the article.

483
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
They put

484
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
So I think they were

485
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
These hooks that writers and editors could get excited about

486
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
So how much of an impact did that does that have on

487
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
The launch

488
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah we we were

489
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Just blown away by that

490
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Impact that it hadn't

491
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
The traffic in sales so

492
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
We got a call from

493
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Are publicist

494
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
The day before.

495
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,727
Kiki was going to hit newsstands and we still had a landing page up

496
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
He went to warbyparker.com it said coming soon

497
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
Please enter your email address

498
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
GQ sitting tomorrow

499
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
And our website still had a bunch of bugs in it we are working

500
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
1 developer

501
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
And we were on the phone with him kind of frantically

502
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Working out some of the most critical

503
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Bugs

504
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Senesite

505
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
And we finally at 4 a.m. Saturday

506
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Guys listen

507
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Stable enough

508
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
We all need a couple hours of sleep before we have class tomorrow

509
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
SILive

510
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
And

511
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
We were sitting in class

512
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
The next day

513
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,103
We haven't told anyone that the site was live our

514
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
Parents don't know the site was live are best friends didn't know the site

515
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Would live

516
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
But we didn't want to drive any traffic to

517
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
Because we weren't sure it would wear

518
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Had my phone set up to

519
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Be notified anytime we got an order

520
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
And so is around 10 a.m.

521
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
And so I get an order and then 10 minutes later we get another order and then another order in another order

522
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,239
And we can go from this feeling of elatement

523
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,103
Oh crap we have to have this much inventory

524
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,247
And we hadn't contemplated building in any sold-out functionality or weightless functionality of the site

525
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,159
So you are literally selling out of glasses but people still ordering them because it's the website

526
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Didn't know when you would run out of that we had no inventory tracking at all because we knew we were assuming one to two orders a day

527
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,911
And got a job that peanut nothing else my mom would buy a hundred pairs of glasses from us

528
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:56,799
But we are we really have tempered expectations because we also recognize that what we were trying to do was build a brand

529
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
And that takes a really long time

530
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,455
So we called an emergency meeting after that first hour-and-a-half class and we were debating

531
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,807
Okay what do we do here or do we just keep taking orders and then figure out what to tell

532
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Bellator do we take down website

533
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,511
And while we're having the 2-minute discussion I'm looking at my phone and we have 10 more orders am I get to delete we got to do something

534
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
And tell

535
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
We place an emergency call to our developer

536
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
And miraculously was able

537
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
The building

538
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Is weightless functionality on the

539
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
NF lie

540
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
And within

541
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
FR week.

542
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Meat sold out of

543
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Our best-selling Styles we had to wait

544
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
List of 20000 customers

545
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Did you guys sell

546
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Yeah 10000

547
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,391
You just did not I you would not ordered enough glasses from the manufacturer like you you literally

548
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Couldn't and they couldn't make them fast enough for you

549
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
You know it I think

550
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,839
I think we were ambitious in terms of the number of frames that we purchased but also

551
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
Not overly risk-tolerant

552
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
And I think we've

553
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Approach this business in

554
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,335
In a way that yeah that's not bankrupt ourselves on the inventory or you're also constrained and we hadn't raised any money

555
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Investors

556
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
Yeah it was our our lifesaver

557
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Things that we poured into there was

558
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Really a

559
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
A limited

560
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Number of frames that we have the ability to

561
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Purchase

562
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
I mean

563
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
Sounds like a good problem to have

564
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
That you you have a waitlist

565
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
20000

566
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Pokeball user

567
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Out of the gate

568
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Killing it

569
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Is that am I right or was it actually

570
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
IPad Pro

571
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
I think we've learned a lot of important lessons in

572
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Early days where

573
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
We were terrified that

574
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
May we had all these early adopters

575
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,616
Excited to place an order from us and we didn't have anything to sell them

576
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
And for a lot of customers it took us

577
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Numbers of 9 months

578
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
How to get through the weight

579
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
So we were terrified who are these people are going to

580
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
With a bad taste in their mouth

581
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
They were waiting a lot of companies

582
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Not survive that

583
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Yeah yeah I think

584
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
Did have some positive effects that it created

585
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Surah that

586
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Wow this is

587
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Andrea Lee Height

588
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
Nothing creates cool like scarce

589
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
But I think we also learned

590
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
At 11

591
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Terms of

592
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Being empathetic to customers

593
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Founders we reached out to everyone on that waitlist

594
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
M4

595
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
People that were had

596
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Bad experiences

597
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
We're really disappointed we could give them

598
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Glasses

599
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
People discount

600
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
You know what I think

601
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
From the gecko we wanted

602
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
How to create a

603
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Impact in the world

604
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Part of that

605
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Treating

606
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Customers Fair Lady

607
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
Treat them fairly welcome

608
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
What's the price

609
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Treating them

610
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Fairly

611
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
They call up and

612
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Complain

613
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
Bantu apologized and explained

614
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
Make mistakes and then have something that

615
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
We did from the very beginning

616
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Premier League

617
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
We're still trying to figure out

618
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
How to run this business

619
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Apartments

620
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
I'm students

621
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Our customer service line

622
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
What a Google Voice number that we set up when someone

623
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Call

624
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
It would simultaneously

625
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Clearing all four Founders cell phone

626
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,536
Santa Barbara customer service

627
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608
And so we looked at our class schedules and their 12 hours

628
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
4 week when all four of us were

629
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
During class at the same time

630
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
And

631
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,288
We said it why we should hire someone who can answer the phone when none of us are available

632
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
And so we hired

633
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
The name Rin

634
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,200
I said you're going to be working 12 hours a week and transfer

635
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Are doing and

636
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
I make that first weeks ended up

637
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Working 100 hours

638
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,368
And now she's running our custom

639
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Experienced team has about a hundred

640
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
50 people

641
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,256
And says as I kind of Off to the Races from day one

642
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
So did you guys I mean how quickly

643
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Did you guys come out

644
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Get together

645
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
Holy hell

646
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
This is real

647
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Can I make it

648
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,920
We were too busy staying up all night to emails and

649
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,552
I remember when the first couple days like we actually decided to go to one of the classes that we were all in

650
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
And

651
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
We were all typing

652
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
Previously on our computers cuz we weren't really paying attention and we were just responding to customer emails and helping to process

653
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,096
And everything in the classroom got really quiet

654
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
The four of us are left.

655
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
Everybody was staring at us including the professor and here we were typing away when clearly they were done

656
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
Let's to be happy

657
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
With obvious you are not

658
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,736
You are not listening so we just stopped going to that class

659
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,296
I mean I remember waking up every morning

660
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
With the laptop on my chest

661
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
Because I fall asleep

662
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Persona custom

663
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,744
There's an overwhelming amount of work in those early days and so

664
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
We don't have

665
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Even a minute to breathe in and take a step back

666
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
And think about what was happening

667
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
So after this line

668
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
And after the company obviously

669
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Peanut starts

670
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Contraction

671
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
When did you guys decide

672
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
You know like we we better

673
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Checkered racing money

674
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
And we went

675
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
And try to get

676
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,504
Because we figured like why give up equity

677
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
We could just get some loans to help us

678
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Find the Symmetry that we needed

679
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,416
We went to 18 different banks

680
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
And only one

681
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Would talk to us

682
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
And again this was

683
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
2010 so soon after

684
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
The financial crisis

685
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
And what all these loan officer status

686
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Hey we've never seen such

687
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,336
It's a beautiful business plan we've never seen a company that has such great early results

688
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
But

689
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
We can't give you a loan

690
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
Because you don't have two years of tax returns

691
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
So what did you guys do

692
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
We ended up

693
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Getting

694
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
$200,000 SBA loan

695
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
We had to sign

696
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Pride 400 documents

697
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
Including one that said we weren't going to use the money to open a zoo

698
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
And

699
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
We really try to think of other creative forms of financing

700
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Business

701
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
And so we working

702
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
With a third party will just

703
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Text company that managed

704
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
Summer inventory

705
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
And

706
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
CL leather brand are business in

707
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,200
He was asking what can he do to help Drive growth in our business or that

708
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
They can have more business

709
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
I really constrained by

710
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Are billion purchase inventory of this

711
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Pyside Wild

712
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
You guys seem like a really good APR

713
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
Our company need some help

714
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
OTR what if

715
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,536
You do some PR Consulting for us

716
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
And

717
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
We'll pay you a few hundred thousand dollars

718
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,640
So I guess you launched in 2010

719
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Today you have close to me

720
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
800 employees

721
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
You sold

722
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
I'm sure millions of pairs of glasses

723
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
How much do you think you are successful

724
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Was because of

725
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
You know you guys are

726
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Smart angular

727
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Really hard workers or

728
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
Or how much of it was black

729
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
To say that there's a lot of it

730
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Deliberate serendipity

731
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,264
For example we were really lucky to be exposed to our marketing Professor that helped us think through

732
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Pricing

733
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
We had created Goodwill by

734
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,456
Being friendly and doing well in his class and he was willing to dedicate time to us

735
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
So I think there's a million examples of that or

736
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
I'm our friend

737
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,112
Calling in favors on our behalf

738
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
Want to think that we were just straight up

739
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Blocky on his timing

740
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Right timing is everything

741
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
They are coming off the financial crisis

742
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
How the public was looking for Lacey

743
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
To save money and I think a brand like ours

744
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Even resonated

745
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Even more

746
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Last year I read that

747
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
That you guys raised like

748
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
A hundred million dollars

749
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Soap

750
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
What's what's the company valued at

751
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
At our last valuation was over billion dollars

752
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
When will you hear that a billion dollars

753
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
That's crazy

754
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
It's pretty crazy

755
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Yeah you know

756
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
It's exciting but not nearly

757
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
As

758
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Exciting

759
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Psych coming to work

760
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Everyday and

761
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Being in an office

762
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,400
Is that we've actually designed ourselves

763
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
Seeing people in the subway wearing our glasses like that one

764
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Never get old can you recognize your glasses

765
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Oh yeah

766
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
A10 fact

767
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
The first time

768
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
We saw the glasses in

769
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
In the wild

770
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
I remember

771
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,736
Seeing this percent of corner of my eye what's on the subway

772
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Fireman

773
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Union Square

774
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
And I just start following the person and UNLV

775
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
If someone's following you on the platform like

776
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
You've got a dirty look but I just big like ear-to-ear smile

777
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:24,960
That's Neil Blumenthal Warby Parker

778
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,104
Neil and Dave gilboa co-founded Warby Parker with two other friends for business school generator and panty hot

779
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,200
Company actually partnered with the nonprofit where Neil used to work fish in Spring

780
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,808
Bring my glasses to people around the world don't have access to them

781
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,280

We are

793
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

794
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
It's time now for how you built that

795
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Updated story

796
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,072
We ran about a year ago this one started when

797
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Kayaking

798
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,960
Freak near Sunset South Carolina

799
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
That created a tunnel all the way down the center of the creek

800
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
The water

801
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Secretly like lay down and go underneath

802
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
So

803
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
That's what he did lay it on top of my kayak

804
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
And went down the creek that way and it was

805
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Exhilarating that's what gave me the very first idea

806
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,000
And his idea was to build something he eventually called a belly a kits

807
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,376
Shaped like a kayak but there's no hollow space in the hall no place to sit

808
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
So instead

809
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
The surface

810
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
You can lie on top and

811
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Paddle with your hand

812
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,384
What I like and it shows it's like flying it's the feeling of flying on water and you know

813
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Having a high performer

814
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Freestyle kayak Hawk

815
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,016
Which is made to respond to every nuance

816
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,856
The current and feeling that through your entire body and having your hands right there in

817
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Current

818
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
That was such a thrilling

819
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Feeling

820
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:26,560
For about a year-and-a-half Adam tinkered in an old Warehouse with some urethane foam

821
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
To get the bellyak

822
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Just wright

823
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
And I feel 24 different

824
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
Model because I would build it and I be like wow that was

825
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
Was good but I need to add a little more volume to the Baldor

826
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,896
What if it were a little narrow here in a little wider here so I thought I would have more Quest

827
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Try that start with one question

828
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Would it be like if

829
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
And after playing around with it for a while he

830
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,904
Finally perfected the bellyak Adam got a patent and he was thrilled because he thought

831
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Kayakers

832
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
They are going to love this thing

833
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
But he was wrong

834
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,096
People look down their nose at it as something that they were too good for

835
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,704
And really it was because Tigers already know how to kayak it's like trying to sell it

836
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
Different type of mountain bikes somebody who Rd mountain bikes they already have their tool for that terrain but over time I don't realize

837
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
Other groups of people who did like the bellyak

838
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
Swimmers triathletes Surfers

839
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,808
And a group he was surprised to hear from him first

840
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,416
Disabled veterans allowed somebody to get out of that wheelchair

841
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
And I can be mobile.

842
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
They could have exercised they can work on their balance and the coolest thing was as I've talked to so many guys have used it has been like man ever since

843
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Since my injury

844
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,984
I've never thought I would swim again and it's helped me get back in the water and that's been the coolest thing to see

845
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
Since we first spoke with Adam last year

846
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:47,712
He was a guest on the TV show Adventure capitalist just kind of like Shark Tank accept all the products are

847
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
Outdoorsy like bikes and skis you know that

848
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
Anyway one of the investors on the show offered to put up $100,000 for 20%

849
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Adams company and he

850
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Shed

851
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
No

852
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
He did not want to give away that much equity

853
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
So for now is growing his

854
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Company slowly

855
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
With no outside investment

856
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
And so far

857
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
He sold about 1500 belly

858
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
