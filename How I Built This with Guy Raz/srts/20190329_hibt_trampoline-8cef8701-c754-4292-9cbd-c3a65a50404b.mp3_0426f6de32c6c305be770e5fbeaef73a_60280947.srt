28
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
I decided to invest in some fundamental research and I wanted ask myself

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
One question did any retailer in America believe the trampolines were dangerous

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
So dangerous that was Costco the CEO of Costco

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Who was the manager of Senegal and Jim said I will not sell trampolines and

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,144
So I made it my mission to try sell Costco trampoline

33
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
From NPR how I built this

Canadian businessman who believed his potential

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Safest

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Backyard trampoline

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
A while back we didn't

41
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,968
Interview with James Dyson and facing a course is the inventor of the Dyson vacuum cleaner

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
Came up with his vacuum you working

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
Backyard shed. Prototype

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
Prototype

45
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Testing

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Perfecting his invention

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
That's a familiar story right

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Finding a problem

49
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Tinkering until

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Finally

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
A solution

52
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
James Dyson manufactured the vacuum cleaners

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Scaled his business and then

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Became one of the wealthiest

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
People in the UK

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
That's not exactly the typical inventor story because for a lot of inventors the end goal

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
That someone else will by and take the market

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
Because a lot of times inventors don't have the

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
More resources or ability to go into business themselves so we're going to do something

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
2 stories

61
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Story of one man Keith Alexander who invented a safer trampoline maybe even this

62
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Safest trampoline ever the story of

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,576
Steve Holmes the man who took that invention and made it into a commercial success

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Because even though Stephen Keith arndt

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Technically business partners

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,536
Springfree Trampoline couldn't have been a success without one or the other

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Keith Alexander grew up in New Zealand

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
His dad was an engineer

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Keith was really sure what

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Wanted to do this life

71
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,336
So he joined New Zealand's version of the Peace Corp and fruit

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
He worked as a grade school teacher

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
But then

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
You decided to go back

75
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
City university

76
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Canterbury

77
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Christchurch

78
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
I found that actually really enjoyed engineering

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,160
Yes I started doing my engineering degree at entry

80
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
And

81
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Suddenly realized

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
That was what I

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,816
I wish somebody told me many years before that I was an excellent engineer

84
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
I found I could

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
To get iced tea

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Quite easily

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
So I did a masters

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
And then did a

89
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
PhD

90
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
I am over you like wait we the kind of engineer who just

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Just always love to

92
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
I like where you always

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
10 Greenway

94
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
I was always

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Can crayfish eat through a PhD

96
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
A table like a

97
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Eventually

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Tools and

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
That's right of Beach

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Put up a bench somewhere if it wasn't there I had these two wrecks

101
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,119
So I made with all the tools on and I can take them off the wall pick them up text

102
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Well I made all sorts of things did not exhibition

103
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
I made a 6

104
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
Mousetrap for that

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
Exhibition a collapsing chair

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
I made walk on water shoes

107
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Defended myself through my Ph.D by winning

108
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Walk on water pump

109
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Wait sorry

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Let's break this down

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
What's what's walk on water

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
Walk on water shoes radio Maven which was

113
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
The radio in

114
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
In Christchurch

115
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
The time

116
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
Put up this competition I walk on water competition thousand-dollar prize

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Sorry

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Bay City

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Weber competition if you can figure out a walk on water weave

120
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
$80,000

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
That's about it

122
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
That's about it okay

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
At that time my father had

124
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Developing simple car motor

125
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
I'm here and I've been playing around with it cuz we had a dinghy

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Weeping fig

127
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
I have to do this

128
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
So that's a tinkering in the garage

129
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
You need some flotation

130
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
The competition put limits

131
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
On how big these

132
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Flotation

133
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Could be so it ended up being

134
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
You will not have anything longer than one meter

135
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Didn't take

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
I need you need to work out how big

137
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Piece of polystyrene at the beach

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
Okay see you you were coming up with

139
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Some kind of flotation

140
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
And you could answer of walk on water

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
With that device it was balanced that would allow you to kind of

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Hover on the surface of the water

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Is that the big stick

144
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
And

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
The solution is put your feet on the bottom

146
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
You got a hole in it

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Can you put the plywood on the bottom

148
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
Topeka right through the bottom and then

149
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
It stays

150
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
The police sirens around rank

151
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
And you invented this

152
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Yes my father and I invented this we had to make it fit

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
The competition

154
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
I flew back from Oakland

155
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Got to stay with my parents

156
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
And I built these shoes

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Competing this

158
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Competition

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
And I'm headed to win the competition

160
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
To using Rock

161
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
I didn't want to feed one adult internet help fund my PhD

162
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Because you got a thousand bucks

163
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
But it's more like $5,000 wow

164
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
So what were some of those things to you

165
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
You bet

166
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
Willfully at exhibition

167
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
Q-Zar

168
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
Enduring experiences with having a hiccup

169
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Doing my PhD at University and

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,271
Young Tootsie lady was giving me the haircut and she said you realize you're standing on top

171
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
It was really embarrassing

172
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
So I thought

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,975
That would be a good thing for young guys to have because you can never see the top of your head so I made this

174
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,631
Bald patch inspector

175
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,519
Move to leave us NF

176
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
It would reflect the other mirror and I could show you the top of your head exact you could see with your going bald

177
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,295
What you do once you finish your PhD

178
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
At first I thought

179
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
If I want to come back to academic life I really need some engineering

180
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Beard Products Inc, valid

181
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Teacher of engineering Elizabeth

182
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
Engineering experience

183
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
So with a PhD

184
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
You decide I've got to go out

185
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Into the world again

186
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Experience

187
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Before I can come by

188
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Absolutely that's right

189
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
So I moved back to Oakland

190
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
And

191
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Got a job in engineering

192
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Consultancy

193
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
What kind of work did you do

194
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
Set it off at the value of a 1 of the value of that I knew nothing about

195
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
But valuation was

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,391
OK Google looking at a piece of machinery and and working out how much cost

197
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,279
And after two weeks I was getting pretty good at it after 2 weeks I found I could do other things as well

198
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Waiting for consultancy gota variety

199
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Was quite a bit of insurance with the West

200
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Air crash investigation

201
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Fort Worth

202
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
As well so it was quite a broad range of

203
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
I wasn't particularly happy with

204
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,199
Because it'll comes out of the money in the end it so how much

205
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Have you been up an invoice this week

206
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
And I really like spending

207
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Time on things

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
Put more time into it thinking it through

209
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Just like I guess the

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
The Miz

211
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
1980s

212
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
You are

213
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Late 30s early 40s

214
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Jeffrey Berry

215
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
I got married

216
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
1985

217
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
So it was while I was at the engineering

218
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Consultant Seattle

219
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
And

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Pretty soon after

221
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Yes

222
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Two and a half years later

223
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
1987

224
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Your first house

225
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
How many kids do you have

226
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Guthrie

227
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
So

228
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Amazon

229
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
As You Are

230
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Doing consulting

231
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
We got a young family

232
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
And

233
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
This is probably a pretty steady

234
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Lifestyle

235
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Yeah so when you would come over

236
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Your consultancy

237
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Consulting job

238
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
Would you come home and then go into your

239
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
The workbench area and

240
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Tinker

241
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Match to the grace of my wife is

242
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
She took her awhile

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Get used to it

244
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
So you would like the mad scientist in the back of

245
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Garden working on

246
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
Crazy ideas not all the time

247
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Not all the time

248
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Are you really once was

249
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm magnetic

250
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Fly machine

251
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
Which was supposed to use the Earth's magnetic field to fly but

252
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
I was very proud of what I did but it didn't work

253
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Do the laws of physics actually support that idea

254
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,031
Idiots in NBA one of the best ideas would be to go to the South magnetic pole and put a big

255
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
Ring of conducting material around the magnetic fields and put a huge current through it and it wouldn't actually flies

256
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Spice

257
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
But it's not a very good place for spiced pork

258
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Trying to solve problems like is that right

259
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Exactly how you would

260
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
That's pretty good if other people haven't been able to solve it I want to solve it it's a real charge me that's something

261
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,407
Excites me no one else has done that's all I want to do this because no one else has done it

262
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
What was it eventually

263
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
When I was a kid I'd love to trampoline I just love the idea of being in the airport

264
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
You couldn't buy a trampoline in those days

265
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
Elizabeth a gymnastics trampoline I wish we had one of the school and then the gym class

266
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
To get city kids there and we had to get on jump three three bouncy seat drop get off next bus that was

267
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Is it that was my jumping and I love this

268
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Yeah and that really frustrated me

269
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
So when I start to become available in the shops

270
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
And I had a young child

271
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Going to get one of these

272
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,767
Young and I'll be able to bounce on at 2 and so I said to my wife to get a trampoline

273
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
The Katy

274
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
She said

275
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,959
No I take it a place in town they don't have it trampoline place either they just too dangerous

276
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
1989

277
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
Does it snow today

278
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
And she said trampolines not safe I think I'll just

279
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Look at the research

280
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
See what I can find

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
So I looked at the research

282
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Sure enough

283
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
Even in New Zealand that being some research

284
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Fishtown on the increase

285
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Injuries from trampoline

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
And I thought well I really

287
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
Maybe I can do something about it I'm an engineer should be able to do something about

288
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
And that's that's when it started

289
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
So you look as research

290
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
And you

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
You realize your wife is right

292
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Things were not

293
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
My wife is right dammit

294
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
But you wanted a trampoline and you wanted one for your daughter

295
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Scientifical way around that

296
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
So what you do

297
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
South Hill Rite boat

298
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
If I can design

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Joshua trampoline

300
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
It's pretty simple

301
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,087
Shirley Arkansas fair catch the engineering

302
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
And I love designing things like this.

303
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
So we are going to do it

304
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Let's design one that she likes it

305
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
And maybe you can even sell it

306
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
I don't know

307
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
To take me back to that

308
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
You're thinking

309
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
I want to see if I can

310
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Top with a

311
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Trampoline

312
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Where do you start

313
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
I mean to you

314
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
What's the time

315
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Easily available

316
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Why did you even start to

317
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Think about

318
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
How you do this

319
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,551
Right so going to come up with the trampoline what what are the issues here that we have to solve

320
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Annnd

321
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
Traditional trampoline is God steel bar around the outside agent

322
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Springs

323
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
What decided and then the math is Jump On In The Middle

324
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
And I can see that it's dangerous cuz the exit right to going off on his

325
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Pretty obvious

326
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
You give this nice bouncy things

327
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
The kids and I know about celebrity knocked loose

328
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Ctrl + f4 on the bottle that fell down the hole between the spray

329
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
So are they fall off

330
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
When I pull up

331
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
But the thing that probably hit first is distilled out on the edge

332
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
That's the thing that impressed me most I thought that still bad it's not fair

333
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
Let's see if we can get rid of that steel Bob that's that's a good step

334
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
So I'm thinking about

335
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Inflatable things are soft

336
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Why do we replace

337
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
The steel frame with an inflatable ring

338
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Just like a big inner tube and it's stretched

339
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
The trampoline

340
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Mets roster

341
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Would that work

342
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
OIC like a giant

343
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Heavy duty dinnerware

344
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
2 Tire

345
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
And then you would have like a

346
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Canvas

347
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Inside of it in

348
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
In this spring apart would come from the inner tube

349
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
At first I thought Rockwell put Springs on

350
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
American foot rope around a to hold this

351
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Spring so we could talk

352
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
I have the Met

353
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
Connected to the Springs at so I sketched this up and I got to Kansas

354
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
I need to make a map

355
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Full mean I got some

356
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Trampoline springs in summer

357
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
A bar

358
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
The coolest Seabiscuit a big inflatable

359
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,655
Like a zodiac book circular

360
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,311
From the tennis company actually

361
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
At that time

362
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
My son was at 2 and 1/2 years old

363
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,271
He bounced thought he could bounce a little life was only about the height of it

364
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Cheer

365
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Selfie kid

366
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
Fell off they didn't have far to go and the edge was

367
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Inflatable on salt lamp

368
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,071
You actually literally made this you stretched canvas over the giant rubber tire

369
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Thingy thing

370
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,215
And I and you had your kids Jump On It.

371
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,031
First one has built one

372
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
So the one that we

373
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
Only made a couple thousand dollars for

374
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Just had the Met

375
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Selling into that

376
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Top page of this big ring

377
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
And that was good for the kids at the time

378
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
And your wife was happy with that shoot

379
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Is totally comfortable with us he was really happy with that this is something the kids could actually

380
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
Pick up and cut around the backyard and this is like how big was it that was about 8 feet across

381
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
The Mets score

382
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Five feet because it was on the top of it

383
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
The big

384
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Problem with it well several big problems that number one the material cost for that was about $800

385
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,527
The back of that time just the material cost to put is no Manufacturing in that it

386
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
Always late there's always someone supposed to be

387
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,583
Didn't matter how many times I put in a pot inside to find a leak there's a problem to problems there a problem

388
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
It just wasn't I mean I couldn't get any height on this did not bring you back to your school

389
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Days we had those three jobs

390
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Fly

391
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
3 is all you don't want to jump into hot

392
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
So it was great is great for the kids to have it

393
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
It wasn't what I wanted

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
You start to realize that the same as just knocking

395
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
This is not

396
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Going to be the saying that

397
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Makeup be fun for a while for the kids but

398
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Stipulated

399
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Can jump very high

400
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
And anyway you can Market

401
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
So what are you do you go back

402
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
To you or to the garage

403
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Start again

404
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
Well around about that time I

405
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
I sat down on

406
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Summarize all the skates

407
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Cuz I got no lie ideas I got

408
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
This is not down

409
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
They all got to come up with other ways of doing

410
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
I went through a whole range of ideas

411
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
And came up with

412
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Civil court

413
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Complicated ways of using

414
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
So I just stages

415
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Working at the University kind of job

416
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Christchurch

417
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
Entrust your teaching mechanical engineering I'm assuming

418
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
I had a contract on you contract it wasn't a full-time job so I didn't have tenure

419
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
But I had a job there

420
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
And that meant that I could for educational paper

421
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Just give students projects

422
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah the final year of engineering

423
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
The students get individual project

424
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
How did we go to Hold Ya

425
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
So I put that up as a

426
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Project he's an idea for making a trampoline

427
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Completely differently woodspring some

428
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Why what can you do as a

429
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
16 but can you come up with

430
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Suggested just to get a sense of Oneness is were talking about

431
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Mid-1990s

432
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
Like 95-96 more and then

433
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
I start at University in 96

434
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
I ran a couple of University projects

435
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
96-97

436
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
And

437
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,111
I getting pretty close guidelines cuz it's a lot of thought into it he's away I think we could do it

438
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
Could you build one

439
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
How could you do the analysis on us

440
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
And at that

441
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Time

442
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
I had the

443
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,399
I did in my mind and I found it very difficult to measure never seen anything like it was a bit like a boss

444
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
It with the

445
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
These at these are things I like fishing rods

446
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Obviously if you

447
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Go to fish on the envy

448
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Fishing with a fishing rod

449
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
It'll keep sensational

450
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Maybe I can make one like that

451
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
What is an out of that material

452
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Something like five

453
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Fiberglass Rocket fishing rod

454
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,975
Material and I thought well if you stuck at a fishing rod on the ground of Italy on your stuff another one over here and you're tied something

455
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
Between them you get the tension but then that's sticking out these things

456
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
The sticking straight up but if you are on a trampoline on

457
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
On the top of you fell on it

458
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
Because the vertical if you fell right on the edge you can pause your cell phone

459
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
So what if we laid them over

460
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
So that that 45 degrees

461
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Then if you landed on them

462
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
So that was the idea

463
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
Suggestive pictures my mine

464
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Yes it was

465
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Could you get some kind of a tree looks

466
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Let's go fishing rod

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Lakeshore Drive

468
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Yeah

469
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,903
At an angle of 45° in a circle

470
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
And stretch canvas over that

471
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
And essentially

472
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
That would be the tree

473
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Bounce on the canvas

474
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
That was laid over these

475
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Tangled

476
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Rods that

477
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
That were bendy

478
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
That that's a pretty good description of

479
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
So yuan

480
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,663
Students working on a prototype of the snood

481
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
Trampoline design

482
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
Diamond full size vans 8-foot diameter

483
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
How to work using using those like

484
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Fiberglass

485
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
Fishing rods the fiberglass rod

486
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
That's why I was sitting it was more bouncy than the inflatable one so it's going in the right direction

487
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Exactly there yet

488
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,055
Yes you're right I was thinking I need to get a commercial pissing involved at this stage

489
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,943
I don't know whether it's going to be commercial no idea let's contact someone

490
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
I want to ask you about

491
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,623
I would imagine was like obligation which is at this point

492
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Yuan

493
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Keith Alexander

494
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,023
Backyard speaker you are also Keys Alexander

495
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
Professor at this University

496
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
What that mean about all the work you do

497
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
University

498
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
It's their property

499
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Mighty you are

500
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Stanford Harvard or whatever

501
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
That's exactly what I'm supposed to be doing is

502
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Publishing paper

503
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
They did have this

504
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
New policy that just came in

505
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,695
Couple months after I started they said if you come up with an idea that's commercialized

506
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
Got until this new commercialization office

507
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
It would just developed

508
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Now that you've done it

509
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Because it belongs to University

510
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
100%

511
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Or am I thought while I haven't already thought of this

512
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
I'll be doing this at home for a while

513
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
And now got a job with University

514
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
Well icon

515
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
I got to do that

516
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
They say then I had to do it

517
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
So now every idea you have

518
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
They are which is not uncommon

519
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
It's not uncommon

520
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
So I went along with it

521
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
I'll let them have it

522
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
If I can commercial Isaac

523
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
So I took it to them

524
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Show them listed all that's fine

525
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Kids toy

526
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
See what we can do

527
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
Which but in the meantime they

528
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
They were just like you do whatever you want

529
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
They were not paying attention

530
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Dental painting

531
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
And that what they wanted this summer

532
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
I was going to make

533
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Millions of dollars

534
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
Really want a child

535
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
They want like a

536
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Biotech

537
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
Something

538
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,599
Trampoline World

539
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
These guys working on

540
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Nanotech

541
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,952
So I looked in the Yellow Pages

542
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
I found the biggest trampoline manufacturer in New Zealand

543
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
He was selling 400 trampolines

544
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
I bring them up

545
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,912
And he said yeah I'm interested send me some photos

546
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
I'll be in Christ you still coming over look

547
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
3 time

548
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
And I had them all day from

549
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
He jumped on them

550
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
He said well the inflatable one

551
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
I like that

552
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
But not as a trampoline

553
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
I like

554
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
It's a great pool toy

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
The one with the ROTC

556
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Compromise

557
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
To live

558
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
It's got to be hot going to be dangerous

559
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Make the kids think it's

560
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,072
That's going to be bigger Saatchi small-cell want something is 10

561
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
And it's go to

562
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Take down so it can be shipped

563
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
So you have to be able to pull apart and assembly

564
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
And it's

565
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
It's got to be able to be assembled by a solid matter with no Tools in half an hour

566
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
On Christmas Eve after

567
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
She's at a glass of wine

568
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,808
Because I always get people ring me open Christmas Eve saying how do I say move my trampoline

569
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
So if you can sort out those problems I'll be in

570
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
And you thought

571
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
I don't like it is a challenge

572
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
And we got company now disinterested

573
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,192
And I'll pay one of these students who've was happy to work out a summit to build this 10-foot version and see what we can do

574
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
So that's what we did over the next year we had this

575
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,384
Waking why he built up the 10-foot trampoline that was high

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
Make a test that we can put on a pot

577
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
Put together again

578
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
Put it on two boxes

579
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
We couldn't assemble it in half an hour

580
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
It was another company in in New Zealand it was

581
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
Pain specialist in completely fiberglass

582
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:05,216
Used as a spring Springs

583
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
So we started forming a relationship with then

584
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
They formed a relationship with him

585
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,408
Andis company in food making 450 into you

586
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Had we started to

587
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Build

588
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,296
The prototypes for customer files

589
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
But for the typo customer trial

590
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
And had it turned off

591
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
I was pretty pleased with what we were going to Market at this stage because I had a commercial person

592
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
By products of potassium

593
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
And the guys from the commercial arm of the University came out and have a look because it was a bit of material going on

594
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
They look at it and they said

595
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Unicellular

596
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
Thousand hundred thousand dollars to make it ready

597
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
And then I went away

598
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
The university said

599
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Yeah

600
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
So what

601
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Does that mean

602
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Well

603
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
I thought that was the end of it

604
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Really I thought

605
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
I can't get a hug

606
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
The $50,000 I thought it was market-ready

607
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
I was very depressed

608
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
And you needed the universities

609
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Permission B

610
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Because they owned it

611
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
They only I bet they owned it

612
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,800
I didn't have to do any more I was doing all this work

613
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Supervising this

614
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
How to get the money to

615
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
To support

616
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
Making these customer trial

617
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
So the dream

618
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Dice

619
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Well I thought so

620
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
But

621
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
I always

622
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
Do you like challenges

623
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
And my mother-in-law

624
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Tearing up

625
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
To talk to my wife and when she

626
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Get me on the phone should say

627
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Auntie's house that trampoline going

628
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
I hope you still working on

629
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
So

630
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
This was an idea I really wanted

631
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,152
This is a problem in the world that needed to be solved

632
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
Hilltop glass safe

633
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
I've got to do something about this I'll just have to keep going

634
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,416
Around this time the commercial out of the University hide another person and he died

635
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,048
And he had a look around New Zealand trying to find is there any business in New Zealand or interested and

636
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,448
Canada found someone in Canada case we got someone to Canada

637
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Cinema photos

638
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,872
And we'll see where we go from here when we come back

639
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
Almost 15 years after he started tinkering on a new safer kind of trampoline

640
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,880
He gets to see his invention finally come to Market with us

641
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm gyros near listening to how I built this

642

NPR

676
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
It's early two thousands and

677
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,336
East University find an investor who's interested in the trampoline

678
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
Steve Holt

679
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
At this point

680
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,224
Steve's in his mid-30s he's living in Toronto

681
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,552
He's already been involved in a couple of successful small business

682
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
Help Steve know some investors

683
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:11,744
And he's got access to a little capital in eventually Steven teeth

684
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
To start discussing the details

685
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
A piece of mention the end of the phone call I remember saying okay Keith can you mail it to me can you send it

686
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Shipley the trampoline

687
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
Just shoot me the Tramp

688
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Pause

689
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
The money was an issue right now, going to ship the traffic keeps Private Ryan figure I said I'll send you ten

690
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
$1,000 will you shoot me the

691
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,024
What do you remember about that call it was is similar like you were on the phone with Steve and you just kind of explained

692
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
This invention to it

693
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
I find it pretty hard to remember I was breathing

694
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
It's about anything like that

695
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Fitbit cool would have made me

696
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
But a freak me out

697
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah and

698
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
Shipping something overseas

699
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
I didn't even know that you have to dial 0 0 1 2

700
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Comerica theater

701
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
What are things that didn't like

702
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Calibration David Steve says I'm sending

703
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
Antenna you got $10,000 so you can

704
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Do what

705
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Needs to be done to get me in

706
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Information that I need and get me a trampoline

707
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
And I didn't have that for the money

708
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
When someone says please ship it to the other side of the world has a big deal

709
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,864
And when someone says I'll give you a $10,000 that was a big deal

710
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
So are you so so how long does

711
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
To take

712
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Fort arrive

713
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,104
What's 6 weeks in shipping I can't remember if we are afraid or not but we at the time had a backyard

714
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,200
We really didn't have any grass that was a problem we had patio and so

715
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
When I got it

716
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,624
It was a little overwhelming so I assembled it it probably took me a boat

717
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
3 hours

718
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
And

719
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Several bruises

720
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
End

721
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
My kids interesting that is deaf

722
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
The time of 1614 and

723
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
12 and so my 12 year old.

724
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Jump time

725
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
And she loved it

726
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,472
Alright so so so she

727
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
She's jumping up and down this thing

728
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
And you realize

729
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
From that

730
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Maybe there's something to this

731
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
You know

732
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,064
When it comes to good ideas I believe you measure it by the reaction of the people you hope to sell

733
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,904
And it wasn't a kid in the neighborhood who didn't want to jump on

734
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Everybody came to your backyard

735
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Well anybody that we let in

736
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
And so you get caught up in the enthusiasm of your kids

737
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
2

738
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
When did diapers switch coffee

739
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Your mind were you

740
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
You thought okay

741
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
I meant

742
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
I need to pursue this because at this point

743
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
You sent $10,000

744
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
You did not have a business

745
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
The university didn't

746
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
You own this patent nothing you just had

747
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
One really great trampoline your backyard

748
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Yep

749
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
You had a prisoner a lot

750
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
To consider before you invest the money and buy this

751
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
YouTube

752
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Find out

753
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
How much wood ash

754
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Foxy costume

755
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Manufacturer

756
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
Is you have to model this out where this was going to be a viable business

757
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
Did you do that

758
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
We did

759
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
October 2002 we had

760
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Secure the paint

761
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,920
Effectively a letter-of-intent agreement-in-principle we had locked up some

762
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Some period of time

763
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,736
And first thing we did

764
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Was we went to the Super Show

765
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:22,208
In Las Vegas Nevada which is like a toy know it was used to be the Sporting Goods manufacturing association

766
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,048
This is a 2000 January of 2000

767
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
I went to see what the reaction

768
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Built wanted

769
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
Can you display that there we built one

770
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
We took a prominent

771
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Spotted

772
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,896
The show we hired some dancers from Siegfried and Roy 2BR jumpers along with my daughters

773
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,992
My youngest daughter and her three friends and we just said

774
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Like this is go big or go home

775
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Did you

776
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
How big

777
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
What is the trampoline

778
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Market

779
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,536
Well I would have said it was pretty small I think that we had measured that we thought the

780
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
But the trampoline Market

781
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
That maybe it was a five to six

782
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
600 million-dollar trampoline

783
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
Tea Market globally

784
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
So you were looking for

785
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Bite out of

786
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
5 / 600

787
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Diamond ever been greedy

788
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
A small business can be a good boy

789
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,200
I guess we took a philosophy internally which was to think big

790
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
But start small

791
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
And so we try

792
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,856
What was it what was the reaction at the show Awkward people say to

793
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
What was really quite amazing actually we had lots of different react

794
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,816
When's the first we had was from a retailer who came up and said will you can't sell this in America you don't have an enclosure

795
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
And I said will hold out an enclosure is in bed

796
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,472
Try this again but no retailer will sell a trampoline without an enclosure

797
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,544
I had somebody come up to me and said you know I have

798
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Patent

799
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
On the enclosure and you'll never sell this product in America

800
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Ever quote on the enclosure

801
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,064
And then I had the at the time the CEO from what was

802
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Very large Sporting Goods retailer come up to me and said you know this may be the most Innovative product we seen

803
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
The show in years

804
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:05,888
Seawalker that show and what are you thinking so I decided to in

805
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
Invest in some fundamental research and I wanted ask myself one question did any retailer in America

806
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
Believe the trampolines were dangerous

807
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
But they wouldn't answer.

808
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,416
The CEO of Costco was a man of Jim sinegal and Jim said I will not sell trampolines

809
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Wow

810
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
End

811
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
So

812
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
I made it my mission to try and sell Costco Tramp

813
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,840
Okay but before we get to Costco

814
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
So

815
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
At what point did you say alright I'm going in

816
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
We're going to get this we're going to buy the

817
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Traffic we are finished

818
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
I was advancing all of this

819
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
Very quickly I think contractually was all locked up I probably met of Oats

820
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
3

821
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
And what did it cost you

822
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
To be honest guy I wouldn't even remember the number

823
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
More than billion dollars

824
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Yes

825
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
More than willing.

826
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
Buy everything when everything was all said and done all the settlements

827
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
What is a Keith

828
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
You are a professor at the University

829
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
You come up with an invention they sell the patent

830
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
To Steve and

831
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
You get a check for

832
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
Yes the arrangement with the universe

833
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Was stuck

834
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
What do you eat pine wood

835
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
Facebook three wise

836
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
That was huge

837
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
I'm curious at this point did you

838
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
When did you have to deal with the fact that

839
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Answer right

840
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
Lights are sold to someone else in and now like

841
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Detestable

842
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Naked

843
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
That's right

844
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
That was

845
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
A very sobering

846
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
And I thought

847
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Yeah

848
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
Okay I guess that's the way it is

849
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
I guess I can let it go now

850
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
I don't feel like it but I guess that's the way it goes

851
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
Do the chick coming in

852
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
I've got to think about this

853
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
Alan Steve Steve

854
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm going to need a

855
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
A bit of a helping hand cuz I don't have any

856
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Trampoline engineer

857
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
Do you mind giving me a hand with this

858
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Give me some technical input

859
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Yeah yeah

860
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Fine okay

861
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Yeah and

862
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,936
And that came in fairness you know what Keith and I had a conversation once about risk and reward

863
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
So I asked

864
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,032
What level of risk are you willing to take

865
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Versus the

866
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Economic rewards you expect

867
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
And he said

868
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
I have

869
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
I don't want any rest

870
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah I want I don't want any red

871
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,368
We reached an agreement at that point as to what his role would be and how he would

872
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Be compensated

873
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
So it was good

874
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Pizza Steve you are

875
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Running a business

876
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
Canada and Keith you are

877
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Still in New Zealand

878
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Consulting on the

879
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
What was the next step

880
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
Well Keith Knight created the

881
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
Springfree enclosure

882
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,384
We kept looking at all of the principles of art design and said

883
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Better be soft

884
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:03,040
It can't be hard and everybody had produced enclosures with steel poles

885
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,904
We kept looking at this American Peyton and say we can't infringe this

886
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
So we didn't sell any products we didn't make any products we just spent a year building an enclosure for the spread for bread

887
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
Left that convention Las Vegas determine that you had to solve this problem

888
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
But if you were going to make this thing

889
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
As safe as possible

890
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
It had to be enclosed

891
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
That's it

892
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,360
And we decided that we would give ourselves a deadline

893
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
The deadline would be the January Super Show

894
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,016
Bealls in Orlando Florida in January of 04

895
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
2004 Super Show

896
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,904
What made the enclosure different how are you able to create this thing that

897
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
So Steve said now that a relation

898
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,560
Skip to the people that make people treated fiberglass

899
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
You've got to make the towels out of the

900
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Sign material

901
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
I'll see what they need to be strong enough to hold this meeting

902
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
We can try

903
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:03,200
Had a post-grad student needed some money so he's working in our backyard we got these 12 of these

904
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,600
Around the trampoline fitted on and tie the top of them together with with some cold let's see

905
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:16,000
See what happens first grade student

906
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Local fishermen people around the place you can get some Nation after that for days he come back with some fish

907
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,800
The last all day at the top of the bottom said it was Wallace like that

908
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
Enclosure and innocence different than the ones directly but it was this really flexible thing

909
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
So then when I came home from University and the kids was still on it that were bouncing off the walls

910
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
Running into it and bouncing off and I'm thinking hey this is really something we didn't expect

911
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,400
Can you play Sofia the other trampolines. Have we might a rubber room now this is white

912
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
It's not just the safety day this is another places

913
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
So you got the enclosed

914
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,664
Trampoline you're ready to introduce us to the world

915
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:10,784
2004 go to the Super Show in Orlando Florida

916
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
They had a competition there which was called the product of the Year basically

917
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,280
And if you got to a finalist or the top 10 you would be displayed in a specific area of

918
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
Super Show independent of your booth

919
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,936
So we made all the applications necessary and

920
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
We became final

921
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
This was the unveiling

922
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Springfree

923
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
This was it

924
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
And how did you do how many

925
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
What did you get the orders

926
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Well

927
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
We got One Import

928
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Buy Costco Canada

929
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Wow

930
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Excited okay if we do it in Canada that doesn't seems not as litigious they're all really nice people there they don't seem to sue each other maybe we'll

931
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Try it again

932
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,512
And they put a test in for an Essence it worked out that we put in a test

933
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
400

934
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
Let's try selling

935
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
400 unit

936
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:01,728
The first word was 400 pieces on a trial

937
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,104
And you see Rugby's first 400 units we made August 480 or 400

938
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Nadia think something like that in New Zealand

939
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
With one container

940
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,528
One container load was the retail price for

941
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,136
Drug that time the retail price we put it out to kannur was 999

942
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Just to just to

943
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Clarify something

944
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,304
This was at that time going to be one of the most

945
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Expensive trampolines right so it was a big risk

946
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,448
And you had to make the case that this was

947
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Worth the cost

948
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Yeah I mean our value proposition

949
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
We had that very first product

950
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Orlando is the same as what is to

951
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
Which is that we provide the world's safest trampoline we producing out of the highest quality materials we give the longest

952
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Warranty

953
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
10 year warranty on everything

954
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
It's still that today and that was what we kept selling on the retailer side

955
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
But you are selling them

956
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
900

957
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
99 bucks

958
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Aston Martin

959
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Fly costume

960
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
It was more than that

961
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
We were losing money on every Pro

962
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
We had to do that to find out if we

963
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Create a marker

964
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
All right so they roll them out and Costco

965
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
And how did they do

966
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,432
Move very fast very very fast

967
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
Jodi Duplantis second-order

968
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,832
Well because we've put it on a test and that was the spring of that year

969
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
The next recurring order wasn't going to really take

970
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
Play some filler neck Spring by which was 05

971
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,328
So that it was oh crap what do we do between now and then

972
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
Because you would

973
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,520
Generate some Revenue in New Zealand which is presently expensive

974
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
Transition right about that

975
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,664
We knew we couldn't continue as they were costing about 1400

976
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,760
$50 to make one to make one

977
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
And so we knew we couldn't continue in one of the things that I didn't realize at the Super Show in 20

978
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:02,560
AO3 2003 I said to you that I had people come up to me various things I'd an individual come out to me

979
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,424
With a business card who said I manufacture Sporting Goods in China

980
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
If you ever need a manufacturer call me

981
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
And

982
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,848
When we reach the stage with Costco at the end of before we said

983
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Okay we got Mexico

984
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,224
Which I have to assume was going to be

985
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Because it's going to reduce your costs.

986
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
Well here was the thing that was so critical to ashes the key scipy was

987
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
That was essential we had to make sure we could get intellectual property

988
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
Protection but the China everything

989
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Not everything

990
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
XVideos

991
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,936
Be careful and we had to be careful and the other thing is that the rods that

992
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
The keypad unwarily

993
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
They were all about technical know-how

994
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,872
So we weren't prepared to move that so even to this day

995
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Most of the original

996
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Manufacturing components

997
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
The rods

998
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
And the net

999
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Material

1000
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:58,112
Can we use we are using the exact same manufacturing partner

1001
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
They've come a long way.

1002
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Through the whole journey

1003
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
We've never deviate

1004
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,512
Or not but we moved

1005
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
All of the Steal

1006
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
100%

1007
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Out of the labor

1008
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
Associated with

1009
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Producing an assembly into China

1010
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Alright SUB-2000

1011
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
You got to wait till 2000

1012
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Five four

1013
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Big order

1014
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
How many people are on

1015
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Where I think at that point we

1016
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Between our Engineering Group

1017
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,456
Our sales teams

1018
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
We might have been 35

1019
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
And you're burning through cash

1020
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Yeah we were burning car

1021
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
We were hanging on

1022
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,208
No I was running my payables long we were hanging on for that

1023
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
Costco delivery

1024
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
In Spring 05

1025
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Soaps when Costco came back to

1026
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Spring of 05

1027
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,704
What code to be about 3265 p

1028
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
3002

1029
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
65 pieces

1030
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,384
Finance that right cuz it'll tell you first do they pay you like

1031
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,991
That's right so we we I hit the street and found

1032
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
Found somebody who

1033
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
Bought into a Costco.

1034
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,903
So so this is somebody in this is interesting this is somebody who

1035
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Looks

1036
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
For people like you who

1037
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
Get a get a purchase order from Costco

1038
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Need financing actually make

1039
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
The product and I'll loan you the money at a high interest

1040
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
The high interest rate

1041
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Yeah

1042
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
That was your life

1043
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,983
It was our Lifeline in it and it could be fairness

1044
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
To this day

1045
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
It is the reason we survived in store and thrive

1046
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
Even though that order along with

1047
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,991
Make it profitable you know you're a long road to go we weren't

1048
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
But but

1049
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
Prove that we

1050
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,975
Because Costco representative Mike bigger animal than just Canada we went from Costco Canada

1051
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
To Costco

1052
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
UK is UK was beautiful being safe we got to go from Costco Canada to Casa

1053
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Japan which made no sense to us we didn't really know what we're going to do in the pad but we end up selling 370 trampoline

1054
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
And then we got to go on Costco.com there eCommerce

1055
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:06,111
New platform for them not in store in 2007 I guess it was

1056
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
Costco is Pinellas point up until 2007 your biggest

1057
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:18,911
Contract virtually in in the Northern Hemisphere and then are only

1058
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:25,311
I we were selling Direct in places where we could but they were basically 90% of our distribution

1059
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
You are now in this thing 2008 please stop this

1060
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,271
Translate

1061
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
Did I was probably the hardest

1062
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
So what happened

1063
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
Is there as we got more and more and more

1064
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Successful with

1065
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
With the product and cost

1066
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Some of the buyers they were really proud

1067
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
So they would

1068
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Show off

1069
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
The product

1070
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
In a real

1071
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
Flamboyant where you don't have any

1072
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,495
Prominent position inside inside a Costco

1073
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
Mr. Senegal was

1074
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
He opened every cost

1075
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
Costco open

1076
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
And there was a big opening at Halifax Nova

1077
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Scotia on

1078
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
May 13th

1079
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
It was a Wednesday 09 never forget the date and it might be

1080
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
This is Chris

1081
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,719
And he'd gone to the store at the time he was still opposed

1082
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
Even though we are being really successful

1083
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
He was still uncomfortable

1084
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,911
And so what he walked in the Halifax store

1085
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
I got a phone call from the president at the

1086
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
The time of Canada Costco

1087
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
And they said

1088
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
We're done

1089
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,663
And they said we're done

1090
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:40,063
I said no no no I don't understand we're not how can we be done and then we just get the part guy which is

1091
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,463
In 2008 we decided to build their own Factory in China because we were satisfied with the quality so I invested

1092
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
$5000000 in building a Chinese Factory

1093
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,423
We did it because this was God's go we're going to be in store this was going to change the face of everything that's so weird

1094
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,823
We open that factory on October of 2008 and all in preparation for a

1095
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Pro 2009 with Costco and on the May 13th we were told we're done and it was just cuz they

1096
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,623
Play Gone overboard in that store that made the trampoline one of the single biggest highlights in this grand opening and how

1097
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Fun facts

1098
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,791
And he was just pissed because it was so

1099
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,327
Present invisible

1100
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
He walks in there it says

1101
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
What is the trampoline doing in the center of my Costco

1102
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,127
You really knew I think we were below the radar great numbers weirdo great numbers for sporting goods

1103
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
So I was told if you need to talk to mister

1104
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,759

I had to salvage

1122
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Spell the 16th of May

1123
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
It was a Saturday morning

1124
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
And when

1125
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
At 14 days

1126
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
Pio's took longer than that

1127
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
To get usually

1128
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Wow

1129
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
So what you do

1130
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
Where was really good business skills learning

1131
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:42,175
Session I step back and I said okay we have a product that has unbelievable safety

1132
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
The quality and innovation

1133
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
6 we have customers who love our products

1134
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
I mean

1135
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,647
Our best marketing is on existing Springfree cost

1136
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,975
Springfree customer has a Springfree Trampoline

1137
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
If a parent who says why I really don't like trampoline still sell it

1138
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:03,167
Each other friends and neighbors and 50% of our sales came from our customers so we said

1139
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,751
Wherever spring trees are in backyards we have to make

1140
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
It really easy

1141
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
In our biggest Market

1142
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
The time based on

1143
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Costco delivery address

1144
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
This was California

1145
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
MCI

1146
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
So we opened our own

1147
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,319
First Springfree retail store

1148
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
On the off ramp

1149
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Of the Costco has

1150
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
Insead

1151
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
In Seattle so Islands in mm

1152
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Well this is a late 2009

1153
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
So there you had

1154
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Showroom

1155
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Could try it

1156
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
Kids jumper

1157
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
We called it the we called it the Springfree experience

1158
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
And that store proved to be

1159
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Phenomenal

1160
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Only successful

1161
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
We were blowing the doors off the profit

1162
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:50,271
And we're just going like there was I think there was very few retail stores that were doing

1163
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,879
The profit per square foot that we were doing out of that store at store

1164
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,655
Sell these things like this we are great dealer Network we established

1165
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,007
Quick as we could in the US they had trampolines on Parade floats

1166
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:16,895
They went to every Fair they went to every neighborhood they connected with the communities because we knew where we had ship

1167
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
We had we had these weather it was a pop-up store or whether it was a permanent experience Center we went

1168
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
The consumers we went out there we'd the shows we had the stores and show that there was a business model which was

1169
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
Different than Costco

1170
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
So we took a direct-to-consumer model and we use Keith as the face of the organization

1171
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
So he was the one who conveyed

1172
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
The story

1173
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:47,103
The the attributes and the commitment to safety and quality silkie

1174
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,943
So all the sudden like you've got to represent this

1175
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
Product right to the world

1176
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
The media interviews

1177
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Letv

1178
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,111
You are a self-described introvert

1179
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,695
I Can Only Imagine

1180
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Yeah

1181
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,535
Hey yeah you're right you're right Steve

1182
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Did give me warning

1183
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
He said what would you like to be the Dyson

1184
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
3

1185
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
What are the two mean

1186
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,727
Would you know Dawson Dawson vacuum cleaners

1187
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
Sewing head looking this

1188
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
Dawson doing his thing I thought

1189
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
I suppose I could do then

1190
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,503
If I come across well you know maybe they can use it maybe it'll help with selling so

1191
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
I said yes.

1192
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
So then he says Rockville

1193
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Come to Toronto

1194
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
We got to have a week

1195
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
And we can

1196
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Filming

1197
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
And I'm thinking

1198
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
But this is big deal this is not just

1199
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
102 little

1200
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Afternoon

1201
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,423
Choose one of the scariest weeks of my life.

1202
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
So end up

1203
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
In Toronto

1204
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
In this big Studio

1205
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
And find myself with

1206
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
3 cameras

1207
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
And lights

1208
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
People around

1209
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,735
Microphones in front of me and I said what we just talk

1210
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
And you didn't

1211
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Cytokine NSA

1212
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,695
Will you come across really genuine you know you

1213
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
You really come across well

1214
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
And how did it come out

1215
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Phenomenal

1216
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
It was okay and you didn't

1217
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,447
I mean it sounds like you were actually

1218
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
Expanding pretty fat

1219
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,895
Yeah we're over 400 employees

1220
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:31,295
Oregon expands to that number of employees years before that

1221
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,599
Costco pulls out

1222
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
You know

1223
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
Sometimes you do stupid things

1224
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
What we did is

1225
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,559
We decided to cook on home and Costco pulled out but we actually went deeper

1226
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,631
So we increased our commitment in the factory

1227
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
China we increased our Direct

1228
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Strategy we increased our ability to open and direct retail stores to raise money

1229
00:50:54,335 --> 00:51:00,479
Fortunately enough we had we have been reasonably wise

1230
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,879
We've been saving for those expansion opportunities and rainy days so we needed to raise I would probably

1231
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
Invested maybe 5 to 7 million dollars in the factory Construction in a couple more million into

1232
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Dollar stores

1233
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,703
I think we had a debt raised in about time $3000000

1234
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:27,103
Even maybe two thousand ten years but we didn't stop investing the car said like

1235
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,479
This is that risk we kept thinking that that opportunity to big big opportunity was

1236
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:38,879
When did you start to see that life 2010-2011

1237
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:45,279
2011 to 2013 were phenomenal years for us within the global.

1238
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,095
Will I get lots of credits Keith

1239
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
His design was

1240
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Always flowers

1241
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,471
So that issue of safety that we kept talking about

1242
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
We now had

1243
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
8 years of experience

1244
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:03,199
So instead of saying we're the world's safest trampoline but we've only sold 2,000 you know we were actually saying we've got a couple hundred

1245
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Thousand trampolines out there and

1246
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
We actually have some

1247
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,831
Statistics now in key started writing research papers and

1248
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Have a measuring RC

1249
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
Statistics and we were going you know

1250
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,463
We remove 90% of the

1251
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Product related injury

1252
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
So

1253
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,631
He's taking his designers remove 90% so we got that message out

1254
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
Kiss videos in the way we distributed them

1255
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
And we got traction

1256
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
And we got real traction

1257
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
How much how much does a

1258
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,359
Springfree Trampoline cost

1259
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,943
Where are we having six different sizes fit ranges anywhere

1260
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,039
I'm probably yes 1602 $2,400 so this is

1261
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Premium Prada

1262
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Very

1263
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
Make for a while

1264
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
Yeah Keith always said that whenever he put a Springfree into somebody's backyard and I've agreed with them and we've continued that it should be.

1265
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
That's it they should pay the money

1266
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
It should go in the backyard.

1267
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
Zero maintenance cost

1268
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
And there should be

1269
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
0

1270
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,263
It support Costco in other words

1271
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
If they got a problem

1272
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,103
We back at so we have a 10-year warranty on

1273
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
The whole bra

1274
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
And how are you selling

1275
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
On average in a year

1276
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:14,623
You know we look at that you know are probably 30,000 is our annual volume and and we build our business Ma

1277
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:20,255
All around that we've had years that have gone much higher and we've had some years it a little lower to based on some of the economics

1278
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,119
I mean we open the factory 2008 we lost Costco and there's a global financial crisis

1279
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
Cuz I can tell you that wasn't the best year

1280
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
Yeah I'm so weak we had a tough

1281
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,031
You want me to talk to you that might have been a 18000 piece year

1282
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,103

1306
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
So do you

1307
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671

To belie

1309
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
Lucky that

Intelligence in and hard work

1313
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Why don't nobody

1314
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
The Intelligencer

1315
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
But

1316
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
Due respect

1317
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
For the employees of organization

1318
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
And for my wife

1319
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
And my kids who suffer

1320
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,199
To the early days this is been about hard work

1321
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
I was very poor

1322
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
Fortunate to meet Doctor

1323
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Keith Alexander

1324
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
But being fortunate was

1325
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
What about a lifelong friend that I got

1326
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
And Keith what are you like

1327
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671

Prodigy

1331
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,815
Persistence and perseverance and Grit

1332
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,119
It's it's both of those

1333
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,703

Very persistent

1337
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,615
Otherwise I like to think of it

1338
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:50,015
For me the invention process as my part of it is that it's it's like having a child

1339
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,415
Conception is quite exciting and he is that eventually it

1340
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:02,815
Stuff to make people of all the time and then you get lice control this list control and

1341
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:09,215
Booyah child meats and where they go and how they grow up it's not very much can you control it all as Allah

1342
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,615
Roblox

1343
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015

How you go back

1364
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,943
Is it a story starts in the winter of 2015

1365
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,527
Cindy heilman just move to Toledo Ohio

1366
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,903
Twitter husband Chris grew up in Sydney was having a hard time just feeling super

1367
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,487
Almost like depressed about the winter

1368
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Florida

1369
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,583
To Ohio is kind of bit of a culture shock

1370
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
So gloomy

1371
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Being from Florida

1372
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,703
Cindy needed warmth and Light

1373
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:51,103
And lots of candles which meant lots of leftover candle containers

1374
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,967
If they were in glass jars I would hold on to them

1375
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,295
In a cabinet we buy candles and say okay this is an early night

1376
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
IPod with music

1377
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,415
What are Q-tips and we can use it for something around the house

1378
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,487
Ceramic containers I would normally put a plant in it

1379
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
And we have

1380
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Tons of houseplant

1381
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
This went on for two Winters

1382
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Cold weather

1383
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Candles

1384
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Candle containers

1385
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,495
By March of 2017 there was one big change

1386
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,079
Cindy had become a stay-at-home mom which was great

1387
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
Except for the weather

1388
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,223
So one day the friend sent her a card to cheer up I was wondering why I had

1389
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
Somebody like little

1390
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Boxing.

1391
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,599
Onnit those bumps and dots were actually seeds

1392
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,415
They were embedded in the paper and instead of

1393
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
Rolling the cart away

1394
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Cindy could soak it in water

1395
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Put it in a

1396
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,303
Planter and grow wildflowers

1397
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,375
I just thought it was the coolest thing ever

1398
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
And

1399
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,447
I must have felt lucky to happen

1400
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:53,823
The same time City found a bluish gray planter pot and she really wanted to use it

1401
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
Oh I can put some candle wax

1402
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,895
Finesse and

1403
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,223
Just try and make a candle she said hey

1404
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
You tell these

1405
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,063
And I got to do the math my head is like that's going to have to be

1406
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,879
$30 can I pay $30 for handle

1407
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:13,535
You just bought me a $30 candle last week another idea

1408
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,351
They can make a candle in a planter pot

1409
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
And then

1410
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,935
Use that paper with the seeds embedded in it

1411
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:25,823
For the label people be able to grow wildflowers after they're done with the container so they don't have to throw it away

1412
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,359
So they got to work

1413
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,967
We had no idea what we're doing we're just watching a bunch of YouTube videos

1414
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Different

1415
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,575
Pinterest ideas on DIY how to make a

1416
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,903
Handle 2 months of melting wax all over based

1417
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
Cindy figured it out

1418
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:46,047
And then Chris said okay we think it's a good idea but will it actually

1419
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
Sell so they went to a trade show to find out

1420
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
I was really Blown Away by

1421
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,751
How emotionally invested people got into our product

1422
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
A lot of

1423
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
The guys

1424
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,615
They would have their girl with them like this is so cool product isn't it

1425
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:04,479
Do you want one and that day they sold every single one of their candles and

1426
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
Covered all their expenses

1427
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:12,415
And made $8,000 profit is also a couple days worth of work and that was enough reason for Krista

1428
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
To consider quitting his banking job because Chris and Cindy have been thinking about starting a business together for years

1429
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,631
So we were in a really good financial position to be able to

1430
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:28,031
Take this type of Step so it really didn't feel very risky toss at all until Chris left his job and join.

1431
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Cindy in their basement

1432
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,151
They took $4,000 out of their savings to buy waxwing

1433
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,943
Pots and see paper

1434
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,991
In the 850

1435
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Candles

1436
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,855
Amber 5 months at more than a dozen trade shows they sold

1437
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
Every single one of them

1438
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,487
I mean it's backbreaking work going to these trade shows every weekend because

1439
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:53,887
Remember we don't have weekend working really long days and then we get back it's okay we have to make a ton of candles so we can beer

1440
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
Rate for next week of the next event

1441
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,263
Over the past year Chris and Cindy moved their business online

1442
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
$50,000 loan to

1443
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Scale-up

1444
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,639
They hired some employees and even move their little

Candle making factory out of their basements

1446

Is married business partners

1447
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,063
They're still struggling to find the right balance

1448
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,391
Having a business out of her home for the past year has been a huge

1449
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Difference

1450
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:22,559
