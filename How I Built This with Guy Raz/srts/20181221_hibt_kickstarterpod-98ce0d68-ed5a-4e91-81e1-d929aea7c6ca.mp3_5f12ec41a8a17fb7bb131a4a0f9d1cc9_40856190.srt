Okay now on today's show

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
If you happen to be planning a

14
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,976
Brand new project or launching a new idea in the new year

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,048
You might get some inspiration for my interview with Terry Chen

16
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,864
Kickstarter in 2009

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
A year later

18
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
I made it one of the best inventions

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Xavier

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
This episode first ran in July of

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Last year

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Enjoy

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
But I think there's also like we could have tried

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
To go any faster there's just not that much was in our control we didn't have a lot of money we didn't have a lot of info

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
A lot of connections so we're moving as fast as we could and and that's kind of his that's as much as

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
You can do

27
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,128
From NPR how I built this

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movement

29
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
How Perry Chad build Kickstarter and was it a culture of crowdfunding ideas

30
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,168
Might have never gotten off the ground

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,616
You know there's a kind of mythical narrative around

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
Startups especially if we're talking about tech startups and

33
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
It goes something like this

34
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Founder has an idea

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,672
Ben founder recruit some friends than friends sit in a room and start writing code

36
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,560
And then they try to get the app or the website out to the world as fast as possible and then

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
It just explodes blows up

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
Millions of customers sign up and investors.

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
Beating down the door

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
But today

41
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
We have a somewhat different story

42
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
This is the story of Kickstarter and they did of course

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Start with an idea

44
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,248
But it'll be years before that idea

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Became a reality

46
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
The three co-founders did build a website but

47
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
None of them knew had a code

48
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,000
And he spent years refining the concept before anything even went live

49
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
And they were working with a very small amount of money

50
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
It's a path Less Traveled exam

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Much less likely to 6

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
It's not how I would recommend anybody

53
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Attempt to do this

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
This is Perry Chen what are the co-founders of

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Kickstarter

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Harry grew up in New York City

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
We went to college in New Orleans where he was really into the local music and art scene

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
And after he graduated he

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
Came back home

60
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
To me you are counting like a lot of college graduates

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
I didn't know what he wanted to do

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
But he knew one thing

63
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
He needed to find work

64
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,888
I came back to New York and at the time I've been DJing a bunch of New Orleans and I start to work on my music

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
I applied some record labels like you know

66
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Send my resume

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,104
To whatever the worst job they have is where you like you're just stacking CDs on the Shelf

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Yeah but you're opening box

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Stacking City

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
And

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Of course I never heard back

72
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,600
Answer that that didn't happen I don't think I had any idea and then I heard from somebody that they said that

73
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,672
A guy we know what school was looking for Warm Bodies

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
To do what

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
2 Above All Things

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Day trade

77
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Did you know anything about

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Nothing

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
Nothing he just needed people to what to show up and do like

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Click buttons

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,848
Yeah you know I think at this time in early 99

82
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
What's kind of the Wild

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
X yeah stock market

84
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
And

85
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
So I went down I talk to him

86
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
10 minutes

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
Kayla going to be like an office and then had no it was like a large room

88
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
You know it was like a open floor before dressing like jeans and t-shirt and you know mostly

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Guys mostly under 40

90
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
And you know he talked to me and he's like okay fine you know he's like

91
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
You coming you know will trade you

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
For 5 days

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Then you just go trade will put a small amount of money on your account you just trade nothing no clients not telling me anything

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
It's just this guy's money he's like if you

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Do well you know you'll get

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Some of that and if

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
If you don't

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Just don't worry about it and then you know

99
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
That's it

100
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Yeah they were like you got it was something

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Play Modest like $2,500 a month you know

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,607
I mean listen it was you. Beggars can't be choosers I was like sure what happened

103
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
Was literally just get sat down in front of a computer and

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,335
Sitting there by yourself and you can buy or sell stuff you were basing your decisions on like

105
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,967
What I'm reading the Wall Street Journal or no not at all I mean you're buying and selling something and in a minute

106
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
Oahu or 5 minutes or holding it you don't

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
You might not necessarily know the name of the company

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
It was like a combination of

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Mario Brothers

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
And surface which I've never done but looking out in the ocean I assume and I see a way of coming so you're like okay

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,143
It's simple it's a little distinction

112
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
And

113
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
I did it for maybe

114
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,079
Little less than two years or so did you walk away from it with some

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Wilson cash

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,455
Yeah it was a little bit I mean nothing crazy but definitely decent for

117
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Somebody in their 20s

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
But you know after while I mean I was kind of like

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
What am I doing you know I'm not doing anything I'm not helping any

120
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
Sing me the best what I'm doing is neutral let me know my selling somebody on it

121
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
I think so

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
The traitors like to think that there

123
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
Providing liquidity from great service but

124
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
You know it's it's

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
You're doing

126
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
Nothing you're shuffling some numbers from one computer to another

127
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
So

128
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
Yes I had to go back to normal and it's much cheaper than New York

129
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,711
My intent was to just kind of really focus on working on music to get better as a as a producer

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
And kind of

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Pick up jobs here and there if I needed it

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
Did the idea of Kickstarter

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Come to you

134
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
At that time

135
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
I think so I think it was

136
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
I was a late 2001 early 2002 because to be honest

137
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
You know I can't remember but

138
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
You know what New Orleans jazz festival is kind of bored of

139
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
The two big breaks the year that right now other than Mardi Gras

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
So I wanted to throw a show

141
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Where I was going to bring in these this to

142
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Electronic artists

143
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
From Austria

144
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Critter endorf

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
See that you fly them

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
From

147
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
Vienna to New Orleans and have them do a gig

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,439
Sure I mean you know the hope is that though they would just happen to be in Mississippi

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,071
Yes I mean I was not an event promoter so this is all just kind of on the Fly

150
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
But

151
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
It didn't happen

152
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
And

153
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
It just kind of bother me

154
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
It why is it that

155
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
I would need to

156
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
Come up with the money and make this decision that this thing would

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Have enough people,

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
I thought

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
What if the people that

160
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
Would want to come to the show could have a say in that

161
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
And if

162
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Enough people

163
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
Could do that before a certain point then show can happen

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
And if not

165
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
10

166
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Prince about

167
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
That was it that was the beginning and

168
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
And

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
What I remember most is that like

170
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,447
Are good ideas all the time and and you know but within a little thinking you're going to find the Fatal flaw

171
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,287
And so what struck me most about it was like

172
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Confined

173
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Edits so it stuck with

174
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
And so I kind of

175
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Had this feeling I was like this is

176
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
This may be something

177
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
No after that feeling I was like okay

178
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Cool

179
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Impacts of regular life

180
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Music

181
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
And

182
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Being in New Orleans

183
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Riding my bike

184
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
It's a good life like see your friends from high school or college

185
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Coffin and start

186
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Lake careers in

187
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Laguna Clara Finance anything

188
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
Yeah yeah maybe I should go into a career

189
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
No I mean you know what I felt was

190
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
I'm living in New Orleans

191
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
I'm working on music

192
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
This is why people work for 35 years

193
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Retire

194
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
So they can look through my New Orleans working music

195
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
So

196
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
Am I jealous of my friend who works

197
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
70 hours a week

198
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
No

199
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
All right so you are so you're in New Orleans

200
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Your

201
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,727
Doing different things you had this idea that sort of comes and goes

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
And I guess around 2005 you move

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Back to New York

204
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Yes exactly in May of 2005

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
What was the reason why you moved back

206
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
I think it was a lot of things I mean I think that

207
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
Partially because I was

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Moving

209
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Away from music a little bit

210
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
I was kind of fighting with it

211
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
You know what

212
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
A lot of times we have an idea right and you can

213
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
How to put on the shelf of your brain

214
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Some people say something at certain points in a remind you

215
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Yes I think that's kind of what happened

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
As I was getting close to probably in the final year of new orleans's getting

217
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Close to come back to New York maybe one year and a half

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
I think I came back anymore

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
I I knew that I was

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Pepper soup

221
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
You knew that you were going to

222
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Prestigious idea to educated come back to you

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,063
Yeah part of the reason being to is that in New Orleans it would have been pointless

224
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
You know I don't know of any

225
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Tech Community

226
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
I was there

227
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
In the early 2000s it might have been

228
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Certainly I wasn't

229
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
So yeah it was my plan A

230
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
When I bet went back to New York

231
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Well

232
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
I got a job

233
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
Working at a restaurant in in Brooklyn that actually

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
Yeah you used to love you were a waiter there

235
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,527
And you know I'm at UNC after I've been at the restaurant for a little bit

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,599
Music of time

237
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
You would come in

238
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
We chatted a bit and we were like talking music and

239
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,791
Baseball in and then we just hung out a few times and end

240
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
Pretty early on we hung out maybe the second time or third time I kind of shared with him that I was working on this idea

241
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
His reaction when you told him you said so brilliant idea

242
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
What's funny that that was not the reaction

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,711
I mean it wasn't it wasn't the extreme opposite but he is like I'm not sure

244
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,831
So I don't know if my thought of time with that would be working together but I thought

245
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
If it worthwhile to

246
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Talk to him

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,791
And as we started talking more and more about it and simultaneously becoming better and better friends

248
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
I think we

249
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
It just come naturally came together and started to work together

250
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
Holding orbit how to build a website or or anything like that

251
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
Well I certainly didn't throw any technical sense

252
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
I cannot code and I couldn't code

253
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
But I think I

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
How to send of

255
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
What a Feeling

256
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,695
I know what I like I know what I think feels good when I'm on a side

257
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
But

258
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
From the deep technical stuff

259
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
No

260
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
That was not my background at all Yancey probably have been closer but

261
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Is not a color

262
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
So what did you start

263
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
To do at that point to meet you dope and head first

264
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
This idea and

265
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
And what were you doing during the day

266
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Yeah it was head first

267
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
I mean I was reading blogs

268
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
On the internet

269
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Bye

270
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
People who

271
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Has started

272
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Internet companies

273
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
I was reading about it

274
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
And maybe finding a friend or friend of a friend and you don't plan to give me telephone to talk to somebody

275
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
And I didn't

276
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
It was slow going

277
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
But you can learn a lot by just kind of

278
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Google

279
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
HP Connected to two you have a third co-founder Charles Adler

00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
Work together kind of like almost everyday or every weekday

292
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Couple months

293
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,031
Your hand drawing like what the said look like Man drawing or 12 go into Photoshop or illustrator in

294
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Kind of like

295
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
You know just rough

296
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Mock up stuff

297
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
You're getting into detail like

298
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Here's a button

299
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Here's a

300
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
A video

301
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
This is what happens when you click list

302
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
A real in-depth

303
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
I think at the end reproduce a document of Iran

304
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Pages about how the sight words

305
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
0 code

306
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
What was it what were you doing who are you making this

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
What were you making this represent

308
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Investors or we just

309
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
Which is something that you guys would have

310
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
This was to make

311
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
This was not for Annabeth

312
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
This was just

313
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
You know what we would use

314
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
When we

315
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Had the money to

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Higher

317
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Developers to

318
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
To build it

319
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
But this is kritika

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Call you know you got to know what

321
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
This is the

322
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
The blueprint

323
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
When did you guys get investors

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
For money

325
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
It was in 2006

326
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Add friend of mine

327
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
And her cousin is David Cross

328
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,999
The comedian from Arrested Development mr. show

329
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Great stuff

330
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
And so she connected us

331
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
And we went and had a drink at a bar tonight and I talked to him at the idea and a few months later he invested

332
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
A little bit of money and that was our first investor and you know

333
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
Two and a half more years for free of the lock the website

334
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
From your other early investors in 2006

335
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,951
I took a year-and-a-half so from that point probably from there too early 2008 we were maybe

336
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,095
$120,000 in a year and a half of the money you had

337
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
To basically pay for server space or whatever you need to do to find a developer code

338
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
All these people

339
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
I think you know

340
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
At first like the working title for years in my mind was critical

341
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Because it was very much of the mechanism of life

342
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
When you reach a critical mass of

343
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Support

344
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Then I think.

345
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
Yeah but you know I think

346
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Imessage using a lot of things

347
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
This Thursday

348
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Bicycle organization in NJ

349
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
It's really good mechanical

350
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
In Owasso

351
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
I think you guys been together

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Grueling process

353
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Prezi what domain you can get

354
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,175
And yeah and then came out with this and

355
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Was able to get the domain for pretty cheap

356
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Tell me what the business model was from the

357
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
Are the idea was exactly as you today which is charged

358
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Amalfi

359
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
If and only if the project was funded so

360
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
You know if a product and get funded the other new listing for you so

361
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,399
We would get nothing you would have this platform

362
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
People would put their projects up if it's funded

363
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
You guys get a cut what's up percentage cut

364
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
5%

365
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
Soak City tickets are we at 5% if it's not funded

366
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
You get nothing

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Yeah

368
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
What's interesting about your story which is very different from a lot of other

369
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Tech companies is

370
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,207
You didn't just like get to a minimally viable product like in 6 months

371
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
Have it up and running like this

372
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
At least 3 years

373
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
Yeah I mean to be a two-and-a-half 3 years but very different from

374
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
More classical stories were it's like a couple of friends who worked in the industry who

375
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
May have connections or they can build it themselves

376
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
I don't think any of us had a sense of

377
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Where the end of the road was or where the goal was

378
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,551
Who went when the three of you like when you can see and Charles and you would would serve

379
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
Title the people in your life and you would say

380
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
I'm working on this and I'm trying to do this website and then you would see them again 6 months later

381
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,375
Come along do you think people were skeptical or or whatever

382
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,239
You learn what it feels like to be a documentary filmmaker

383
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Or or a writer you know it's like you still working on the book I'm sure people thought that and I wouldn't blame them I'm a

384
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
It was long in the tooth for us certainly to

385
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,295
Aren't you getting stressed out that somebody else is going to

386
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Beach just punch in and do the same thing

387
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
I think that's certainly comes to mind

388
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
But I think there's also like

389
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
We could have tried to go any faster there was just

390
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Not that much was in our control

391
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
We didn't have a lot of money we didn't have a lot of influence

392
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
A lot of connections

393
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
We're moving as fast as we could and that's kind of his

394
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
That's as much as you can do

395
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Why do you think you guys stuck with it

396
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Intersecting

397
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
People wouldn't normally lose patience right

398
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,087
So was it just that connection between the three of you guys like each other was at the idea or was just like

399
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
You just stuck it out

400
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
I think it was the idea

401
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
You have so many things don't have access

402
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,583
There aren't Industries or investors whatever set up around fun things

403
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Market Minot besides me

404
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,007
And then even the things the market might be sizeable enough to deal you have to make to do that

405
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
You might have to contort your idea and something

406
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
That starts enough

407
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
What your idea anymore

408
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Yeah or you just happen to have money

409
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Like this can't be the only way that

410
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Ideas can get

411
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
I think we saw it

412
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
You know

413
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Sometimes you just see it

414
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
I guess you're not always right

415
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
But just seeing it

416
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Is really critical and so

417
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
And where was changing over these years

418
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
It only made us

419
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
See that what we're building made more sense

420
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Not less than

421
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
That was Morenita

422
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Did not last if you would

423
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Engage with it more easily

424
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
With the rise of social media with the rise of YouTube

425
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Not laugh

426
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
And so

427
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,111
And of course is luck involved that that was Rising as we were

428
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
Taking our sweet time

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,279
Getting it going when we come back

430
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
Opportunities Kickstarter had to grow into a much bigger company

431
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
NY Perry Chen decided not to pursue any of them

432
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,055

Play Welcome Back to how I built this from NPR guy Raz

462
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,743
So as Perry and his co-founders continue to make

463
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Slow progress on Kickstarter

464
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
Competitors began to appear

465
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
In fact 18 months before Kickstarter went live Indiegogo another crowdfunding site

466
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Was launched

467
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
I'm just wondering how you were able to

468
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,455
Withstand the uncertainty of it all day

469
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,855
Your recollection makes it sound like you were just sort of like yeah you know whatever will this is my thing and I have a plan B and

470
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
I want to do this but I mean

471
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
Most people I think wouldn't feel that way

472
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Why they would feel

473
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Anxiety

474
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
About the uncertainty of

475
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Do you think that you're just wired differently

476
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
I mean I felt a tremendous

477
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Gladiator

478
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
But it wasn't that excited with driving me

479
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
And

480
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
I think it normalized

481
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
Just a little bit over time

482
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
One of the things I noticed

483
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Not just as weird

484
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
Triangle on butt after we had launched that

485
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Those years were so trying

486
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,135
That I kind of had to learn to adjust a kind of like stay in the middle

487
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,719
Hey you're not to get too high or too low because I think that will happen like

488
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,559
Somebody might invest small amount of money and we be like super site

489
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
You know

490
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Or

491
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
Hey we found a developer wants to work with us or whatever these little things like

492
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Get super excited

493
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Okay. Going to happen

494
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:03,103
And then something happens where that doesn't come and you look down and I think that

495
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Happened so many times

496
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Ups and downs

497
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,039
That I think it just kind of maybe my defense mechanism

498
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Who's kicked in tonight

499
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
Force me to stay a bit more in the middle

500
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
Either way right what's the name of steamed amazing happened or what

501
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Maybe sign that seemed IRL

502
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
I was about to occur

503
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,864
So what was the thing I mean it was almost three years in the time that you form a company to

504
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
The time of the website actually launch what was that

505
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
Who's at Rainbow and what enabled you to actually make this thing

506
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
Go live and become a reality

507
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Well I think that

508
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
In some ways we made every mistake in the book

509
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
So kind of food that we did one laugh that way

510
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Classic stuff like

511
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
People with experience telling us

512
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
You know you shouldn't do something

513
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
This way

514
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
And us being like well

515
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
We appreciate that but like you know

516
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
It'll be different for us and then of course

517
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Like exactly what I said happened

518
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
More like duh

519
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
And so I think we had got a little experience after few years

520
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,960
Then there's just people you know we found amazing people

521
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
One of the people we met

522
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Was Andy Baio

523
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
Who really helped us kind of

524
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Figure out

525
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,712
What kind of Technology we should be using and help us interview the developers that we

526
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
Would hire and given to become a 1st CT

527
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
That was tremendously help

528
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Because none of us could

529
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
Review the code that we were

530
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,952
The developers were on the right track

531
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
So that was that was really critical those things kind of

532
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Coming together

533
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,864
When do you launch the day you launch

534
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
How did you get the word out of people even

535
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Find

536
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
I think you're leading up to when we actually

537
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Knew you were going to lunch or believe

538
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Are we even talking to people about it

539
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Telling people you know

540
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Honestly we had to try to build up

541
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,320
Projects collage on the side as well so there would that Outreach leading up to the lodge

542
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Thunder albums

543
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Whatever their projects were

544
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
And I think we launched with Jenna maybe 5 or 10

545
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Projects

546
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
The first week

547
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
Did you remember what were those projects for

548
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,448
I think the first one might have been

549
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
Drawing $4

550
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Which may be raised

551
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
10 or $15

552
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,872
Do you just contributed a Kickstarter campaign to that person

553
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Draw whatever

554
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
You know I can't recall whether it was that they were making a specific drawing but as part of a reward. You gay if I were $10

555
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
But they would also make one for you

556
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
But it was great

557
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
I mean it's amazing see anything

558
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
I backed that project

559
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Launch go on with our friend Claudia

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
The first as well which is cool New York makes a book

561
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
Which was trying to get people to give $30

562
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,472
And everybody who did we get a book and page in the book just a minute

563
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
Whatever material they want to

564
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Another page

565
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
And did Kickstarter make money

566
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
By the way like with a fees

567
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Funny project

568
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
The first 6 months I think was free

569
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
You know people don't even know what this is you know how much can you ask them to

570
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Pay money

571
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
Do people notice

572
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Right away

573
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:01,280
Realize it was successful or was it still kind of underground in the shadows

574
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
What's the beginning

575
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
It was a very

576
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
Steady and I say that in the sense that it

577
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Weird things on the internet

578
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
I think we sometimes have this feeling of

579
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
Oh my God one day just

580
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Handling people

581
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Study Island

582
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
It wasn't like

583
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
I know it was like the first

584
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Wait there was 10 project in second week there was 20 in

585
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
The third week there was 30

586
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
You know what time does exponential thing but it was really nice and steady and

587
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
People got it

588
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
We have to go through a long. We're like

589
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Like nobody guess this

590
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
We have to like change the whole bunch thing

591
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,144
But it wasn't also like oh my God we have to hire

592
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
20 people tomorrow

593
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
I think we're very fortunate

594
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
You know we're able to

595
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
Hire like one person a month

596
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Maybe

597
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Maybe even less than that

598
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
So we could kind of

599
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Build a culture

600
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Because it's not one that you come in

601
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Which is

602
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
It's hard it's hard

603
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
To maintain something

604
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
So as you guys in that first year as you started to cut open up

605
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
And allow anybody to to raise

606
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,072
You know money for the project what kind of projects are you getting

607
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:12,192
I mean it's you know it's amazing depth of the human imagination you know like tattooing

608
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
As well

609
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
You know anything you can think of

610
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
School plays

611
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Albums concert

612
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
People who

613
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Wanting to fund their residencies

614
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
Books A lot of people doing projects to

615
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Probably

616
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Weren't doing projects

617
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,440
Had ideas in this was an outlet for them like a format for them a lot of really Whimsical stuff

618
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
Podcast it was amazing to say it was really heartwarming I just loved it I loved it

619
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
I guess after the launch went out and saw.

620
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,824
Money from Big names in the in the Venture Capital world like

621
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
Chris sacca and Ann in others

622
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,712
How did you what were the terms that you gave them was there was there any

623
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,808
Because once you do that you start to lose control and end

624
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:05,952
Those investors they want the other one exit strategy they want to know how quickly they're going to make money after

625
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
So how were you able to

626
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
Attract investors and avoid

627
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
That trap

628
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,656
I think going into it we knew that we weren't

629
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
Building this to sell this and we weren't trying to

630
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Credit public company

631
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
And

632
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
When we went out for investment this was

633
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
You know one of the first things we discussed

634
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
First of all

635
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
With Chris sacca it was angelmon

636
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
It was their personal

637
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
And that was kind of

638
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Purposeful

639
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
You know I think

640
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
That they can say hey

641
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,440
Cool you guys want to do your thing and you're not going to try to eat the world

642
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
And

643
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
We're done with that

644
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
Anzar on money and it's not that much

645
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
So it's very different I think than a lot of

646
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
Venture funding we did have one actual

647
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Venture

648
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Investor

649
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Again not that much money

650
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
You need to raise money to

651
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,616
Presumably Tire people into expand pics

652
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Yeah it's a

653
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Can I actually just tell her that you in a modest even a tiny modest one

654
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
Getting a salary at all

655
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,696
No I thought you know I think that there was some sort of

656
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Irregular

657
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Redoubt

658
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
3000 bucks a month

659
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
Pure there for me and maybe me or Charles

660
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,376
But

661
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Yeah we're getting ready to charge your money at the

662
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Sports there's no guarantee of

663
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
That continuing

664
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
For very long in your first year after launch what

665
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
What was your salary

666
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Either 60 or 6

667
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Thousand dollars

668
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Yeah

669
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
So at what point did Kickstarter

670
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Become profitable

671
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
I think you know the first 6 months

672
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Not at all no Revenue

673
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
I think we've been

674
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
A year after that

675
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Spy within the first date

676
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Regarding the block

677
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
And you were the CEO

678
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
I was

679
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
And how did you

680
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
I guess

681
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
You as

682
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Kickstarter became more popular

683
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
A lot of

684
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,360
Companies that were making some gadgets and

685
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Mustangs

686
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,456
We're using to Kickstarter as a way to cut

687
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Prototype

688
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
There

689
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,880
They're saying that was out there some companies raising millions of dollars

690
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
I guess that at a certain point you guys just had enough

691
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
We're not doing this anymore and you

692
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
The quote that I read that you gave was we're not a store you kind of

693
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,192
Stopped allowing Kickstarter to be used as a platform for for these kinds of things right

694
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Well it's

695
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,312
It's not different entirely accurate I mean basically what happened was that

696
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
We created

697
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Additional

698
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Process

699
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
4

700
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Product design

701
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Projects

702
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
And

703
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
They had more of a review process

704
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
And other project maybe more classical

705
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Creative areas

706
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Like an album

707
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
I didn't

708
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
And that was really because

709
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
You know we saw that

710
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Do the danger of people

711
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Kind of approaching

712
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
Kickstarter and things are being put up there

713
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,496
Like a new product as I'm buying this like I'm buying something on Amazon

714
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
I'm like I was going to come exactly the date that they're saying and

715
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
We felt that that needs to be understood

716
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
That Pixar is not a store

717
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
If you support a short film

718
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
You don't expect this

719
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Short film to be the best short film you ever saw

720
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
Right I want you by like a gadget

721
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
People can have

722
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
More of a consumer expect

723
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
So we said hey

724
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
You need to show where your predator

725
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
You need to add

726
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
The risks and challenges of this project

727
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
In the checkout process we had

728
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Pixar's not storing we link

729
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
Some of our policies to let people know

730
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,592
What did product need to do to get here what we might know and what we

731
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Might not know

732
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
And

733
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
We want to let people be able to then make the Judgment of their own butt

734
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
With a little bit of context from

735
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,136
A company came to the kickstarter

736
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
And you know said hey you know what the

737
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Cool product like

738
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
What headphones do something and

739
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
And we want to partner with Kickstarter to raise money

740
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
Kickstarter will do some promotion for us

741
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
Feature that the headphones in the homepage Drive traffic to it

742
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,544
And then an exchange you know we'll get Kickstarter

743
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
I think I like

744
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Like 10%

745
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Could you imagine

746
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,968
Something like that no I don't think so

747
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
Currently a game request like

748
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
In the past

749
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Listen to site

750
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,208
Is open you log on your credit password You poster project

751
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,072
I picked a lot of big companies that want to do a partnership you want to sign a contract that's

752
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,888
Nowhere like listen if you want to go do it to go log on the side

753
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
If you want like some special stuff from us or

754
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
Whatever I mean that's just not we do it

755
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
It's a relatively open door but you're not

756
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Any better than

757
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Some young Creator who's

758
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
Working on their first idea this platform built

759
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
To do what you say you want to do so

760
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
You know

761
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Go for it

762
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
How much money has

763
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Internal itching

764
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Charter projects

765
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Braced

766
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
Recently

767
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
We passed the three billion dollar

768
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Touchmark

769
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Wow

770
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,144
So huge milestone

771
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Yeah.

772
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Excited about

773
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
The money that's gone to projects. Really had very little

774
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,640
Funding sources are really constrained funding sources are funding sources that would really

775
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
Forced the Creator to contort their projects in a way that they

776
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
Might not recognize it anymore

777
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
How to make compromises

778
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
A lot of crazy people have to do

779
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
But they're really hard

780
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
That's

781
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Definitely what I'm

782
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
Most proud of

783
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,120
I've seen Kickstarter describers like that the People's National Endowment for the Arts and people it even

784
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,448
Who discovered as likely modern-day House of Medici

785
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,616
About the site that you created to you

786
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Do you identify with those descriptions

787
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Not really I mean

788
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Listening

789
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
I'm proud

790
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
But

791
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,880
You know the medicis were giving up large amounts of money and it was a

792
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Small group in a way we're trying to

793
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
Provide a clear alternative today

794
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
We know that

795
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,072
Whitman had funded some first edition

796
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
By having

797
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Subscribers that he

798
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,472
Brother names in the first edition smaller amounts in Mozart

799
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
Angela Concerto in the same way

800
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
Statue of Liberty the base was funded

801
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
They actually the

802
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,992
They would some Miniatures for a dollar or larger ones for $5 I have the statute that funded the base

803
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
So

804
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
A lot of stuff that you see on the web is

805
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Has maybe be existed

806
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
In another form nothing new Under the Sun

807
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
Pretty much it would Kickstarter

808
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
If I was telling a friend that I was working on an album and it was

809
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
Going to cost you somebody to go into a studio to make

810
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Mixdown

811
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
They're not going to hand me $5

812
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Write in a coffee shop

813
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,032
But if I put it up on Kickstarter and I'm trying to raise two grand to go to my next off my elbow

814
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
That same friend make it me $5

815
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,944
There was just this friction there was this social friction before that existed

816
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
And

817
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,296
The model has been able to eliminate that or even

818
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
Put in a way that's socially positive

819
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
So it's

820
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
The sentiment people have people want to help

821
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Each other

822
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Bring

823
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Good

824
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
Interesting ideas to life

825
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
We have

826
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Nothing to do with that

827
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
We are

828
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Enabling

829
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
What we think is a good way to do

830
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
The idea of the model of Kickstarter is just

831
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
Seems like a no-brainer not really think about

832
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,664
Companies like Uber or Airbnb or

833
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,040
You coming to connect people with other people and in some ways Kickstarter does the same thing

834
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
And

835
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,136
You guys only take 5%

836
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Which is a

837
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Pretty small amount of money

838
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
You could take

839
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
Lots more money

840
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Did you ever think about

841
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Going down that path

842
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
I mean

843
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:47,520
If you're going to try to make a lot of money you know that's almost change the fee is probably not where people would talk about they would talk about

844
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,640
Raising hundreds of millions of dollars in Venture Capital quadrupling the size of the company

845
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
And a trap of a print

846
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,480
Doing major marketing campaigns or

847
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Selling the company and

848
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
Making a ton of money

849
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
And one shot

850
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
But I think there's also like

851
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
There's got to be a way

852
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
But it doesn't have to become this kind of vehicle

853
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Only four

854
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Maximizing profit

855
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
You know

856
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
It was a quote I wish I could find

857
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Leah tribution butt

858
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
We basically that

859
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
If a corporation was a person

860
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
It would be a sociopath

861
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
And

862
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
When you create something

863
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
If you wanted to

864
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
Cher

865
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Your values

866
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
That's kind of why I ever since

867
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
The beginning we wanted to make sure to

868
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
Hold on to control

869
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
Hauser horses couldn't drive it that way

870
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
And then

871
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
Two years ago we became a public benefit Corporation

872
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Would you still up for profit

873
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Company but

874
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
It means that the

875
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Obligations of the

876
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Of the board and executive

877
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
And the company is to balance

878
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
The shareholder interest

879
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
With

880
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Greater stakeholder

881
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Including

882
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
The environment and

883
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
And you're

884
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Various communities

885
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
And that's it that makes it again something more

886
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
A representation of

887
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
People

888
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
But really underneath the Mandate is

889
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
At the end of the day make the most money for shareholders

890
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
It's a really

891
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
It's not really a

892
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
A good fit for humans and I don't think it's

893
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
It portends very well for society

894
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
If it's what we accept

895
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
As the only way to

896
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,104
You are you are no longer the CEO right

897
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
No now I'm

898
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Chair

899
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:35,552
And what was that did you just feel like a gay you know it's it's got to a place where I don't care I need to run it on a day-to-day basis setting

900
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
Yeah I mean I think that

901
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
Once we were out there

902
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
And

903
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Things were working

904
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
I started to see that

905
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Especially since we

906
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Don't want to sell

907
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Where's the Scuf

908
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Things continued to

909
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
Then it just continues

910
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
That's what we wanted we wanted to just continue

911
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
But does that mean I do this

912
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,224
Till I can't do this send our I do this for 30 years and then I write a book on leadership and like this gives

913
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,272
Speaking circuit it's like you know

914
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
So I was like

915
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,368
And I also didn't have time to work on other ideas I have

916
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
In the Arts

917
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
Not two companies and so

918
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,536
I think we were just there when I just started the window I start to see

919
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
Hey you know a gust of wind is going to blow us down

920
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
We got a great team here

921
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
And so

922
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
This might be

923
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
A good moment

924
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,592
Did you ever I get to see career North dorfmeister after all

925
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,944
I've never I Have Nots I've never seen those guys I haven't heard much

926
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,344
I'm sure they're still out there making music that I haven't I haven't even caught up on my trip

927
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,744
Start that show.

928
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
The co-founder of Kickstarter Perry back in May of 2017 he was spending most

929
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
It was time for the studio in Brooklyn working on his own projects but later that year after his fellow

930
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
Co-founder and then CEO Yancey strickler announced he was stepping down Perry actually real

931
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
Turned to Kickstarter where today he is once again running the company as CEO

932
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,952

933
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:24,352

934
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,752

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

949
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Time now for how you built that

950
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
And today we're updating story we ran

951
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
About a year ago

952
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
My name is Dustin Hoggard

953
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:19,136
We live here in Seabrook Texas it's Southeast Houston Texas up on a ranch and so he spent

954
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
And a lot of time Outdoors

955
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
Age of 10 or 11 his parents started to let him hike in the Woods by himself

956
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
Since I was a little kid I was obsessed with survival kits

957
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
When I would go to any store anywhere I would always go immediately to the survival kit section

958
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Started to design some of his own survival gear and eventually

959
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,504
He got a job with the Texas state guard in the store that you hear all the time when you

960
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,136
Do these case studies of people who are in survival or emergency accidents as if they were never expecting to get into it

961
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,768
So you need some tools on you just in case something happens will there be a natural disaster

962
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,608
Or an emergency that happens while you're out doing outdoor activity

963
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
Need to have those things on you at all times

964
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
But most people just don't have those things on them at all times I mean most people do not want to carry a bow

965
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
Bulky survival kit around on a

966
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Daily basis

967
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
They don't in the morning Keto

968
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,760
When they're going to work put on their survival kit it's awkward it's weird

969
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
And people don't like to think about that

970
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
So Dustin started to design a survival belt that you could wear everyday whether you were heading

971
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
Into the woods or you know just

972
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Going out to walk the dog

973
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,656
So when you think about a belts you think it has to be comfortable and it has will still be fashionably appealing

974
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,472
So the number one goal is to make sure that everything

975
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Fits comfortably

976
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,568
And does not weigh too much or doesn't look weird

977
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,152
Started to research how to make this belt

978
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,504
He found out that someone else was working on virtually the same thing and

979
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,576
That person lived about 15 minutes away

980
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,904
So Dustin contacted and he said hey if you know let's work together

981
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,000
It turns out that other guy was a former engineer at NASA

982
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
So they decided to partner up

983
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,168
They called a bunch of meals they found a military grade webbing for the belt

984
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
We have to figure out how to make

985
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Survival tools small enough

986
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
To fit into it

987
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,128
We had to invent every single small part of most

988
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,968
So the foil is a custom foil the duct tape as a custom duct tape

989
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,064
The water containers a custom water container all of the the parts and pieces

990
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Required us to go out and test the heck out of it Justin and his partner worked with almost 3090 facturas to

991
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,352
Custom Design every miniature Gadget that goes into the belt

992
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
The high quality

993
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
Button compass

994
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
Purification tablets and even with all of this gear on the Belt it's doesn't weigh a ton it's really

995
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
Hard to believe but if you put it on you with no you're wearing

996
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
A bunch of survival stuff

997
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
When we last heard from Dustin he and his partner

998
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
Or trying to fulfill orders from a

999
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Kickstarter

1000
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Fathead raise / 8

1001
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Quarter of a million dollars

1002
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Turned out to be

1003
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Nightmare

1004
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,048
They hit one problem after another in the manufacturing process

1005
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
SSN

1006
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,168
At the answer to thousands of angry customers who stopped they were getting scammed

1007
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,728
But finally this past May

1008
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:20,128
They managed to get all the pre-orders filled and Dustin says he feels relieved when people who had to wait

1009
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:26,528
17 months for a survival belt leave a review that says worth the wait if you want to learn more
