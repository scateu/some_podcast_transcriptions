Perfect pear

11
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,552
How are you able to come a stay optimistic or you just looking at projections and saying

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Stay optimistic what makes you think that I was optimistic I was

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
I was defiant in the face of a terrifying reality

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
Companies don't die because the companies fail they die cuz the entrepreneur gives up and that was the approach just

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,592
Keep the lights on keep growing and that's what we did

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
Is how I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idea

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
Ulysses and the stories behind the movement they built

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
How to build a multimillion-dollar men's fashion brand

00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
Bonobos

20
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Okay so before we start to show

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,320
Talk about a serious issue in men's fashion

22
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
The Khaki diaper butt

23
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
You know you see men all the time with

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
Pants that might fit perfectly in the waist but

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
Show me some little baggie in certain other areas it in this is really common because you

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Your other option

27
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Is wearing pants that are really tight in the waistband

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
If every man is wearing

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
Khaki diaper butt pants

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
What does it even matter

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Except

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,552
Andy Dunn and his co-founder Brian's family were in grad school in the mid-2000s

33
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
They had a hunch that there could be another option

34
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
A best-of-both-worlds type of

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Browser

36
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
With a curved waistband

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
Fits really well

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Eliminates that

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Diaper look

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Delete turn this idea into Aiden Cheyenne

41
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Company bonobos

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
Which in 2017

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
Sold to Walmart for a reported

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
310 million dollars

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,200
The story is a little more complicated than that because

46
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
As you were here

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,064
Andy done made a lot of mistakes along the way

48
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Thor x wenzhou bows

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Calendar

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,976
Including a very messy Fallout with a co-founder

51
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
We'll get to that little later

52
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Here's what you need to know

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Anytime grew up in the suburbs of Chicago

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
Family was squarely middle class

55
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
That was a high school teacher born and raised

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
In Chicago

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Is Mom an immigrant

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
India

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
What's an x-ray technician

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
Grew up in a bicultural house

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Even though as he tells it

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Identify that way for a long time

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
I didn't know I was different

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
It all

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Until

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
I think it was in high school

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
This kid

68
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Ed

69
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Invented a nickname for me which is Windu

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Which I guess stands for white Hindu

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
And I was totally it became a thing and you know how

72
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Teenagers are

73
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Yellow became like a good

74
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,688
Derogatory nickname and of course those can catch on like wildfire and

75
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
You know depending on

76
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
How you feel about it it can be a little bit

77
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,856
Setting Army for upsetting so I came home and I told my parents

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
Expecting empathy and instead they both started laughing

79
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
And that was the only

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Time in

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,704
In terms of awareness that I started to think like okay wait a second I'm not

82
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,544
I'm not just among mostly white people I'm I'm not

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Just

84
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
You know I'm halfway

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Half Indian which is a little bit different

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
I think I did a bad job of connecting deeply with the Indian side because of the dominant white culture that we have

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
Engagement culturally with through my mom but I didn't really own it

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Until I went to India in 1997

89
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
I went over this

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Setting freshman or sophomore in college

91
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
And that really connected me

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
And that that helped me kind of shatter the bubble that I think

93
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,359
Lightways I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago you know all the way through

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
Your college he went to Northwestern

95
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
For college and effort

96
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Studying for the MCAT

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
He decided to switch gears and going to business Consulting

98
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
And private-equity eventually

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Enrolling at Stanford Business School

100
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
It was amazing just creep people

101
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
The filter for empathy and self-awareness I think

102
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
And then there's no

103
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Great disclosure to employers

104
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,871
So they remove the competitive Dynamic of how you do in your classes

105
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,711
A minute smaller it's 350 275

106
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
People which is I guess twice the Dunbar number

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Which is the number of people that

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Existed in hunter-gatherer Villages and supposedly has the number of people where you can know every member of the tribe cheer

109
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
So you kind of her

110
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Friends with everyone or one hop away

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,887
And you put all those ingredients and you mix them together and it's a magical place

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,983
Alright so you go to Stanford in the fall of 2005

113
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
And

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
You become friends with with

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,431
Somebody was going to factor in into your life tell me tell me about meeting Brian

116
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
We became housemate.

117
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Sleep so

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,063
Once we both got into school we had a,

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
My friend kind of jazz

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
And I called up Jeff Lewis

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,511
It was an alumni of Stanford and I said Hey how do I think about getting a

122
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
A roommate for Schwab which is the building where

123
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
A lot of first-years live and he's like all you got

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
You got to live with this guy Brian's Bailey

125
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Until I invited them to come out one night

126
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
And

127
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Divers terrific

128
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
Funny and fun and

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,479
Super smart and so we became roommates

130
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
So you and Brian can roommates

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
And you're doing your own thing your take

132
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
Classes and I guess when your business school

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487
Will you personally you're constantly like

134
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Bouncing ideas off other students right because

135
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,655
ZZ ideas that they might be somebody you could build something with

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Exactly yeah I kind of thought about it as

137
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Entrepreneur-in-residence opportunity

138
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Do you like your

139
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Amongst all these brilliant people and you can

140
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Learn from them and figure out

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Hey what do they think of

142
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
A different ideas in

143
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
I had a bunch of dumb ideas and most

144
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Time people told me

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
But what were your dumb ideas

146
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
So

147
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
Taking different things I'd seen when I travel

148
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Investing in new ideas

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,143
To create those products in the US there was a South African beef jerky called biltong that didn't exist in the US

150
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
I'm a vegetarian now but I used to love this at

151
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,847
It's very different than American beef jerky a taste almost like dried filet mignon with salt pepper and coriander

152
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,455
And I couldn't believe this didn't exist in such a carnivorous country like America

153
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,575
And we got to the end of the project and the guy who is the professor overseeding in it

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
A guy named Joel Peterson you would factor in

155
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Meaningfully into bonobos

156
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
So I think this is a bad idea

157
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
To you and Brian

158
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Bailey r

159
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Roommates

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
You got a bunch of weird ideas and and he had no idea as well right

161
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
Well he had one good idea which is he was obsessed with the idea that pants don't fit

162
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
And so he did a project

163
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
Summer than what I did on biltong where he really dope deep on the idea he got cancer customer feedback

164
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
He went out to a bunch of guys in our class and ask them

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah what what are they think about their parents and everyone said the same thing we are pants don't fit so we wear jeans number one

166
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Number to we don't like shopping for him so it's not worth the time to figure out what fits

167
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
J.Crew and like you could get

168
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,103
Pants with butt but he felt that that men's pants just

169
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Didn't sit well

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,015
Yeah he felt that if the pants fit around your thighs

171
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
They tended to be too big in the waist

172
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
And if they

173
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
And so they would cinch under your belt and if it had the right fit in the waist it would be too tight through the thighs so you're either like

174
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,631
Like super uncomfortable or wearing something that was really foxy

175
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
That was his inside which was brilliant

176
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Bet that men's pants just didn't hot or not cut well exactly and what he did that most guys were

177
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
Wouldn't do as he would take pants that fit his thighs to a Taylor and have the waistband Taylor then and now is this genius

178
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Is inside the actually the way to do this is to make pants with a curved waistband

179
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Which would bring

180
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
In

181
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,047
The pant around your waist in a way where the overall shape looks looks Gray

182
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
And I hadn't really been done

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
In a meaningful way

184
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
In men's pants before

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,079
So how did Brian turn this like this project into

186
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Into the next

187
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,247
What was he mean you have this idea and embroider paper on it

188
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
And then what so yeah I'll I'll never forget that it was spring break of our second year I was

189
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
Is going to Kenya and Uganda on a service-learning trip

190
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,071
Ryan was going to head down to Brazil for a wedding one of our classmates in

191
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,191
He said what should I do should I go to Brazil for this wedding or should I

192
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
Stay here and fight and I'm heading to LA

193
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
To buy fabric and make pants

194
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
And I was like this is a no-brainer you got to go to the wedding and Brazil when are you going to have a chance to do that again with

195
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
You know a couple dozen of our classmates

196
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,879
Until I flew off to Kenya and Uganda and had an amazing trip there

197
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,463
When I came back I said how is Brazil and Brian said I didn't go

198
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
And in our house

199
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
There was like

200
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Rolls of fabric

201
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
The Brian had bought in the Garment District of LA

202
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Because he

203
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
Decided he was going to make

204
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
The pants that

205
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
But he thought men would like

206
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Exactly he thought he was going to make

207
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
Pantherfit by taking and he took a pair of pants

208
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
They had been tailored the way that she liked

209
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
Chapati maker in San Francisco

210
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
San Francisco pattern maker that made an original pattern

211
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Based on what

212
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
What the overall fit should be with the curved waistband

213
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Kid bought all this great fabric

214
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
Really cool like turquoise corduroy

215
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Really fun eye-catching stuff

216
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
And then he found I think one of the last

217
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Factories in

218
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,847
The Bay Area actually in San Francisco not far from where the Giants play baseball

219
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Which may be had five or six Cut & Sew

220
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Women working there

221
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
And they started making pants

222
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
There and said

223
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
8 *

224
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,391
Open padlock with with what money with

225
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Like with the idea of just sell it to who

226
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
He

227
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,839
Was a great pre business school moneymaker and safer so he had

228
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
Kid made some money from the company he worked at

229
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
So he he funded bonobos in those early days

230
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
And then he turned the

231
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,383
The pants that he was making into sales by selling them to our classmate

232
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
He was just like

233
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Taking a fabric that you bought in LA

234
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
And making orders with this

235
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Small Factory in the Bay Area

236
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
And he would like walk around and Hawk them

237
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Mike self into

238
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Other

239
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Students

240
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Literally

241
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,095
He had he loved Trader Joe's he had to Trader Joe's bags the red ones back at the

242
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
The time filled with pants

243
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
And he would walk around telling

244
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
People about him

245
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,543
And they would be like dropping pants behind parked cars and trees like trying them on

246
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
And people love the pants

247
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
Set the time they called him Staley pants and

248
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
I think he was charging a hundred bucks a pop

249
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
One day

250
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
We had a pants party at our house

251
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
And I think we sold $16,000 worth

252
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
And that day

253
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,231
Now is when I kind of looked at him I was just pitching in helping you know taking some pictures for the

254
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Website

255
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
We kind of looked at each other and we're like

256
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Wow this is

257
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
Becoming something

258
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
So

259
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
When did you formally get involved

260
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
So

261
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,407
I can remember sitting in class one day and on a Post-It note I was sitting next to Brian we had a different ideas for

262
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
He had ideas for what to call the parents and one of the

263
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Ideas said

264
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Bonobos bonobos I said what's a bonomo it's like many people I couldn't pronounce it and he

265
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Oh it's a it's a peaceful

266
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
Chimpanzee that makes Love Not War

267
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
I was like what do you know about that

268
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
He's like I don't know you

269
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Read about it somewhere

270
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Intel

271
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
We kind of talked about

272
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,335
Bonobo should be the name he was making all the decisions at this point

273
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Cuz it was his Hobby and

274
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
Then there was this weird thing where he had taken a job

275
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
To go into private equity

276
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,367
And I said hey you what you're doing is awesome selling pants on the internet like maybe I can make that a thing

277
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
Like this was his side hustle as a

278
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
Exactly he didn't think that this necessarily have legs

279
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Pun intended I think that

280
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
I don't know why but he

281
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
I think felt like I could do it

282
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
At that stage

283
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Into once I express interest

284
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
I became the co-founder and the CEO

285
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
And the deal was that if it really did well that

286
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
He would come back

287
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
What were people

288
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
They may say like

289
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Are you are you sure you want to do this

290
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
I had a summer

291
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
Road trip that I took my parents after graduation

292
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,071
And I sat down with them and I said I have this offer from a venture capital firm

293
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
Which was the firm up in Seattle called maveron

294
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
And I said but I don't think I'm going to take it

295
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,335
Because I'm going to sell pants on the internet

296
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Oh my God Hindi

297
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
You know

298
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
You sure and I said I was sure and they said okay

299
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,319
So in this is Ann and I guess the Summer of Love 2007

300
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
You stay

301
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
In Palo Alto

302
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Wanting to turn this into something bigger

303
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
How did you

304
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Pitch this to

305
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
Is presumably you needed my now in the making

306
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
Clothing manufacturing clothing have a lot of capital

307
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Did you have any of your own money at that point

308
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
I had nothing I had I've spent all my money

309
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Traveling in

310
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
At school I think I had about $160,000 in debt

311
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,855
Until I had one asset which was a 401k which I think if you cash in early you poop you pay a penalty so I did that

312
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,487
And I had a couple thousand dollars in the bank so we definitely need some money Brian had funded it with

313
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
50 or $60,000 of his savings and it was time back

314
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
Get some outside capital and what was your pitch I mean

315
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,519
And they were companies making men's pants and they were doing just fine there was J.Crew there's Banana Republic

316
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
And so

317
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
How are you pitching this to people who you needed to

318
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Assembly raise money from

319
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
It's an awesome question because the

320
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
You know the inside of bonobos

321
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,183
Other than the better fitting pants part was just the role that the internet was going to play in the future of retail

322
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
No retail isn't just physical

323
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,631
Products it's a bundle of physical products and customer service and those two things together create the experience

324
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
The drives customer enthusiasm

325
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
And I believe well if you could make a big brand

326
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Using a catalog

327
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
It stands to reason that you can make

328
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Even bigger Brands using the internet given the

329
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
The power of the web

330
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
And that's when we decided okay

331
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,343
We're going to build this brand online rather than through brick and mortar

332
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
And that was the pitch

333
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
What is this isn't just Ralph Lauren

334
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
This is Ralph Lauren plus apus

335
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
So who did you put it you go to Deb

336
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Ask for money

337
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,423
So my first meeting was heading like at 7 in the morning meeting

338
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
Rachel Peterson and Joel had been the guy

339
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,359
Who had presided over the biltong experiment professor at

340
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,711
At the business school yeah he was a lecturer at Stanford and then

341
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
The rest of this time you spent still doing investing

342
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
Until I kind of pitch them on the idea

343
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
And he said nothing home eating he just nodded silently

344
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
And I thought oh my God he hates this

345
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
And then we got to the very end you know 40 minutes in and he said this

346
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
This reminds me my first meeting with David neeleman from JetBlue wow which is we're going to go into a stagnant category

347
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
Not focus on customer centricity we're going to build a much more customer

348
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Centric offering

349
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,271
And disrupt the whole industry he said I'd like to invest

350
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
And I couldn't believe

351
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
I couldn't believe it how much did he give you

352
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Well at the time

353
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,023
He he said I said how much are you raising I said $300,000

354
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
He said what I said at what price I said will sell 10% of the company and you said okay that's about a 3 million dollar value a

355
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,311
He said at at 3 will take a hundred thousand but if you dropped it down to 2 will take

356
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
All around

357
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
If you drop the valuation to 2 million

358
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
He would give you $300,000

359
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
End

360
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
You were thinking that's great that's

361
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Let's do let's do it

362
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,879
No I was thinking let's stay at school 3 million

363
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Well then I went to see the other Professor from school who is amazing business person in Andy rachleff one of the

364
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
The co-founders of benchmark

365
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
And he also offered to invest

366
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
And he was willing to

367
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,799
To do it at the $3000000 price and I said okay we'll have the two of them co-invest

368
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
At 3 and then we'll figure out the rest

369
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,431
Just I just want to I just want to pause for a sec and ask you

370
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
Energy went when you met with

371
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Your first to Angel Investors

372
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671
It seems like you were able to convince them pretty quickly that

373
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
This thing

374
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
You know

375
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Battle shots

376
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
And remember a couple episodes

377
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Ago on our show

378
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Retrinal Akon

379
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Stitchfix also want to stay

380
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
Business school also created a

381
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
An online clothing retailer

382
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Oh she had a problem

383
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Initially

384
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Raising money

385
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,015
In part because you said a lot of the a lot of the investor sheet

386
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,831
Talk with which they will let me ask my wife what she say

387
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Thanks let me ask my secretary what she thinks about this

388
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
It's just surprising that

389
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
These guys

390
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Instantly were like yeah

391
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Asustor sounds good

392
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
I'll

393
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,191
Tread carefully here cuz I don't want to imply this is about

394
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
Joel and Andy

395
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
But I think

396
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
I've seen this experience my wife's an entrepreneur

397
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
My sisters and I

398
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
I think there is a lot of gender issues

399
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
I want to come stai entrepreneurship in fundraising

400
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
No worries

401
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
9% of all species are women

402
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
And a lot of the

403
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,695
The consumer spending in our world is controlled by women I think the numbers

404
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,047
Somewhere between 2/3 and 80% so we have a mismatch

405
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
We're men who don't understand

406
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Women are hot women shop

407
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,239
Are trying to decide how to make investments and only 9% of feces are women

408
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
So it's a fundamentally

409
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Misogynist

410
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Dickly wired system

411
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Thought I was fortunate

412
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
That these two amazing

413
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Investors were willing to put money in in

414
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
I think that's

415
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,183
That's one part of the story but I think the other part of the story was I had had experiences with them where they knew me when

416
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
Joel it was the biltong project

417
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
With Andy I had written him

418
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,143
I love letter basically I wrote him a four-page letter when one of our class has ended

419
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
I spent two pages saying your

420
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
One of the best teachers I've ever had and here's why

421
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
And then I spent two pages saying

422
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
I hear the things I think you could improve from having spent

423
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
A lot of time around a great teacher which is my dad

424
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
And

425
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,063
Andy later years later told me that when he cut that letter he cried

426
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
CNN he's not the kind of person where that way

427
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,743
Seemed like something that could happen but he said that it had validated a career move that he had made

428
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Talib

429
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Venture capital in to become a teacher and when he saw that he had that much impact on someone it really it really moved him so

430
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
I had a relationship

431
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
With the two professors who invested that I think was

432
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Why they invested I don't think if I had just cold

433
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Pitch them

434
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Even if I could have gotten the meeting at NASA

435
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
Surely would have been the same thing

436
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
See you raise the first

437
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Seed money

438
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
What was your next step

439
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Southern food in New York

440
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,695
Food in New York with a duffel bag full of pants and we called on a friend who

441
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,071
Graduated before us who had a job and a Michael spirito and we did a little

442
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
Trunk show at his apartment

443
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
And I think I had

444
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,239
20 pairs of pants in the duffle bag and send them out on a table and

445
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
He invited some friends through to

446
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Try on these you know

447
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Allegedly better fitting men's pants

448
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
And who I mean who was the god like

449
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Who are you targeting like

450
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,391
Who came to that truck show it wasn't the fashionistas it wasn't the people that have a really

451
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,000
Strong understanding of hey here's exactly where I go for this part of my wardrobe

452
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
It was kind of the next

453
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
Tear of guys who

454
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,448
Want to look good but didn't necessarily confess the time in it or didn't know how to do it

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,080
So is New York professional senior guys in advertising or startups or Finance

456
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,664
Two were in Michaels Network who came to this event

457
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
And I'll never forget this seven guys

458
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,368
Bought three pairs of pants six guys but two pairs of pants only one guy didn't buy anything

459
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
It was at that moment that

460
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
I decided we need to build this company in the ark

461
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
So you moved to New York

462
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
I guess in the summer or the fall of

463
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
2007

464
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,472
And did you like get an office was it

465
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
It's just you like we're

466
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
What did what did you do

467
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,872
The guy who helped me build the website for

468
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,736
What was then called bonobos pants. Com over the summer I can remember he drove me to the airport

469
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
With two

470
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
Suitcases one one was

471
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
Personal clothes in the other one was

472
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
We're bonobos pants

473
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
And I flew

474
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,560
To Chicago for a friend's wedding when I made these bright blue corduroy pants

475
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
Tube for the wedding of a friend

476
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
Inspired by Cubs baseball on I thought I'm going to sell all these

477
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,264
Like one pair because the color was so weird

478
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,872
And then food in New York and I can remember kind of coming down

479
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
2nd Avenue in

480
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,784
Heading to an apartment that a classmate of mine had rented and I just agreed to live there I've never seen it

481
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Moved into

482
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
Department put

483
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,208
A couple hundred pairs of pants up on shelves on the walls of the apartment

484
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Like in the room where I slept

485
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
And we were off the races

486
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
End

487
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Like

488
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
At that point you have this

489
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
$300,000

490
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
And

491
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
What was your next move I mean

492
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
You had to

493
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Your website

494
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,128
And pants and then and then what did you think what do you do with that boy

495
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Will 300 wasn't enough money

496
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
And so what happened was

497
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
I started to

498
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
Sell as many pants as I could in person

499
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Two guys in New York through referrals

500
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,488
So there was sort of a direct sales operation with

501
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Trunk shows

502
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
And sales in person

503
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
And then there was attempting to get some

504
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
Coverage and so what happened was our first press hit

505
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
Came from urbandaddy

506
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,408
I remember I was sitting at the Heartland Brewery and Cafe in Union Square and I got a call from

507
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Our first employee

508
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
He said Andy

509
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
We're getting too many orders should I turn off the site

510
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Endanger like how to Pedal people know about this

511
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,184
Yeah Urban daddy wrote an article

512
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Called Monkey Business

513
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Which is half right cuz bonobos are Apes not monkeys but let's set that aside basically telling a story of this brand

514
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
With great fitting men's pants

515
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
And

516
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
To this day

517
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm not sure how they found out

518
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:19,712
Literally imagine you were like going you were just calling anybody you knew and said hey can you host book a

519
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,784
Like a pants party like like like a Tupperware party

520
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
For me but with pants and and dies

521
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
Is at your apartment exactly and then the pants had these kind of signature pocket Liners in the back where you could see a difference

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
Fabric usually with a floral or geo print

523
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
And today attracted a little bit of attention

524
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Cuz they're

525
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
There was a little bit of flair and Verve to it

526
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
And

527
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,872
That also created a bit of a reality you know the name was interesting the story of these non fashion guy so

528
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
We properly launched bonobos pants. Common October of 07

529
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
And we did 10 grand that month

530
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Then in November we did 20

531
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
December we did 30

532
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Came back from

533
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,280
The holiday break in January and we didn't know sales for the first five days and I thought oh my God this was just a

534
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
A fluke

535
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,168
And then all of a sudden January February March she went 30-60-90

536
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
So

537
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
At what point

538
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
I'm after you move to New York in 2007

539
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Do things look

540
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
Pretty good enough for you could actually get in office

541
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Oh that was when we got

542
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
Kicked out of your apartment

543
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
Yeah cuz they're starting to be

544
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
I guess complaints about all the packages stacked up outside the door

545
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
In the landlord

546
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
That was me in

547
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,304
Started yelling at me and said I had to move out because I was

548
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Violating

549
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
If you can't run a business out of an apartment

550
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Until I said that I totally understand and

551
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
We found a little a little

552
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
Lofted space on 16th Street and 6th Avenue and we moved

553
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
So I have read that

554
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
Like within the first 6 months you guys

555
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
What were projecting to do like $1000000

556
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
That year

557
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Answer that I guess I was a player Brian

558
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Comes back to the company that dislike 2008

559
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Exactly yeah this was March of 08

560
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
There somewhere right in there

561
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
He was awesome

562
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,144
Because Brian was able to jump in and take on all the clothing

563
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,240
Work the sourcing that production in the design the merchandising

564
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Which freed me up

565
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
To work on the marketing

566
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
The technology making sure the fundraise was coming along

567
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
The Limited hiring that we were doing

568
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
Customer service

569
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
And we were just jamming it was an incredible time

570
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
So

571
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
I mean end of story

572
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Blake Fairy Tail ending

573
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Right I mean

574
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
That's amazing boy here's the thing

575
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Which is having 2 L

576
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Two Founders in there I think

577
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,424
If it's hard to get more complicated as we grow

578
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
And Annette

579
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
That then became the challenge of

580
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
Who makes the decision

581
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,384
More complicated between you and Brian

582
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Exactly

583
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
What was going on

584
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
So I remember this

585
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,576
Debate about what to do after pants I think we've spent

586
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:11,488
At some point maybe a year-and-a-half just focus on pants we started thinking about the next product category

587
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
And Brian was excited about swimsuits

588
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
And

589
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
I was excited about shirts

590
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
And there was really good rationale behind both

591
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Until Weaver

592
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
We are in conflict over business decisions like that and then on a

593
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,920
Personal level what I realize is once you get into a Business Partnership

594
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
With a friend

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
The Friendship gets totally sublimated

596
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
The Business Partnership

597
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,344
So a lot of the stuff that you used to talk about or do

598
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
You don't have time to do cuz you got to work on this little growing baby

599
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Company

600
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
And so it went from what was really fun

601
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
And kind of the

602
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Laissez-faire world of friendship where you talk

603
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
About the things you want to talk about it and do whatever is fun

604
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,080
And support each other when things are difficult and it actually flipped that it takes away all the fun

605
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
The support that you need your no longer going to get

606
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
From that person

607
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,016
Except for very fortunate friends and business partners where can

608
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
And all the magic

609
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Can come together

610
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
And then press it just became talking about big decisions at the company in

611
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Frequently not seeing

612
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
Not seeing eye-to-eye and so it really it Unwound how you resolved that conflict cuz we were 50/50 Park

613
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Partners

614
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
You know I have the title of CEO but Brian

615
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
Had a ton of business acumen

616
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
And so it really was a partnership of equals and it becomes difficult to figure out who makes the call

617
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
And

618
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,576
And how are you personally, though it was it was it like waiting on you or did you fly

619
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
Like sleepless nights I got depressed

620
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:49,792
So it turns out I have a propensity clinically for depression and so I got to the place

621
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:56,192
Swear I kind of had to fake it at work that I was doing okay but drag myself out of bed and come to the office

622
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
And kind of put on a show yeah it was super tough to navigate that cuz you're you're definitely on

623
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,480
Display in a small company so what was the office

624
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,064
Environment like like where their days were you and Brian were just

625
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Not speaking or was it just like clipped conversation or what

626
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,536
I thought we were doing a pretty good job of talking in private and then

627
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Presenting a unified front right out of the way you talk about you know parents and kids and then

628
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Then I got a call from one of our investors and he said I heard that you and Brian are fighting Ally from your

629
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
Wow how did that happen

630
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
He said that's really bad

631
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,624
And I said you know what do I do and he said

632
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,000
You got to come and get to the bottom of what's causing that and it'll get to a place where

633
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
Where you can work together and

634
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,656
Now is the beginning of a process of figuring out your how do you resolve it

635
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
I cannot imagine

636
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
That because you have this

637
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Business that

638
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Rolling in the

639
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,944
It's exciting and you can start to see where this might be headed

640
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
But

641
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,784
The whole thing could I also unravel like

642
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
There was a

643
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
You must have thought in your mind

644
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Maybe this

645
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Crash and Burn

646
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
He was a little

647
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Different than that

648
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:29,376
In that I thought you know bonobos is going to make it and it's got to make it it was more

649
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Should I leave

650
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Worship Brian Lee

651
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
Because I thought the company was going to do

652
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Fine it was just

653
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
If we needed at Clear CEO

654
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,200
But you had come to this conclusion in your mind or maybe Brian had to that

655
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
You were not going to be able to

656
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
To do this together

657
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,648
Yeah I didn't have the ability to do it just based on the

658
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Depression in

659
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
Someone said Hey Siri I see a therapist

660
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,560
11 Lisa and I I had some

661
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
Shame or embarrassment around that

662
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
At that time and I finally said I got to go do it so you did

663
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
I did

664
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,568
And you probably were so busy like you had to pry car about that time as well

665
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
Yeah I used to take a taxi

666
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Uptown

667
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
Random part of the Upper West Side

668
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:22,112
And do work calls on the way there and then went saw this therapist and we were a few sessions in and she said handy

669
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Are you in touch with anger

670
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
And I said anger

671
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
What's anger

672
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
And

673
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
And that was the beginning of this realization like hey if you're if you actually are

674
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Or you have an emotion

675
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
You've got to express it

676
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
Because if it's sublimated she goes you know sublimated anger

677
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Can become depressed

678
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,736
And so that was when I realized actually gosh I'm angry about a lot of these Dynamics

679
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
And

680
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
And we've got to figure something out

681
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
2 going through this antenna

682
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
Trying to work through

683
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Your depression and also

684
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,512
Related to that depression obviously was was

685
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
What was clearly a

686
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
The beginning of a breakup

687
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
With

688
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Your co-founder

689
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Friend

690
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
What happened how did you

691
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Solve this

692
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
So

693
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
It was a very

694
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Bad way to do it

695
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Probably speaking to the challenges I had with difficult conversations in Candor in person but I wrote Brian a longing

696
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,440
Right basically said luck I think one of us should become the chairman the other be the CEO

697
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
And I'll take either side of the trade

698
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
And the CEO can run the day today and run the company and the chairman can focus on external work

699
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
That was how the conversation started was through that

700
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Open it up

701
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
And then one day

702
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,896
We are in the office I'm supposed to work on Saturdays and just get stuff done at the office and

703
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
One day I just asked him I said hey

704
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Would you be willing to step aside

705
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
You don't give in

706
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Giving everything is going on in

707
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
He got a little teary and he looked at me and he said

708
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Yeah

709
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:08,864
It which was so weird cuz I had envisioned that conversation so many times and was so terrified to have it

710
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
And he was just

711
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
Unbelievably

712
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Dignified

713
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
About the whole thing

714
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,824
And that was when I learned you learn a lot about a person

715
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
By the way they leave something that they love

716
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Yeah I mean it

717
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
It speaks to

718
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
His

719
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
Ampersand

720
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Kiki is that he

721
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
Had the foresight to know that

722
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
One of you

723
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Had to go

724
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
And

725
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
He was willing to be the one

726
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
It was

727
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,048
An unbelievable GIF time and he gifted

728
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
The company

729
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
Did he had originally

730
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Conceived of

731
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Tumi

732
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,264
To this day

733
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
The Loyalty that I feel to him for having done that

734
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
An end then the fact that afterwards it

735
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
It's difficult

736
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Write that friendship is

737
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,832
Has been eviscerated by that business issues

738
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
And

739
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
It took many years

740
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Before we could

741
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Sit down in

742
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Have dinner and

743
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,096
Go to Cubs games together and see you've reconciled to bed by this point you reckon

744
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Yeah I think so

745
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
If you could do it all over again

746
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
With Brian

747
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Did you think

748
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
You guys

749
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Could have worked

750
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Through those things

751
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
I don't think

752
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Unless I

753
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Could have been more enlightened

754
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
At the time about how to

755
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
How to do it

756
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
I think we were both

757
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Zoe

758
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,000
Young and in some ways insecure and trying to prove ourselves in

759
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
You know in some regards I think

760
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,424
Arrogant I I think that it was going to be hard at that stage of both of our Lives to figure it out

761
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
But I would I wouldn't do it any other way

762
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
You know the way that it we did it was how it had to be done

763
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,992
You know Brian went out and built another company called Trunk Club and did an amazing job with that

764
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
And he's got to

765
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
Amazing Stories

766
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
And so I'm so grateful to him that he enabled bonobos Thrive and gave me the opportunity to continue to build it

767
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
To Sabrina leaves

768
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
This is 2009 and your

769
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,704
Your laugh I guess is that is a CEO is a top decision maker

770
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
2008 was the

771
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Was the co-founder

772
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Separation

773
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Thought that would

774
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
And all this

775
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
Depression I thought that would be the worst year of my life

776
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
2009 was far worse

777
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
Because I couldn't I could no longer blame anything on Brian

778
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Had to blame it on myself

779
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
When we come back in just a moment so Andy capp's bonobos alive despite

780
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
Mistake after mistake after mistake

781
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,592

Hey welcome back to how I built this

795
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Best from NPR

796
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
So it

797
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
It's the beginning of 2009

798
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Andy just went through the

799
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
Hardest year of his life

800
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,144
Co-founder Brian spaly left the company

801
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
An enemy is now a loan

802
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Top

803
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
It's not

804
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Too dramatic to say that

805
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Company

806
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
Was in a bit of a

807
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Prices

808
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:09,248
It was a scary year I thought I was good hiring in a bunch of people I'd hired didn't workout

809
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,624
I thought that I was good at fundraising and we were running out of money like how close were you to

810
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Insolvency

811
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
I flew to

812
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
Silicon Valley one day from New York

813
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Because

814
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Are then had to finance told me that we weren't going to make payroll we had enough cash in the bank I thought

815
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,544
Make payroll but then we had a guest promises supplier through a letter of credit

816
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
And we were about

817
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
8 days away from that make

818
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,224
Payroll which is not an inspiring moment for your employees

819
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
And I went to

820
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
Hertz Rent-A-Car in San Francisco

821
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,160
To rent a car and I swiped the card and it was due

822
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Decline

823
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Yeah

824
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,072
Swipe my personal credit card which which was

825
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:59,936
Somehow still solvent spite of all the debt that I had and I

826
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
Drove to a Starbucks and sat down with

827
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
With

828
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,336
Someone who knew about the company in

829
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,432
Explain to him our growth and said we definitely need some more money I didn't I didn't

830
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,576
Say where we needed the next week and he offered to invest $300,000 in the business

831
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,696
And then I had another 90 conversations like that over the course of an ex

832
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
Couple months and piece together another round and you know we ended up raising

833
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,680
Our first eight million from you know over

834
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Over a hundred and twenty investors

835
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
So we just pieces

836
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Together

837
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Cuz you had a meal

838
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
The trajectory looked good on you were still

839
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,480
Presumably growing every month but I have to imagine that

840
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Sales were not able to fund the business

841
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
It was not properly

842
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
Yeah we we did 2 million in that first year and

843
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
Kind of full operations in a way

844
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
And then for

845
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
In 09

846
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
And then

847
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
We were heading towards

848
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
7 or so

849
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
I think we made one of the Cardinal errors that an entrepreneur makes which is the second Angel round that we raise we re

850
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Race at too high of a price

851
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
And actually Joe was

852
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Pretty upset about this

853
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
I actually think I wrote the email to

854
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Control that

855
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,576
Was a condescending email on summerguard around supporting the company in

856
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
It was the dumbest email I've ever written

857
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
And Joel then said he wanted to sell his shares

858
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
Created a whole issue for ourselves

859
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
And then ultimately

860
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,888
Ultimately figure out a way to get the round done in

861
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
And Joel didn't invest

862
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
So you bet mean

863
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Your Patron

864
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
Like the guy who

865
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Was your first

866
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Investor

867
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
He's out he's out of that next round

868
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
He was out

869
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
Wow that's a big deal cuz he was like a mentor to you

870
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
It was a terrible

871
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
It was

872
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,696
Was really really bad and so I flew out to apologize to him and I said I really screwed this up

873
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
I said what what you consider

874
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
Now that we have this discussion with you

875
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
You consider ever invest me again and he said look not right now but maybe

876
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Let's talk later

877
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Infer

878
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
The next round that I raised

879
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
I went out and saw me I said look up

880
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
I've learned so much from you I learned a ton from you and terms

881
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,640
How badly I handled that

882
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Situation

883
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,528
You actually tell me the truth and hold me to account would you consider coming on to our board

884
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,112
Not only investing but coming under the board and he said yes

885
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Well

886
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Aside from raising money

887
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
We're still

888
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
Running a company

889
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
It was both a

890
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
Men's fashion company any technology

891
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
E-commerce

892
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
This is not

893
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
Brick-and-mortar stuff

894
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
So how is the technology side

895
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Bonobos

896
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
How is that working

897
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
It was a huge challenge

898
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Cuz at the time the New York

899
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
Tech ecosystem was pretty small or lease it felt small to me

900
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
And

901
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,856
At the same time it was really hard to attract talented

902
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
You know software engineer

903
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
They were all in in the Bay Area

904
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
They were in the Bay Area or you know they wanted to work at a company where the core Enterprises technology versus a pan

905
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Yeah

906
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
It was really a a rift

907
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,496
Between the folks who worked on

908
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
Technology in the folks who worked

909
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,360
On the rest of the business it wasn't

910
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
There was a

911
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
Battle over the soul of the company

912
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,528
You know was it a technology company or was it a

913
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Menswear company

914
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
But it was both

915
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
Which is the challenge I mean

916
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
If I had been a better leader maybe I could have figured out how to do that you don't we open an office

917
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,424
In Palo Alto and it turned out to be a catastrophic error

918
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
Because all of a sudden now you got your New York office and then the technology people were in

919
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,223
Exactly and if you think tribalism and human nature is still alive within one off

920
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
When you have people in different places with different ideas about what the saw the company is and you

921
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:09,023
Increase the expense and by the way you're now competing to hire software Engineers with

922
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:15,423
Facebook and Netflix and the pay is higher you know all those ingredients came together and it was clear

923
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,823
Clear after about a year that we had hired the people but it wasn't working

924
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
It deepens the divide between let's just call it tek in retail and

925
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:33,599
It's hard enough to be a good CEO when you've got five days a week in the same office

926
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,415
All of a sudden you're two days a week in each office

927
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
You were flying back and forth

928
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Between New York and Palo Alto

929
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Yeah

930
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,327
And you then you're letting people down on both sides

931
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,959
In so I'm I'm trying to imagine you as a CEO

932
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,031
Going back and forth and trying to kind of

933
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
I guess keep everybody

934
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Be happy

935
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
But the tech

936
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,711
The tech folks write the engineers like they have knowledge that

937
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
You just didn't have your not a

938
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Attack guide

939
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
It's not your

940
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Like skill set

941
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
2

942
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,671
Did you feel like you couldn't just

943
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,695
Tell them what to do

944
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
I don't think you can tell anyone in this life what to do

945
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
I mean I think you can try

946
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
But human beings are a gallon species we don't

947
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
Authority

948
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,007
Until what you want to do is inspire people yeah

949
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,823
And you want to set a common Vision in contacts

950
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Shared values and then

951
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
There are times where you have to step in intervene

952
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
And make important difficult calls

953
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
But

954
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,831
What it was was it was clear to me

955
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
Oh my God

956
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,439
Did the organizational Harmony at the company was being destroyed

957
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Baidu

958
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Cross Coastal

959
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Conflict

960
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
And so

961
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
In some regard it became pretty straight

962
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Forwarding

963
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,727
I brought to the board and they couldn't believe that we were going to pull the plug your in you went to the board and you said

964
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,287
I want to pull the plug on this West Coast office

965
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
I said this isn't working

966
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
And they said what

967
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
How do you know in a year

968
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Yeah when we give it two or three

969
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,807
And I said look this is becoming more costly this is becoming Harder by the day

970
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
The culture is deteriorating

971
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
This is just wrong

972
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,951
In spending more time is going to only make it

973
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
More expensive

974
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,559
More doubling down on a sunk cost

975
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Let's

976
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,655
Lots of Jessica lesbian Electronics here and let's adjust course

977
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,215
How could you do that I mean

978
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,567
Your core bit of your business depended on these Engineers like

979
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
You are work

980
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Are a technology company to I mean

981
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,015
How do you just say let's pull the plug on it and we'll figure it out me that's

982
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
It seems like

983
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
A lot of stuff in this afternoon at world

984
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
Pull the plug on the whole division

985
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
I was really scared

986
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
But what I've learned

987
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
In 11 years of doing this is

988
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,495
Sometimes when you're the most afraid

989
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Is when you're making

990
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
One of the

991
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Most important decisions

992
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,639
Right like if it's not scary

993
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
It's not hard

994
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
And I think ultimately what we

995
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
We need to Value more in this life for everyone not just Hunters is courage

996
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
The courage to look at yourself honestly

997
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
Look at the decisions you're making honestly

998
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
And save yourself you know what

999
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
That was my fault

1000
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
I got that wrong I'm not going to blame anyone else

1001
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,935
I'm going to take responsibility for it and I'm going to fix it

1002
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
It's 2013

1003
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,871
Clos DES office on West Coast you have

1004
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
Almost no

1005
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Engineering staff left

1006
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
You got no

1007
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,831
Chief technology officer I'm assuming at this point either right

1008
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
No so what did you do

1009
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
We we got

1010
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,231
You have two engineers in the state of scientist to relocate

1011
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Literally I remember sitting in a

1012
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
At a coffee shop in Palo Alto

1013
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Just back

1014
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
I mean literally begging

1015
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,495
Being like will you please come to New York at least for 1 to 2 years

1016
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,359
And so it really didn't work out and I'm not I don't even want to think about running that play in retrospect

1017
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
You know without those two came

1018
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
So once you kind of

1019
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
Recover from that account

1020
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Pek

1021
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
In a mini

1022
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
Disaster or more than a disaster

1023
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,415
And things started to stabilize first

1024
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
What is the company

1025
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,791
Profitable was it making money in 2013/2014

1026
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
Not yet

1027
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,399
But we were we were massively turning the corner towards break even

1028
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
I would be free

1029
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Freaking out like I mean

1030
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:38,591
How do you how are you able to come to stay optimistic and were you just looking at projections and saying

1031
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Stay optimistic what makes you think

1032
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
Did I was optimistic I was

1033
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
I was

1034
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
Defiant in the face of

1035
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
A terrifying reality

1036
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
And ultimately you just

1037
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Got to Believe

1038
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
It's almost religious it is religious

1039
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
It's faith

1040
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,863
And there's a really good saying I don't want to say this is true cuz I've been lucky

1041
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
But that

1042
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Companies don't die

1043
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,495
Because the companies fail they die cuz the entrepreneur gives up

1044
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
And that was the approach just keep the lights on

1045
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Keep growing

1046
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Keep learning

1047
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
And that's what we did so what was the thing that

1048
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,783
That enabled you to turn the corner just more customers more awareness

1049
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
More what

1050
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,183
I think was actually more Focus so what what really changed the company

1051
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
Was the move from single channel to molt

1052
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Meaning

1053
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Meaning

1054
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:36,703
The build-out of the relationship with Nordstrom in the reinvention of the retail store with the guy shot model

1055
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,263
Can this was an incredible paradox

1056
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,311
Cuz everyone was betting on e-commerce

1057
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Venture capital is flowing into econ

1058
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
Countless companies were rising and falling

1059
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,783
And the irony of our business was after years of being told

1060
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
It wholesalers going away

1061
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
And IT department stores were dying

1062
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,463
Are most profitable business became Nordstrom

1063
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,047
And our second most profitable where are retail stores

1064
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,887
And those two businesses profits were funding losses from e-commerce

1065
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
The wonderful paradox

1066
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
To the way that we can see for the company

1067
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Yes I guess I guess we could we should

1068
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:17,919
Explain this for people who have not been the shop cuz I've been doing guide shop in general you don't go in and then walk out with a pair of trousers

1069
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
Right you go in and get

1070
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Did it

1071
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,527
And then the trousers are sent to

1072
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
Exactly it's

1073
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
It's a bit to ship concept

1074
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
So when you think about our

1075
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
This was another really fun board mean

1076
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Was

1077
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
This debate around is this an e-commerce company or is this a menswear

1078
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Experience company

1079
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:42,495
And I need the case and this is the people that funded the company with a view of e-commerce

1080
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
Being at the core that our company was actually not an e-commerce company it was about serving this customer

1081
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:54,527
If we could invent way to deliver the same level of fit and service in person

1082
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
Then that would actually be consistent in a deepening of who we are getting us closer to go to Who We Are

1083
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,559
2R torsoless a business versus getting away from it

1084
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,935
What's the question was why you do that with physical inventory if the whole model of bonobos

1085
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Is offering a lot more sizing

1086
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
And a lot more fits in a lot more colors

1087
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,103
If you look at are chinos business

1088
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
We got 36 waist and inseam combinations

1089
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,247
Four different it silhouettes

1090
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
And we might be running 15 to 20 colors

1091
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Ticketmaster

1092
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
4 to 5000.

1093
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,975
How do you possibly stock that so that the incredible Insight was

1094
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
You don't

1095
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
You don't stock it you create a clothing store that has no clothing

1096
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
And that was the inside

1097
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,959
Which is the customer doesn't need it right away in that flew in the face of

1098
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,007
Everything everyone in retail told me

1099
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
From the traditional industry

1100
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Instant gratification

1101
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
It turns out for a busy customer that's just not true

1102
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
If they get great service which is what you can put out

1103
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
If you ripped it inventory out

1104
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
You put the service in

1105
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,439
It actually is a much more magical combination in terms of dollars per square foot productivity

1106
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
And customer

1107
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,535
Delight you know as measured by net promoter score

1108
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Yeah

1109
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
As you can as you start

1110
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
To turn a corner

1111
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
I guess you also

1112
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
All star tattoo

1113
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,495
Attract more and more investors

1114
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
And more and more capital

1115
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
Fuel the growth

1116
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,383
What does it mean for for your own state

1117
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
Did you quit will you just getting more more diluted and

1118
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Did you care was that important to you

1119
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,599
Oh wow this is a fun question what it would it leads to

1120
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,231
You know I think a lot of times as a Founder you're thinking I'm going to go do this for 2 years and see if it works and then I'm going to do it

1121
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
Four five

1122
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,559
Which country lies is it takes a decade to build a real

1123
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
And so what happens is

1124
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
After four years here you fully vested

1125
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
And then you got a debate which is

1126
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
Stay where you are

1127
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
Take on more Capital get diluted

1128
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
What's happened to all the other shareholders

1129
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
Or ask for more equity

1130
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,711
One day I woke up and said you know what

1131
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,295
I'm going to ask for more I want to get my steak back

1132
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,879
How to more meaningful Evelyn and I had this really unusual

1133
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
A zero-sum Game standoff

1134
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
To the board and said I want more equity

1135
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,815
Seems like a fair request and what do they say

1136
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
They said no

1137
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
Pittsburgh

1138
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
And you know

1139
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Said hey like you need to work

1140
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
You need to work for the sheriff so you've got

1141
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,847
And then you know ultimately

1142
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
I just

1143
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,223
Warm down and I got some alternative perspectives

1144
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
From people in the venture capital.

1145
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,623
Company space and said hey this is this feels right to me

1146
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,999
Was there a mean in a weave interview lots of entrepreneurs to move take on capitalism

1147
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
Don't to bootstrap in then

1148
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,607
No sell it for hundreds of millions of dollars

1149
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,447
What as you saw the value of the company go up

1150
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
But you're

1151
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Part of it

1152
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
You know

1153
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
Going down

1154
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Did you

1155
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,711
Did you care or did you say you know there's a certain point I mean

1156
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,991
A certain number

1157
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Is just a number and

1158
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
That's great

1159
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
You know

1160
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
If this works

1161
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
A little bit of money

1162
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,231
Oh my God I thought

1163
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
I'll be so lucky

1164
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
Tav

1165
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Have any of this

1166
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
And I think it's warped to live in a world where

1167
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
Let's say

1168
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
You're going to make

1169
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
$29

1170
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,567
Difference between 20 million dollars in $109

1171
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
It's not clear

1172
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Yeah

1173
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Right

1174
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Enough for me

1175
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,991
The only things that excess Capital are good for

1176
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
Is getting money

1177
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
The family

1178
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
And loved ones

1179
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:45,439
Who were part of Ginyu to where you were my case you know an immigrant mom

1180
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,743
In high school history teacher dad

1181
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
That's number one number two is

1182
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,959
Investing in other entrepreneurs and companies number three is making political contributions if you want to influence the future in our forest being phone

1183
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Don't drop it

1184
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Now I'd love throwing some nice seats

1185
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
The Cubs game 2

1186
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,663
But the idea that you're trying to optimize for making

1187
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
And more than yeah yeah it's just

1188
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:13,343
I don't get it I think you get Warped cuz you start to heal about hear about what other Founders are making in

1189
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
You hear about

1190
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
You start today

1191
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,999
Is the human problem I restart a circle with people wear

1192
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
You sure to live in these bubbles

1193
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
Where people have so much money

1194
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
Yeah and then I would just cut back to hey when I graduated business school I have $3,000 in the bank and $160,000

1195
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Mars attack

1196
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,591
And I started the company with that balance sheet that was scary

1197
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
End

1198
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
So

1199
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,759
I tried to stay true to that and think instead about how do I make sure everyone else thinks

1200
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,855
How do I make sure that our shareholders from every round

1201
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
You know that we're dropping to the right on the post-money valuation and ultimately going to make people money how do I make sure the management

1202
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Tina's enough stock

1203
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
Employees have stock

1204
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
And I'm going to be fine

1205
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Yeah

1206
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:04,287
Speaking out of two sides my mouth is on the one hand that's what my philosophy is on the other hand I did say look look I want to be inside

1207
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,103
I do feel like at the end of the day

1208
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,711
You know owning two or 3% of the company is probably not commensurate with the work put in

1209
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
And bolts word of is my fault that we had to raise so much capital

1210
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
It also is

1211
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
The price of innovation

1212
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,207
If you're the first mover in the degenerative brand space and you're going to invent that model

1213
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,303
I can't go back in time and undo this company on 20 to 30 million

1214
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
If it's what I think it is

1215
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,863
Would take knowing what I now know

1216
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:34,495
Wow did we get to have fun learning everything we did and why was it gratifying to be

1217
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,591
To be the Pioneer in the category in a freezing lot of capital is the price of that

1218
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Northern that's what the price of it was

1219
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
So you guys

1220
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
You know you finally turned a corner

1221
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
And you're growing

1222
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,855
And this brand is out in the world

1223
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
And then what

1224
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,695
Seem to hit the rest of the

1225
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Piano

1226
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,279
What team is the rest of us fall into

1227
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,559
It's like a lightning was

1228
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,631
In 2017 you sold to Walmart

1229
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,679
How did that happen today

1230
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:09,311
Did they approach you guys do they say Hey you know we want to buy you did you go to them where you did you

1231
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Get to a point where you side okay

1232
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
We got to find a buyer because I'm going to pay these investors

1233
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
I was at a wedding

1234
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
And I was talking to you

1235
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Friend

1236
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
And

1237
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,623
He knew one of our Angel Investors

1238
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:27,487
And that angel investor said you know bonobos is great but I wonder if I'll ever

1239
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,047
Paid

1240
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
And I think at that point he'd invested

1241
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
Eight or nine years ago in the very first round

1242
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
And that wasn't the only reason but once you got Venture investors who been in

1243
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,615
For 7 years and Angel Investors who've been in for 10

1244
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
It just would be wrong

1245
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
Chin. Make other people money

1246
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
So

1247
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,855
I felt like we were at that stage where the company that get ready for the next stage we had

1248
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,671
Discovered our soul as a consumer retail company

1249
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,047
And we needed to learn from people that we're good at taking some retail companies public

1250
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
That's the point ride and then

1251
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
At the eleventh hour

1252
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,215
I got a phone call to do a reference

1253
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,799
And I get the reference and then the individual who's calling me

1254
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
Said how are things going

1255
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,383
This is someone that I have a colleague from

1256
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,967
From way back and I said look we're in the middle of this process and

1257
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
Hey why don't you come talk to us

1258
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
He worked at jet.com

1259
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
And I was like a new

1260
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
Genderbent acquired by Walmart

1261
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,695
Denmark lorry for years

1262
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,327
And every time I saw him we are game-changing for me a game-changing conversation

1263
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,935
Founder of jet prank to probably the best third-party e-commerce entrepreneur

1264
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
On East Coast

1265
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,543
I said you know what I know Mark II can't understand how

1266
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
How would Walmart

1267
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
And bonobos be a fit

1268
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
Doesn't make sense

1269
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:54,527
I just talked to him and I thought you know what every time I've talked to Mark I found him to be a bit of a Jedi

1270
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,927
And we sat down and it was amazing I didn't think Mark cared about Brands and then we had this incredible mind meld

1271
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,255
Did the future of e-commerce was going to look a little bit like

1272
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
History of Netflix

1273
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Set a

1274
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
I formed it with streaming other people's content

1275
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,031
Distributing other people's content would vertically integrate and start to develop their own

1276
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
Proprietary

1277
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,407
Right and Mark and I might melt it that was going to happen Commerce and that

1278
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,199
Bonobos was going to be

1279
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
The brand

1280
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
EE.

1281
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
And that we would go and

1282
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
Lo and behold that long

1283
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,159
Set long dreamed of multi-brand vision

1284
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,767
Was going to come to fruition in the least expected way I could have ever imagined

1285
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,351
Which is with the power of Walmart and Walmart's balance sheet behind it

1286
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
How long does it take

1287
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Before

1288
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
You close a deal

1289
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Yeah

1290
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,215
It took months

1291
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,263
And it was made Tricky by the fact

1292
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,287
That the deal leaked

1293
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
In the middle of the process

1294
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
And because Walmart

1295
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
The public company

1296
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
World's largest and revenues I couldn't sing

1297
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Do you have to walk

1298
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,039
Go to the office and show up like nothing was going on

1299
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,855
Well that's out that wasn't the approach Alton

1300
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
Because people you know the quote on quote

1301
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
Water cooler talk was

1302
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
Channing and then there were messages on slack saying

1303
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
This is

1304
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
This is a

1305
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
Catastrophe for the brand

1306
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
With no

1307
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
Walmart acquiring bonobos

1308
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
I got it

1309
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Like I wouldn't

1310
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Didn't have the

1311
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:23,359
Understanding of the strategy in the way that Walmart and jet.com

1312
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
Transforming

1313
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
E-commerce for the company

1314
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,991
It wouldn't make sense and so I had to call a very strange meeting

1315
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
This is before you close a deal this

1316
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
Tweaking out in

1317
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Italy

1318
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
I was out of the office

1319
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,695
I was actually working on the deal elsewhere

1320
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
I rushed back to the office and

1321
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
I got everyone together

1322
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
And I said we're going to have a very unusual meeting

1323
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Here's what I can tell you

1324
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,215
I love this company at least as much as you do

1325
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
You know me

1326
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,591
I would never guide us to doing anything that wasn't

1327
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:59,199
In our self-interest is Brandon is a company and its shareholders and employees of the bran

1328
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,527
What has been published is not

1329
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,063
A fact

1330
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
It's not

1331
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
An announcement

1332
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
It's speculation

1333
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
We have not

1334
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Decided our path

1335
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
In our process

1336
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
And when we have news

1337
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Versus rumors

1338
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Of course you'll be the first to know

1339
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
When we have news

1340
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
And in the meanwhile please

1341
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
Get back to work

1342
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,335
It was the weirdest man ever at everyone just got up

1343
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,711
I went back to work and I'm sure the conversation continue

1344
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,807
But it just the energy change by directly addressing it

1345
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
It felt like

1346
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Wow that

1347
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,415
That turns out that just killing people

1348
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,463
Like it is the truth

1349
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,535
In the trees was we had decided at that moment

1350
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:50,655
And then it I think it was another couple months before we actually could announce

1351
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,823
There's a big difference in going to Walmart and buying a pair of jeans and going and buying

1352
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
The premium brand right like

1353
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063
There were people who said wait a minute now I own Walmart closet full of Walmart close

1354
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,671
You know why I can't blame people for reacting that way

1355
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,743
No not at all so we anticipated

1356
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:20,863
Meaningful blowback and if you go back and look at what I wrote at the time

1357
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,167
I was pretty direct the day of

1358
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,495
The day of the announcement around the future of an oboes

1359
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,055
And I said look I think a lot of people are going to be

1360
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
By this

1361
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
In

1362
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,711
It was fasting for 72 hours there's a really big

1363
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,295
Reaction in an availability bias of the most vocal people

1364
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
And then

1365
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,903
In a business return to normal the vast majority of people

1366
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
Don't think about the stuff that much everyday

1367
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
And for me

1368
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,303
But I couldn't say to them is

1369
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
Hey been almost gets to continue to exist

1370
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Write like

1371
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,751
Because we get home you know how hard that is actually like

1372
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,799
Security outcome

1373
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
Walmart

1374
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Reportedly

1375
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,175
Paide 310 million dollars

1376
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,247
Griffin elbows which is

1377
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,551
Impressive mean it's a lot of money

1378
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,879
How did you respond to that number does it

1379
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
Didn't mean anything to you where you

1380
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
Proud that you got to that point

1381
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Or

1382
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Was it just a

1383
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
Signature at the bottom of a sheep

1384
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,399
I'm so proud it's so hard to do that

1385
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,215
So hard to build a company that

1386
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,007
Ends up being worth something

1387
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
Really meaningful

1388
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
It was just a staggering number

1389
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
And I was so grateful that we got that done and got a chance to let you know there very few things in this life you can look at and say we did that

1390
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,831
In selling a company is one of those moments

1391
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
I'm so I'm so proud

1392
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,927
We got the chalk that one up in the baguette

1393
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
We get to keep going

1394
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
And I really safe home

1395
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,791
You know people ask why are we doing this

1396
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,887
And part of it is hey I'm excited about the strategy but part of it is

1397
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
We get to exist now

1398
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
If we do our jobs well

1399
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
For a long time

1400
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,055
Maybe maybe 50 years or more

1401
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,615
Maybe a hundred years bonobos will be around

1402
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
And not

1403
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
That's rare

1404
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
And I always ask

1405
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
What's the question

1406
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Most offensive

1407
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
Question

1408
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,855
AB to the people interview with just how much of

1409
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
What

1410
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,463
Happened to you and and the creation of bonobos in it

1411
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
Success was because of

1412
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
You and your talent and

1413
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,655
What was the decision you made and how much of it was because of

1414
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Black

1415
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,983
Luck is a concept that

1416
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
I thought of in a straightforward way

1417
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
For a while

1418
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,919
And then when I converted to Judaism last February I became acquainted with this concept of

1419
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Kismet

1420
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Which is

1421
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,295
I am pronouncing right probably but it's kind of the intersection of luck and serendipity

1422
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
And maybe even

1423
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,391
Some measure of Destiny I don't want to go that far

1424
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,975
Cuz I still don't know why really bad things happen to good people

1425
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
So

1426
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
I think you got to be open in life

1427
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,655
To the way that the universe is trying to help you

1428
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,751
The people who love you quotes you just listen to them

1429
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
And cultivate relationships with

1430
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
People who are direct will tell you what you

1431
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Need to hear

1432
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
If it's not what you want to hear

1433
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,247
The same thing that accompany the people on the way

1434
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,039
Your board your investors your employees

1435
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
Kuno as a collective

1436
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
What to do

1437
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
More so than you but in combination

1438
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,463
You can unlock

1439
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,071
So I think if you bring self-awareness and you bring empathy and you bring

1440
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,143
Positivity and you bring intellectual honesty and courage

1441
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Ultimately try to make

1442
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,007
I think you can influence a lot

1443
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
But I would have tribute

1444
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
I would attribute

1445
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,175
This outcome in this company

1446
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,479
At the end of the day to three things

1447
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
To the quality of the

1448
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
People

1449
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
Around me on all fronts

1450
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:57,695
To the hard work of those people who really believed in this and made this happen

1451
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,719
The team

1452
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
And then a healthy healthy dose of

1453
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,351
Self-awareness in the pursuit of

1454
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Qismat

1455
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
So you're not a believer

1456
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
I am

1457
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,799
I am I think that the two

1458
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
That you're

1459
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
The two

1460
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
Really big things that influence your life

1461
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
The family that you're born into

1462
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
And

1463
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,855
I don't know what to call it that your DNA the genetic stock who you know who

1464
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
How you show up as

1465
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,927
Is a creature as a human being

1466
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
You have no control over those two things

1467
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,559
Until I feel like in life I was dealt if we call it luck

1468
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,911
You know I don't want to say pocket aces cuz I don't know what

1469
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
How to think about my genetic makeup

1470
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,103
But I was born into the most incredible family ever and I was given the best

1471
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,919
Of all opportunities wanting for nothing

1472
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
Occasionally experientially

1473
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:58,623
The best mom the best dad the best sister and I've got the best wife so with all that and all the amazed

1474
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:02,975
Using groups of people I've been around I owe it to everyone

1475
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
To do something

1476
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,839
And at the end of the day the credit goes to them

1477
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,167
In so many ways

1478
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Eddie Dunn co founder of bonobos and he now runs the company as an employee

1479
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
Walmart Children's Apparel company started with a sister Monica is called Monica and an

1480
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
Andy Andy and Brian story is now used as a case study at Stanford Business School

1481
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,255
Including the email and he's sent to Brian that

1482
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,071
Eventually led to Brian leaving the company

1483
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,703
It's a sort of what to do and what not to do guide for new students

1484
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,551

1499
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,455
Timeout for how you built that and today story starts

1500
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
Skin Seattle

1501
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,039
Where Amy and Brady King run a construction

1502
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,367
Company together he's a general contractor so he builds the buildings and then

1503
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
I manage all the business side of things

1504
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,999
And a few years ago they were looking for new ways to expand

1505
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
We were we chatting about new businesses in inventing and coming up with new ideas and

1506
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,679
What are the things that

1507
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
Your other people feel like man

1508
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
Everything has been invented

1509
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,615
You know everything's been developed you know at times and that's that someone when you go that's

1510
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
I can't possibly be true

1511
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,223
It's already began thinking on his days as a firefighter

1512
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:05,599
He's seen a lot of really bad housing options for people who were displaced by those fires

1513
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,719
Is there floods or other natural disasters we talked about Katrina I think which is probably the

1514
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:17,375
The most obvious example of Disaster Response and kind of failure of housing PA

1515
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,655
People in those moments

1516
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:25,055
The start of the spark an idea Amy and Brady wondered how they could design a better shelter something

1517
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Prefabricated

1518
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,359
Portable secure

1519
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,383
And private

1520
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Shelters

1521
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,455
The cat house one family

1522
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
Idealistic

1523
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:38,879
Drop these in the neighborhoods after a tornado goes through like dropping into your neighborhoods in all the neighbors can

1524
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,671
Live in them for the first

1525
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,951
However many

1526
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,279
Your weeks or months and rebuild

1527
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
Bear neighborhood together

1528
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,167
And heal each other so what are background in construction

1529
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,727
Amy and Brady started building a prototype

1530
01:07:53,983 --> 01:08:00,127
Which basically looks like a small white square said it had Windows electricity and

1531
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,919
Laws that allowed for light

1532
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,967
To come in its eno8 feet

1533
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,783
Wide 8 feet long and about 10 feet tall

1534
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:11,391
It pops up in about 20 minutes no tools required

1535
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,975
And all of the panels are manufactured here and

1536
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:21,375
Made out of the material that's mold mildew and rot resistant so once I hit a working model Amy and Brady went to a tree

1537
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,655
Rachel where they met

1538
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Get first client

1539
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
Our very first customer was the city of Tacoma and actually

1540
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,567
The group that purchased from us was

1541
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:35,711
Their Emergency Management Department in the spring of 2017 and Tacoma Washington

1542
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:40,319
Adjust declared a state of emergency around the homeless crisis in their City

1543
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,415
And even though Amy and Brady design their shelters for natural disasters

1544
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,815
Their own employees help them realize why these shelters could have an entirely new purpose that's because

1545
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,119
Lots of the people in their construction crew

1546
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,447
I spent time in jail and I've been homeless in the past

1547
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,799
And they were saying you know when we were homeless there's the option to go to a shelter but

1548
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:07,455
Family can't stay together and I thought if we were homeless and they said okay your husband has to go over here and you and your

1549
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Your daughters are going to go over here I'd say

1550
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,319
No way I'm not doing that we're keeping our family together

1551
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,135
So now Indian Brady's construction business

1552
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:21,535
It not only employees those who were previously incarcerated or homeless their product directly serve that

1553
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,583
Same population we know we haven't

1554
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
Specific Mission and that mission is to create jobs for people who are traditionally marginalized in the employment

1555
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,383
World and our Focus population is primarily people who are transitioning out of incarceration or who have criminal justice involved

1556
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Women in their past

1557
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,479
As well as people coming off the streets out of homelessness

1558
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,879
Today Amy and Bradys clients are mainly cities looking to provide housing for the homeless there's a Humanity

1559
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
Indeed out there

1560
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,975
And if we can provide a solution to fill it

1561
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
Then we should at least

1562
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
See if it's something that we can do

1563
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,887
Any Brady Kings product

1564
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
