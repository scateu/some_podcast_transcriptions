Hey it's guy here and today I bring you our second

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
That was held in San Francisco in

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
In October

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,848
Episode is for my live interview with

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry there that co-founders of methadone

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,528
If you haven't heard that episode we did on methadone the podcast

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,088
You should definitely go back and give it a listen

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
It's the story of two guys in

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,976
Mid-twenties who took on Unilever and Procter & Gamble

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
Starting a company that makes

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Green cleaning products

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Adam and Eric Spencer

Building method

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Together

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
Before they each moved on to found do companies so

32
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
I really wanted to dig into

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,664
Just how they made their partnership work so successfully

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
How they manage their relationship

35
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Elf Rudolph

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
How they managed to stay friends

37
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
Thank you for for coming

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
I am imagining a lot of pee

39
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,816
People in this room maybe even in the bathrooms of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
They will find that iconic bottle

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Of method hand soap

42
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,800
Tell me how you got the idea can you tell us how the idea

43
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Can't you guys

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Go for it

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,712
So Adam and I started this company at Pine and Gough

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
Here in San Francisco

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Now referred to as lower Pacific

48
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
And arguably the dirtiest flat in San Francisco so this is not the Martha

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Stuart Story by

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
By any means

51
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
And it'll

52
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,656
We took a different approach which is not necessarily trying to find a problem to solve or frustration

53
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Cuz we are not known for our cleaning

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Especially Eric

55
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
We saw a really big category which

56
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
With a sea of sameness

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
And we started looking at the category and start to see some up

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Yeah Eric really kind of looked at it from a

59
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
From a brand for

60
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Perspective initially it was his background

61
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
And I have very different background

62
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Scientific Environmental

63
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
And

64
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Start looking at it from that

65
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
Perspective and it just was one of those things just started to grow

66
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
I wouldn't really know what it was

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
At first but it grew into like mid-twenties at the time

68
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,008
How did you know that the other person was

69
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Going to be the right

70
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Partner when you

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
When you bet money start

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Talking about this

73
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
I don't think

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
I don't I don't think we did

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
What I knew is that Eric

76
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Thought in a way that was

77
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Entirely different

78
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
From the way that I thought and I learned a lot

79
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
Whenever I spoke to him about business

80
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
I knew that that

81
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Was a necessary element

82
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Or any

83
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
And I'm just somebody that believes in

84
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Trying lifelong learning

85
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
And so

86
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
I saw that is a huge ass

87
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Yeah

88
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
We're so different in the way we think and what I

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Skill sets are

90
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
In a typical business situation I don't think we would ever been

91
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Brought together

92
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,016
What are the very lucky things for us is that we were friends and roommates

93
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
And

94
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
You as a Founder you off to look

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
To partner with businesses with people who are similar to you

96
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
But what you needed somebody to complete

97
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Opposite of you to make a a

98
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Yeah so tell me

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Both of you

100
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
What skill sets

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Did you bring to that partners

102
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Relationship

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
You can spell and do math

104
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
I was 25 when we started the business so I did I can't claim that I had a lot of skill set

105
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
Balancing chemical engineering I'd been a climate scientist

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
You know I knew how to

107
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Computer program I knew how to do

108
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Certitech

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Pickle stuff

110
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
And could figure out

111
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Problems

112
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
At very simply Adams inside the bottle he understood that

113
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
The chemistry to chemical engineering

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,471
The sustainability behind it and I was outside of the bottle which was the design and The Branding of it

115
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
And one of you and you may not

116
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,103
May not know who one of them is an introvert and one Xanax

117
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,783
We need each other difference between an introverted engineer

118
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Extroverted engineer

119
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
The extroverted engineer looks at your shoes

120
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
So

121
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
So

122
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
You guys obviously very different personalities

123
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Totally different skill sets

124
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
How did you figure out who was going to do

125
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
I think I kind of came pretty naturally

126
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,895
There is no way you can trust me to do chemical engineering

127
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Yeah I mean

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
The skill sets being so different we kind of had to spread out on the field but

129
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
Early on in startup you're doing everything right so Eric was

130
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,975
Didn't have any formal sales training for example but he was very much on the sales side of the business leading

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
Customer relationship development that sorta thing is it harder for you to do

132
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
You know

133
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
Yeah probably a little bit

134
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
It also required me to do things like learn Finance

135
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
I have no formal

136
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Whatsoever

137
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,407
But yeah that's that's typical more comfortable being in the background and letting Eric

138
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Kind of

139
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,271
Be the face of this to investors and partners and customers

140
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Yeah

141
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
Part of that surround my internal motivation which is

142
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
I think I am oriented the way that I am introverted if you want to call it that

143
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
But also I'm much more and it says try to commentary on Herrick

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,007
How much more just sort of internally motivated about trying to learn new things and get better at something

145
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
Get a little bit better every day it's Friday night

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
So yeah but I think that that

147
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
You know the kind of bring that around that's actually really important in a business

148
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Does that you have chef

149
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Controls that you can

150
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
That you can play and it actually

151
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
It was very much to our benefit.

152
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
Some of our very early

153
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
Sales pictures that we

154
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,631
We talked about on the show where Eric was out in the front of the customer and I was

155
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Kind of squirrel in a way trying to figure out

156
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Stuff in the meantime and

157
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Trying to get it all the

158
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Come together

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Arthritis

160
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
Yeah you know we had episodes

161
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Where the founders co-founders split up

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
It's bad you know it it's

163
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
It's actually more common than not

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,879
Your case is almost unusual because you're still friends you see each other even though you've gone

165
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Your separate ways we both have separate companies today which will

166
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,535
Adam must have been tension I mean that mean

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,607
They're still business decisions that have to be made there still

168
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Processes

169
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
So

170
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
How did you

171
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Yeah you're under extreme

172
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Stress and pressure

173
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,151
And you do this as a partnership and I always tell people it's it's a lot like a marriage but it's

174
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
It's even harder cuz you can have makeup sex

175
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
There's so much I could say right now

176
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
But so much of the tension of the two of us of these very complementary skills and you can see that

177
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Tension in art

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Are Brandon great brands have

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
Attentions right so we had to find healthy ways in

180
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
And I think we understood each other well as friends

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
And it took a few years but when we really learn to understand each other well as

182
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
As business partners

183
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,527
And what are different work styles were like and we could respect it and understand it

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
And then we were able to support each other

185
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
An acre

186
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Completely

187
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Different level

188
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
I just been amazing

189
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
I would just add to that

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
Fought like cats and dogs we hated each other's guts

191
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
And you live together

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
That's good

193
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
In in we actually kind of had to intervene in it

194
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
The key for us was

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
Recognizing that it was way more important

196
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
For the business

197
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
That we have a constructive relationship

198
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
To get our own individual way

199
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
And the big learning was

200
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,975
Because we're so different learning that when Eric

201
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Says something

202
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Yeah what he really needs and when I

203
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Say something he perceives it differently than what I'm trying

204
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
To say in example of that you are

205
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,591
I think you mentioned me I don't know if this ended up in the final version of podcasts you're very communicative your

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Kind of an open book and and sometimes

207
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
You describe the way that Adam

208
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Dealt with

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Challenges are pressures with

210
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Kind of

211
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
Internalized it'll stay quiet space that then get the energy to go attack the prophet you thought

212
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
He was angry with you

213
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Yea or withdrawn

214
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Blake Whiteley

215
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
You don't like the house is on fire and I was looking what he was doing and I didn't feel

216
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
He was having that same sense of urgency

217
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
Where he just needed to

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Approach it from a very different way

219
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Where when I'm under

220
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Pressure under stress

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
I have to attack the problem head-on

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
And that's

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Sperry classic introvert X

224
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
Did you ever get a coach or like a therapist or somebody else

225
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,207
Therapy together

226
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,887
I'm a big proponent of that because it's what helps you understand this like the situation that we do

227
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
You just talked about where

228
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
When things get stressful Eric talks-a-lot and Adam shuts up

229
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Right and that's

230
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Two different people

231
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
You responding in different ways that still need to work

232
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,711
Together in ways that are constructive even though they're stressful until

233
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
Having somebody to help you understand that

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,671
You know what Eric by talking a lot what he means you know not

235
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,279
You know trying to think my way through a problem that we kind of got to meet each other in the middle and use the best

236
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Cast of each other's skill set

237
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
I'm just really fascinated how you

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
We're so

239
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
Kind of mature about this you were so young and your

240
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,079
Mid-twenties mean in your mid-twenties are going through lots of things in general like you were going to do with my life

241
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Is this working out and yet

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,247
You both seem to just have this very single-minded focus on making this thing work

243
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
Yeah and I'm in a lot of that is driven by

244
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,695
What a lot of us are trying to do which is to create meaning for our work

245
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
Work right yeah we spent an awful lot of time working

246
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
And so if we can make it meaningful that's something

247
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
That

248
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
It has been a goal for our

249
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
For us all along and that means yeah putting putting yourself a little bit of side

250
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
Could you try to create something that's bigger than

251
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
You could ever be

252
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Yeah

253
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,711
What what do you think the difference between good tension and bad tension is right because

254
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Trust

255
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Distressed

256
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Why what's up

257
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Yeah

258
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
Ndk conflict can be good right now usually is

259
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Yeah yeah I mean

260
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
I say trust maybe that's obvious but

261
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,119
Conflict is a great thing because it's where you are able to build an idea into a bigger better idea

262
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
And

263
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
You're going to have differences of opinion

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
And

265
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,847
Trust is what allows you to evaluate that objectively as

266
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Something that's

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,967
A better way of solving a problem that your business has or a better idea than the one that

268
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Susie or Bobby came up with all by him or herself

269
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
Where there isn't trust that's when

270
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
You know things get weird

271
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Do you know authorship

272
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
Becomes more important than

273
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Quality Inn

274
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
All kinds of sea

275
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,143
Look for people in this audience for early-stage entrepreneurs and trying to build something and maybe thinking about a co-founder

276
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Maybe they have

277
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Cocoa powder there's a small team

278
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
What would you have wanted to know

279
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
You know

280
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
20 years ago

281
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,687
That would have been helpful for you as you've now grown and scaled your own business

282
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
I mean I always encourage people take a partner because

283
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
It's one thing to let yourself down

284
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Really hard to let someone else

285
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And that partner

286
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
You keep each other going when things get really hard wood

287
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Which they always will

288
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
And then I was encouraged people to to find somebody who's just the

289
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Sweet opposite

290
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Of your skill-set

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
So between the two of you you can cover as much of of the

292
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
The business has

293
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,335
Yeah and go into it with an open mind because I think you'll learn

294
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
More about yourself

295
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Then anything else

296
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
In terms of

297
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,111
What you're good at and what you're not good at how you're perceived and how ultimately you can be effect

298
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Then how you can lead p

299
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
In a way that's not true and authentic

300
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Take to type

301
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
I asked you earlier

302
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Both of you how did you know

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
Set the other person was the right person and your answer was we didn't

304
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
So

305
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
Was it I mean was it just serendipitous that you just

306
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,127
I think yeah a little bit of luck and you know a startup is a journey

307
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
Any kind of figure out along the way

308
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
And if Adam it started

309
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Method on its own it

310
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Private eye look like

311
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
The Birkenstock

312
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Smell

313
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
It smells like one

314
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,047
Edify start On My Own by look like Hello Kitty

315
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
And we've been toxic did work

316
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
And because of

317
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Us coming together and bringing

318
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
These different points of view in the strengths we created I get with cats

319
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Jennifer cuz we haven't found anybody who did it first but really the first Sikh Osheaga

320
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Product

321
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,271
I design a deep sustainability

322
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Which is really hard to do

323
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
And we are both insistent that it would have these

324
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
These qualities in and brought it's a lot of our personality coming together

325
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
A big part of it as well as making the commitment that hey I'm going to start this business right you start a business that's at least

326
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Least a 10-year commitment

327
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
And

328
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
I'm going to do it with this person which

329
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
You know I mean we're using the marriage analogy a lot right you

330
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
It's something you've got to commit to not just

331
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,967
The way it starts but how you're going to develop it over time so that you can

332
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Can make it work

333
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Work to the benefit of the business

334
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
And then I think the key is always put the business

335
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Before

336
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
Yourself and if you do that it'll bring you back around to that

337
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,999
When you know he said something that gets on your nerves or

338
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
You know there's a

339
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
This is breakthrough therapy

340
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,031
You you are both running your own business is now you useful method and you're no longer involved with the company

341
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Eric you run Ali which is a

342
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Vitamins and nutritional supplements pricing at Target and ripply pricing at all over the place Whole Foods as well it's a

343
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Plant milk company

344
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
What do you most miss about

345
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Not about not working with the other person

346
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Eric's creative spelling

347
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,399
In all seriousness Eric is one of the best people I've ever met in

348
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Just kind of coming up with

349
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
We're really building on ideas

350
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
Little nuggets that sort of get built into

351
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,383
More interesting and

352
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
And creative ideas

353
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
Yeah well I just missed her sense of humor

354
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
We always had a lot of fun together

355
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
In the office

356
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
I miss that pet healthy Panther like brothers from

357
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Different mother

358
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
I love how Adam

359
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,071
Push these really hard initiatives around

360
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Sustainability or

361
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Chemical engineering

362
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
That would scare us all that we get behind it I think it was

363
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
Plastic was one of my more favorite ones as well.

364
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
Launch a line of products that were made

365
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
From

366
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
