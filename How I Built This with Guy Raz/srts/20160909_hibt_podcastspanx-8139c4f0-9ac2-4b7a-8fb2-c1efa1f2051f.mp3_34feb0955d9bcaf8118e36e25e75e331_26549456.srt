Blakely was growing up

24

Florida

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Exactly

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Dream of

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Door to door

37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Feeling

38
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
More life

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
With all the rejection and

40
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Daddy here where you at

41
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
It was like water outfits

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Duckback

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh my gosh no I

44
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
Would feel very defeated and many times I would

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,480
Get in my car and drive around the block multiple times you know just trying to convince myself

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
To walk through the door

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,136
And sometimes I'd walk through the door and they were small offices were the whole office would turn and look at me at the

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Same time it helps

49
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
I'm something to completely lose my nerve and just say oh sorry I'm I'm in the wrong place and turn around and walk out so

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
I stumbled my way through it believe me

51
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,960
And I know it sounds crazy but what I was selling fax machines door-to-door I

52
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie you know where's the director where's the where's the producer of this is not my

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
My movie and I was really

54
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Determined to create a better life

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
So how did working there

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Like help you discover

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
What it was you worship

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
That that was

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
When I first started wearing Hosiery daily and I realized him figured out what the control top

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
Top portion of the Hosiery was doing for me in my

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
I closed it was really making my clothes

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
It's so much better

63
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
But I had spent money on a pair of cream pants

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
Spent $98 on them which for me was a lot of money

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,456
And they just hung in my closet on Warren because every time I would go to wear them you could see the undergarment

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Regular underwear left

67
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
The panty line

68
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,880
The song wasn't a great solution it also left marks that you could see and then

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
That shapewear was

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
So it was like the girls were so sick and overdone

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
And I saw an opportunity for something right in the middle that was just

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Create the perfect canvas undergarment

73
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
For women

74
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
And I guess I should say for people who've never worn

75
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
It's like this is an

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Undergarment made out of

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
An elastic material

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Basically

79
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Titans and

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Snooze everything around you

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Your butt and thighs

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Yes

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,088
And so when I cut the feet out of my own control top pantyhose so I can wear those cream pants the light bulb went off

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
And then I started pursuing the idea

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Like how to use an

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Started

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Build a business

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Did you have any money to do

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
At the Capitol

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
You have wealthy friends are for

91
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Family

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
I had set aside $5,000 in savings from selling fax machine Store to Door and that's what I saw

93
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Started Spanx with

94
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
And so the first thing I did was

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Started to

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Research if the idea exists

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,736
Dead and I went to the Georgia Tech Library in Atlanta every night after work for

98
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
A week and a half

99
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Researching every pantyhose patent that ever exist

100
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
And then probably on the 7th or 10th day of me being in there some guy came up to me cuz you know there's a way

101
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,863
Website called USPTO. Govt and I said no what is that I scribbled out of my notebook he's like

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,215
You can search your put in a patent and it'll search for you so

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,079
That website became one of my best friends and once I determined that there wasn't anything

104
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
That existed

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
In a patent form

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,223
And then wanted to see if there was any Market appetite for it Beyond Myself

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,343
I literally went and asked one person I went to the Neiman Marcus down the street from my apartment

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
Went in and asked the sales associate if

109
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,279
She thought anybody would ever want something like a footless pantyhose to wear Underpants

110
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,679
And her face lit up and she goes yes in fact I have lots of customers who've been making their own homemade version of that

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,263
Because there's no right under garment to wear under a lot of their clothes

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
And that was my whole focus group guy

113
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,455
That's it okay there's a market to me

114
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
Had you ever

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Sone NE

116
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Were you to do a back

117
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Cannon design

118
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Manufacturer

119
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Sure Staff

120
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
No

121
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
What did you do how did

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
You can start of things

123
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
Figure out what material you needed to use I've never sewn I have never taken a business class in my life I didn't

124
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,567
And have anybody in the industry or even know anybody that it worked in fashion or retail

125
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
And so what happened when I

126
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Came up with the idea is I just started

127
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Taking other

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Pantyhose

129
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
And then I went to Hancock Fabrics down the street and all these

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Different arts and crafts

131
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Stores and started trying to

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Paper clip

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,231
Different pieces of elastic to the bottom and different pieces of lace

134
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,375
And you know obviously didn't get very far and my idea actually needed to be made on him

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,727
Machine and that's why I really needed a manufacturer to give me the time of day

136
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
To see if I could even make the

137
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
And in the meantime

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
You are

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
You still selling

140
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Yeah because I needed the money

141
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Coming in and

142
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,319
The health insurance in all all that comes with that so I was working on my idea at night and on the weekends

143
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
And when I kept calling all the manufacturers that I found that were mostly ignored

144
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
North Carolina on the phone and not getting anywhere

145
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
I mean no one would tell

146
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
My call or they didn't

147
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
You know I just learned from my cold calling days you got to be there in person

148
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
I took a week off of work

149
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
And drove snort

150
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
North Carolina

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
And just started cold

152
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Calling Manufacturing

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Showed up and said

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Yes

155
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
So I walked in the door just cold and just said hi I'm here to meet

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
CDL owner in their life

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
And you are

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
They always ask you the same three questions it's 8 and you are and I say is terribly

159
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Faye and

160
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
You're with

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Headspace

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Sara Blakely

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,095
And you're financially backed by Sara Blakely

164
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,215
I'm thinking imagine how that meeting Matt and I must have been more like have a nice day it's great to meet you you know

165
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Were they just not

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Interested in the idea at all

167
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
We have the manufacturing plants didn't get it at all and I found it very interesting that all I was meeting with for men and then it kind

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,759
And it became clear to be why they probably been so uncomfortable for so

169
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Because the people that were making them more

170
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Spending all day in them

171
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
You know and so it if they were they were not admitting it

172
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
So I had a hard time explaining why this product

173
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
So important and

174
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
They couldn't wrap their minds around I was

175
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Basically coming in and disrupting an entire industry been looking at something in one way and they want to decline year after

176
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,519
To hear they were making Hosiery to be seen on the leg

177
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
And I knocked on their door and said guys

178
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
I just want your hosiery material

179
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
And I don't need it to be seen anywhere

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,015
Actually going to be hidden under clothes it's a new type of undergarments

181
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
So how did you convince

182
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Manufactured

183
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
To take you on to make

184
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Well it took a few visits

185
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
To North Carolina and a lot of

186
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Really persistent

187
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
They all sent me away at first

188
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
And a couple weeks after I left one manufacturer Highland Mills in Charlotte North Carolina the owner called me

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Eddie said Sarah is Sam

190
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
I've decided to help make your crazy idea

191
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
And I just pause that I was about to jump out of my chair and I said really why why the change of Hearts them and all he said is

192
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
I have three daughters

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,903
And so later I found out when I got the chance to do it that he had run the idea by his

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Three daughters over dinner and they said Dad this is actually a really good idea we think you should

195
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Give this girl a shot

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,191
And he still didn't understand it or think it was a good idea but he said that my enthusiasm in Like Mike

197
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,007
Confidence and how good this idea was going to be

198
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Stuck with him

199
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Do you know about what you were doing

200
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
No sew

201
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
When I came up with the idea

202
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
I kept it a secret for one year

203
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,391
I did share my idea with people like manufacturers or lawyers are people that I thought

204
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Help me bring my product

205
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
To life

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,047
But I was very careful right away was just a gut feeling I had

207
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
To keep it to myself

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
Because I believe that ideas are the most vulnerable in their infancy

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
And

210
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
It's interesting to turn to your right or left in that moment until a friend or tell your husband

211
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,407
And you know when you do that instantly egos invited into the mick

212
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
And then you end up spending all your time defending it

213
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Explaining it

214
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
I'm not pursuing it so

215
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,647
I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't turn back no matter what I heard

216
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
I had invested enough of my time and

217
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
I had enough Sweat Equity into the idea

218
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
That I'd I told people and the things I heard where you know a honey if it's such a good idea why isn't somebody else

219
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Already done it

220
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,311
And we'll leave if it is a good idea Sarah you know you're going to spend your savings on this and then sick

221
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Six months the big guys will just knock you out of the water and

222
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
That was all coming from a place of love but I feel like if I had heard that

223
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,063
The night that I cut the feet out of my panties I probably still be selling stocks

224
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Machine

225
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
So once

226
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
You started

227
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Amethyst

228
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Felt was really

229
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Special like

230
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Did you

231
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Did you begin the process of

232
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Getting it patented

233
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
I did so I went to

234
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
The three different law firms

235
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,287
I couldn't find a single female patent attorney in the state of Georgia and I even called the Georgia

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Chamber of Commerce and they said there isn't Fun

237
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,735
So I said okay I'm going to do my best to explain his two to three men let's see what happens and

238
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
You know they were very nice they were

239
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
Not super impressed probably with the idea and they they all quoted me between 3 and $5,000

240
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Catnip

241
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
So I decided to write it myself

242
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,911
And I went to Barnes & Noble on Peachtree in Atlanta and bought a book called patents and trademarks

243
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
And I wrote the patent

244
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,287
And then my mom's an artist and so I asked her if she would

245
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Catch me in the Prototype

246
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,175
It for the patent and that is the picture of the US patent and trademark office

247
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,063
But I went back to the one lawyer who gave me a little bit more of time of day than the other ones

248
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
And I said listen Dan

249
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
I have written my own patent

250
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
I have done all of the work except for the claim

251
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,047
That is the part that I am not trained for I don't understand how to do that

252
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Please I need your ex

253
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Proteases are any chance you would do it for a discounted price

254
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
And he was blown away go to Britain basically the entire patent yes

255
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,823
For $750 I'll do it over a weekend and I'll write the claims

256
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Portion of your pad

257
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
So you

258
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
So then you got

259
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Yes but you know there was a moment in this journey that was

260
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Quite funny I

261
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
When we're in the final stages of the claims

262
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,903
The lawyer said Sarah there is I need to know it's technically in the Garment from a

263
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Fiber and yarn level

264
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Okay

265
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
Only one person to call on that nut

266
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,887
Ted and Ted would have become my friend in the back of the manufacturing plant North Carolina and Ted had

267
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
The most

268
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Thick southern accent you've ever heard in your life

269
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
I mean it was intense and so

270
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,383
I called Ted on the phone I said Ted my lawyers on the phone and we're trying to finalize

271
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
Cotton can you tell me exactly what's in the Garmin

272
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
He's like yeah

273
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,551
They're 70% nylon and 30% lacquer

274
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Okay great and so my lawyer and I are riding and I could thanks Ted and I'm up all night guy the night before I submit my patent to the

275
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
US patent and trademark office and I'm thinking

276
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
How is there lacquer in this

277
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
This product like

278
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
How is that possible

279
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,239
So I called Ted the next morning and I said Ted is Sarah we weave

280
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Spell

281
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799

282
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455

00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Okay okay okay thanks

Call my lawyer on my do an oil change on lacquer it's Lycra

285
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
And he laughed so hard because you know fast you would have got no patents are on trying to make pantyhose out of paint thinner and like

Hey it's how I built this from NPR

329
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
I'm guy Raz

330
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Took this point in our story

331
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Sara Blakely has

332
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Designed a new kind of

333
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Shapewear

334
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
And then

335
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Want to take get it out into the market

336
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
The first

337
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Come up with a name

338
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
The name was a journey that since the time I cut the feet out of my pantyhose. Tell the time I launched it in stores with

339
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
2 years

340
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,479
And I've been writing names on scrap pieces of paper everywhere I was

341
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
Casino in most of the names were on the back of rental car agreement

342
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
Because I had great thinking and in cars

343
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,975
And I wasn't getting anywhere with that I didn't like any of the names and I knew it wasn't right

344
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
And then I sort of narrow down my thinking at one point in time and thought Kodak and Coca-Cola are the two most recognized

345
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
Names in the world what do they have in common

346
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
They both had a strong case down to them

347
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
And I had

348
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,359
Friends that were stand-up comedians and I knew that the k sound makes your audience laugh

349
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
So I just called it together

350
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
I know I don't know but it said it's a known Trade Secret of Mana

351
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Comedian

352
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,135
And so I thought you know what I need to have my invention have the k sound in it for good luck

353
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
And almost as soon as I neared my thinking down that way the words

354
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
Spanx came to me while I was in my car

355
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
I saw the word across

356
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,447
Like in my mind across the dashboard of my car and I pulled off the side of the road and I thought

357
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
That's it

358
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
And I went home that night I didn't tell anybody

359
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
And I wrote down spa and chaos

360
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
And I went on USPTO. Govt at I sit in and I sat there and stared at it for a while and at the last minute I

361
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Backspace

362
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And deleted the K in the ass

363
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
And put in an app

364
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,487
I dread that made up words to better for products than real words do and they're easier to trademark

365
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
And even though it did actually have the cake and it had still the case down and so I felt great about it and the name is just right it's

366
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
My product was all about the rear end

367
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
And it's about making the rear end look better and no panty lines and so the word spanks was kind of naughty and kind of

368
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,711
Funny and a little bit risky and it just all work tonight and I hit send and

369
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
150 dollars

370
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
Took my credit card and then a couple months later I got back an official certificate from the government thing that I was the proud owner of

371
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
The word space

372
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
Okay so you've got a manufacturer

373
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Patents

374
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Anime

375
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
How did you

376
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
My very first account that I called on was Neiman Marcus

377
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
How did you

378
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Even

379
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Get in there

380
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
I called them

381
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Guy I just called them

382
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
I went in the Yellow Pages and I looked up the Neiman Marcus number in Atlanta and I said hi I'm Sarah and visitor Prada

383
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,951
How can I come and show it to you in the lady laughs and goes up man we have a buying office and it's in Dallas

384
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
I said oh well what's their number

385
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
So she gave me their number and I started calling them

386
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
And I just kept calling and trying to get

387
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
To the Hosiery buyer and I called for days at different times and she answered the phone and I took my shot and I said hey

388
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,895
Hi I'm Sara Blakely and I invented a product that is going to change the way your customers were closed

389
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
And if you give me a few minutes of your time I'll fly to Dallas

390
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
And show you

391
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
What you say

392
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
She said

393
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Well if you're willing to fly here I'll give you 10 minutes of my time

394
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
And I said great

395
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
And I jumped on a plane and I flew to Dallas

396
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
And I was in the meeting with her and she was this beautiful woman impeccably-dressed I'm at the Neiman Marcus headquarters I have a z

397
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
Ziploc bag for my kitchen with a prototype in it

398
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,311
A color copy of the packaging that I've created on my friends computer

399
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
And

400
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
My lucky red backpack from college that all of my friends begged me not to

401
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,295
You cannot go to the Neiman Marcus headquarters with that red

402
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Eastpak old

403
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
Dingy backpack I said yes it's my good luck charm I have to admit they were

404
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Really pleading with me

405
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
So what happened in the middle of my meeting with her I could tell I was losing her and I just knew it was my one shot so

406
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Did you know what Diane

407
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Will you come with me to the bath

408
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
And she just paused because excuse me I go I know I know it's a little bit we just please come with me to the bathroom I want to show

409
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Show you

410
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
My own products

411
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Before and after

412
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
And she she said okay if you walk down the hall with me and I went in the stall and I had on my cream pants that were the reason I

413
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
I invented this

414
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,047
Without Spanx on and then I went in the stall and put Spanx on underneath and came out and she looked him and she goes

415
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Wow I get it

416
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Brilliant

417
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,495
And she said I'm going to place an order and I'm going to put it in 7 stores and see how it goes

418
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:55,359
I couldn't believe it I got in the car and I was shaking

419
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:02,015
And I called Sam from the manufacturing plant Lego Sam Sam is Sarah I need more I just landed Neiman

420
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Markesan

421
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,903
He posited there's nothing on the other end of the phone for assume like a minute

422
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
Sam are you there

423
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Is Tara

424
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
Don't take this the wrong way but I thought you were to give these away as Christmas gifts or something for the next like

425
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
5 years what do you mean Neiman Marcus just took it on my Neiman Marcus just took it in ID more

426
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,359
Okay so you are in

427
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Neiman Marcus

428
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Are you thinking

429
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
Oh my gosh that is the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make

430
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
That is when the work begins

431
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
Personally I paid people basically friends to go buy the product and create a buzz about it because I was like you know a

432
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
I got to have these things move off

433
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
The shell for the

434
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Buyers not going to give me any any more chance

435
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Sweet you

436
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Paid people to buy them

437
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Yes

438
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,007
I called every friend I had in all the Seven Cities that Neiman's

439
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Sent

440
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
The Spanks to

441
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
And called friends that I hadn't even spoken to since fourth grade and you know kind of like hide Sarah remember me from 4th grade

442
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,319
Do you mind going to the store and buying thanks and I'll send you a check

443
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
And

444
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
It was really tough because I was one item

445
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
In a bin a department

446
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,327
And a new brand and I didn't even get a whole row in the Hosiery Department I got a pocket

447
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
So

448
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,679
I needed to do whatever I could to maximize this chance

449
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
And I went

450
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
To the stores and I

451
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,615
Would explain what the product was I would demo it I shut the before-and-after picture that my friend took

452
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,503
And then I would stand in the store from 9 when they opened until about 5 or 6

453
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Everyday

454
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Basically doing

455
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Everything

456
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Yeah and

457
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
I realized that one of the biggest challenges I had

458
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,999
Was that where my product was being sold in the store

459
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,119
Was an issue is being sold in the Hosiery department and my customer was in the shoe department

460
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
And she was in the ready-to-wear department

461
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
And so I started

462
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,335
Realizing I got I have a challenge I've got to get my product out of the department it's supposed to be sold in

463
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Tohatchi how'd you do that well I went to Target and I bought

464
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Stan's

465
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
You know free envelopes

466
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
And I ran around the store and put them at every

467
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Cash register

468
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,928
And everybody thought somebody else approved it so they kept them there for a while

469
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Neiman Marcus

470
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Moving your life

471
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
How to spank

472
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
To the cash register and they just assumed that that was like

473
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Some high ropes

474
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Said yeah do that

475
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,472
Other than that how are you

476
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
People know about it

477
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,128
It was a lot of a lot of hard work for me to get the word out I mean I've never advertised

478
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
Spanx is 15 years old and we've never done any formal ad

479
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,296
Campaign or anything is so it's a very Word of Mouth brand

480
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
No money

481
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
You had to get the word out

482
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
And you

483
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
You did things like

484
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
I ready

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,488
The Oprah yeah I did I sent it to Oprah with a note and

486
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,584
Turns out she ended up picking it is her favorite product of the year how did she even

487
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Find it in the

488
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Isles of males

489
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
Well I found out that Andre

490
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Her hairdresser.

491
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
And

492
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Put them in her dress

493
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
And she tried him and

494
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Put them on and

495
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
Has basically warned him everyday since

496
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Also went

497
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
She liked

498
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Pick up on them.

499
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Order Starbucks

500
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
Cover shipping pantyhose the women are the Spanx all across the world basically from my apart

501
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,792
So that's an enormous opportunity and then another thing I made a decision that was really

502
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
You know unconventional at the time

503
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
I decided to go on QVC

504
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
The TV channel.

505
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
The Shopping Channel

506
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Yeah and

507
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
Had a lot of people say Sarah your brand is at Bergdorf Goodman to Neiman Marcus you can't also sell on QVC Live killing

508
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Your brand and I just

509
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
I just had guys

510
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm going to be the one on QVC and

511
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,296
I'm going to control the message and it's going to give me an opportunity

512
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,624
Explain what this is and you know I felt confident in that

513
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
And they gave me five minutes of airtime

514
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
And

515
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
I sold 8000 pairs of Spanx

516
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
In 5 minutes

517
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
And that was after

518
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,680
You know a year of standing in department stores across the

519
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:09,056
The Country Inn on a really good day I'd sell between you know 35 270 parrot

520
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
In a day

521
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
And in sales muscle

522
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Muscle ache keep going up

523
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Cuz I read that

524
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
By the end of your second hear you

525
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
Like 10 million dollars

526
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
So did that feel

527
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
It was great

528
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
It was great

529
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
I never was doing it for the money you know so I wasn't really that ever that focused on it I mean I can even remember after a cup

530
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Couple years of

531
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
Thanks I'm still in my apartment and my accountant kept trying to convince me to buy a house and I was like I'm not interested

532
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
My little brother was always calling and telling me different ways to

533
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,480
And I just it was really just for the art of it like I loved I loved being able

534
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Pay my own rent

535
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
It's tantamount

536
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
2 feet of the woman that was a really important thing for myself

537
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
But it was really just I love making the product

538
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
Did you have

539
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Early on.

540
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Listen you got to

541

Help you

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,704
Yeah I did I had all kinds of

547
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,032
Things coming at me in the beginning and still do you know if

548
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
15 years later but

549
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
I remember one of the most

550
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,432
Interesting was within the first 6 months I started having several

551
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
People come up to me and say what's your ex

552
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,648
And I had no idea what they were talking about cuz I've never taken a business class

553
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
And it dawned on me that people actually start things just

554
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
The seldom

555
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Still on

556
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Yes

557
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Did you ever think

558
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
No

559
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
I was always nervous but I was always so connect

560
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
The product when I was so

561
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
I was so creating this

562
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Before it happened

563
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688

Fax machine Store to Door

565
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
I was

566
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
I was thinking about it I was writing about it at

567
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
I was visualizing it I was

568
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Preparing for it

569
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,696
I thought you know I don't have the most money I don't have a business

570
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
The grey I have no idea what I'm doing

580
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
You see that number that word

581
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes it's very weird it reminds me of in middle school there

582
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
Used to be these things in the malls where you could go in and picks up magazine cover you wanted to

583
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,440
I'll go in the booth and we'd smile and then we'd be on the cover of Vogue or whatever

584
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
I just did it feels very surreal
