Define your

Perfect pear

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,040
As Zappos was growing

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
It was also losing my money and we also need more money for inventory and so all this was happening at a bat

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
Time in terms of the.com Crash back in 2002 is pretty much impossible to raise money from

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Anyone you could not get as an investment and also even if someone wanted to invest in in

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,056
The last thing they wanted to do was invested

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
Online shoe company

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
No one would ever buy shoes online

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Robin PRP it's how I built this a show of that innovators entrepreneurs idealist

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
Stories behind the movements they built

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
I'm guy Roz and how old school mail-order catalogs inspired Tony hsieh to build one

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
The world's biggest online shoe retailers

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
You know it as Zappos

23
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Billions

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
You only have four pairs of shoes is that the right

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah roughly maybe maybe fewer now

26
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
But what kind of shoes are you wearing now

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
Right now I'm wearing black ASICS

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
I have a

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
I'm actually not passed about shoes at all

30
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
I'm passing out

31
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Servicing Company closer so I can

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Talk forever about

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Those two things but I can't

34
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Say anything. Shoes Okay so as you just heard one of the most successful shoe salesman in the world

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Some care about shoes

36
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
And also

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,976
He's really quiet he said he's an introvert right definitely

38
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,536
How do you cope with a huge company like

39
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
Inspire them like how do you find the

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
Energy to do that

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
I'm probably different from a lot of

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Liberal CEOs where I like to use the analogy of Imagine a greenhouse where maybe at

43
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Cool

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Company

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Paseo

46
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Ibiza

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
Strongest and tallest

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Most charismatic plant that all the other plants

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Strive to

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Monday

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Become baby

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
And for me I really

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Taking my

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Role as more about being the

55
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
Architect of the greenhouse

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,704
The other plants inside will flourish and thrive on their own and so from a

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
I guess company perspective by charges

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,408
Surround myself with people that are just naturally more extroverted

59
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,272
We're too because I heard that when you apply to Zappos you actually you're asked how weird you are

60
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
I believe so I think our

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
Application form evolves baidu

62
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
As far as I know.

63
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
That question still there

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
So on a scale of 1 to 10 how weird are you

65
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
I would

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Say maybe in

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
8

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
Okay there you have it

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,568
Tony Chabot the guy who built this huge company with more than a thousand employees

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Doesn't really like shoes he's an 8 on the weird scale

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
An introvert

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
People who study companies and Company culture

73
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,160
Come from all over the world to Zappos to 2/10 quarters in Las Vegas to see how it operates

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
Because as many of you know at Zappos

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,096
There are no typical bosses employees have a lot of autonomy to make decisions

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,192
But at the same time there's an obsessiveness about customer service and back

77
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
As you will hear Zappos doesn't even think of itself as a shoe company

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
But basically

79
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Is a company that sells good customer service

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
The story of

81
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
How Tony got there

82
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
Begins as these stories often to

83
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
In childhood

84
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
Your typical Asian-American parents always

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
Practicing piano and violin and other instruments and

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
During the Summers for example practice 1 hour

87
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Channel 1 hour violin and

88
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Emphasis

89
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
You have two kids summer vacation and so

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
I was actually

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Get up super early

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
And

93
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
I would actually just

94
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Playback recording of

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Myself playing the piano

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Violin

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,063
What you would play a recording of you practicing the violin to give your parents an impression that you were

98
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Actually practicing the violin

99
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Right so because they were

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
Sleeping but they get here so

101
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
So that was my

102
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Way around that is like a Ferris Bueller movie

103
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
And strangely

104
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
Every week when I went to piano lessons or violin lessons I never improved

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
And so the teachers I had understand why

106
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
So anyway Tony eventually goes up

107
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
College graduates in the mid-1990s

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,015
And it's not like he goes right into starting Zappos

109
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
The first

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
He goes to work for Oracle as a low-level programmer

111
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,743
I wasn't there for very long I think I was there for five months and it's just straight out of college and

112
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
The actual work I was assigned to do was

113
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Pretty

114
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Boring ass

115
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
This is right about when

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
The internet and the World Wide Web

117
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Started cuz I remember it didn't even

118
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Really exist I don't think

119
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Before or at least two summers before

120
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
And at the time these web design and hosting agencies were popping up left and right answer

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,111
Sanjay and I decided to

122
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,719
Do that on the side while we were both our day jobs were at Oracle but during lunch breaks in it

123
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Would go

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,143
Start selling and designing websites for different local small businesses so you guys are like doing a side Hustle

125
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
Yeah and then we had this idea for

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
But at the time advertising on online

127
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,359
Very very rare at In-N-Out near today if you go to

128
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Any website

129
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Seattle

130
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Play Spit

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Back in the day

132
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
If you went to the website and it had an advertising

133
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
Actually kind of badge of honor because only the really big but sites

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Like Yahoo

135
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,815
Have never dies in customers so you guys were trying to act like a web-based ad sales company

136
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Original we didn't really Ashley

137
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Intend to start his businesses

138
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Find those things we were bored and

139
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,799
Let's try this and see what happens and so we literally just

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
Contacted to a hundred random websites.

141
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
We thought were interesting

142
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
And how would you even contact

143
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Reba

144
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Casino them cuz

145
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Back then people

146
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183
Alright. Com

147
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
What was your pitch when you email them

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
Basically that we're trying this thing out and

149
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,911
If you just put this little piece of code into the your website banners will start showing up and

150
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
You send us your banner and

151
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
Make sure that it's showing up on other website

152
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
The same thing that was

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
We weren't really trying to

154
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Pet Shop

155
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Virginia

156
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
Participate you basically got like a lot of small websites to join

157
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Kind of a network and then agree to run ads on their site

158
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
And you were like the middle that right you sold those spaces on websites

159
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Two companies that want to advertise

160
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Yeah

161
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
Wow so incredibly good time

162
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Hanover

163
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
Two and a half years we end up going to come here

164
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Chicago link Exchange

165
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
It's about a hundred or so people

166
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
And then

167
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Ultimately ended up selling the

168
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Connect to Microsoft

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
In

170
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
1998

171
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
4

172
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
265

173
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Okay first of all Tony

174
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
This is not how this narrative is supposed to go

175
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
I mean you are so young and this is just three years after you graduate from college so

176
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
I totally overwhelming that that that that happened so quickly

177
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
The whole thing definitely seen

178
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,935
Very surreal but at the same time

179
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
What a lot of people don't know is the real reason why we ended up selling the

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
The company

181
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
And

182
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
The real reason was because

183
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Company culture

184
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
I've gone completely downhill

185
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
And I myself try to getting out of bed in the morning to go to my own company

186
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
You just kind of weird

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Feeling because when I was

188
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Viber

189
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
We were all friends

190
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
A lot of fun we were

191
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Kind of your typical.com startup back then we were sleeping under desk

192
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Had no idea

193
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Weekly was working around the clock but it is

194
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Really exciting and

195
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Going in as we started

196
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
Hiring more and more people we eventually ran out of

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
Either friends or friends of friends and

198
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
So how to do

199
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
How to do interviews

200
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
And so on in

201
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Not everyone we hired was

202
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Good Burger

203
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Children by the time we got to a hundred

204
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
People

205
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
It wasn't anyone's

206
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
I was just

207
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Death by a thousand

208
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Is 100

209
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Supercuts in

210
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
That's really what led to the sale

211
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Soap silhouette

212
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
You just like cashed out and moved on

213
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Well in Silicon Valley

214
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Muesli

215
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
There's a four-year

216
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
Soon as a 4 year vesting for

217
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Deer stocking

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
I'd only been there for a 2 and 1/2 years

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
So

220
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Really had to stay for another

221
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
You're in a half after Microsoft

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
Acquired Us in order to get

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
The full amount

224
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
What the deal

225
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
It was structured for it but I ended up

226
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
You away from

227
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
That way

228
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
I guess I could have easily just sat around

229
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
For your nap

230
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Buddy 2

231
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
So just to be clear you you could have made

232
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
Much more money if you had stayed for like

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
Another year-and-a-half but you walked away because you were miserable

234
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,359
Yeah I think I just started going down the path of just trying to make sure that I

235
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Being true to myself and doing things

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Because

237
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
It's what I want to do versus what is

238
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Maybe

239
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
A status symbol

240
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Or

241
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
What Society

242
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Xvideo

243
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
I ain't the one resource that we all

244
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
We have the same constraints

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Time

246
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
So

247
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Didn't want to do

248
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Okay so fair enough

249
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Keep you part ways with linky

250
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Exchange

251
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,799
An Endeavor that you open an incubator like where you invested in other companies

252
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah

253
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Adventure frog

254
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
And we raised about 27 million I'd say

255
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Roughly half of that was

256
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
My money and then the other half was from

257
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Other early

258
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Link exchange employees

259
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Add money from the acquisition

260
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
And for me when I first

261
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,815
Got started in my thinking was so this will be lots of fun

262
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,399
Lots of different Founders in different internet company

263
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
But what I realized was that for me actually found that investing was pretty boring and I felt like I was sitting on the

264
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
Sidelines all the time and I really miss being part of

265
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,247
Building something

266
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Almost actually didn't get on a radar because

267
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
I remember getting a voicemail

268
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
From

269
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Founders apus

270
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Nick swinmurn in

271
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,047
He said he had this idea for selling shoes online and we were getting random pictures

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Everyday and so to me

273
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Sing like me

274
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
How's your toddler bad

275
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Who's going to actually

276
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Try on shoes without seeing them in in person

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
And

278
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Right before

279
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Hitting the delete button on a Honda

280
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
IG thread

281
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
Facts that made us change your mind one was that Footwear

282
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
At the time was

283
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
40 billion dollar a year industry in the US yeah

284
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
And I'm not into shoes at all so that was

285
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
News to me

286
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
And then the other interesting fact was that at the time mail-order catalogs

287
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Paper catalogs

288
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
That

289
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Was actually the fastest growing segment of the Footwear industry in the US and that represent of 5% SO2

290
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
2 billion dollars a year

291
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
And growing

292
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
And there's

293
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Clear proof that people are going to

294
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Remotely

295
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Try on shoes

296
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
And so

297
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
In our minds. Okay to use the Internet is going to be

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Much bigger than just paper

299
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Order have uggs and so

300
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
That's what made us ultimately decide to invest

301
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,583
Okay so when when the founder of Zappos mixed with swinburne

302
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Can I meet you guys for the first time

303
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
What was your impression of

304
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
He just seemed like a pretty

305
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,543
Casual guy but he just said since you

306
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
Nick don't have any Footwear background

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Ambassador

308
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Can find a shoe guy

309
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Turn that that

310
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
There's a shoe guy name

311
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Fred Mosley

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
Was working at Nordstrom at the time and

313
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
He told Nick

314
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
I'll join it

315
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
You find an investor and so

316
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Are we all

317
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Not in

318
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Ultimately fret ends up joining the company and

319
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Working with Fred

320
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Wow so so at what point did you realize that

321
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
You know you want to be more than two

322
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
The passive investor

323
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
You want to be involved in the

324
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
There wasn't really any one moment in time it was more

325
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
We were also running an incubator at the time and Zappos ended up

326
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Moving in and

327
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
On the same building and so we just started

328
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Being able to help them or in

329
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
It just slowly

330
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Just evolve but it it was gradual thing it wasn't like

331
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
One day

332
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Wasn't really helping

333
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Next day it was

334
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,375
Like a time when people are still kind of freaked out about using credit cards online right so

335
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,727
In in the first year of that company where you actually selling shoes

336
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
So in order to test out

337
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
Food whole

338
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Concept for real

339
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,711
Nick would actually just goes down to the local shoe store

340
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,343
Take pictures of all the shoes that were on the wall and then put it on the website and if someone bought something then

341
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Local shoe store by the shoe and then and ship it

342
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Obviously

343
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Not making money from each of those but it was really

344
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
A really cheap and easy way to

345
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Test the actual demand

346
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
So that's how you would get

347
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
User gauge what people are interested in

348
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
Your mom finally just whether they buy shoes online at all

349
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Dad and then over time we've learned what brands they were interested in and then he

350
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
Eventually got to the point where

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
We wanted to make money and so burning through cash

352
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
Oedipus point of how how are you finding the I mean

353
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
So after the link exchange cell

354
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Set the money aside

355
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
For investing and also bought a bunch of

356
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Apartments or Lofts that were in that same building

357
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
AAA in San Francisco

358
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Yeah this is right in San Francisco

359
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
And I'm basically

360
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
As Zappos

361
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Growing

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,783
It was also losing my money and we also need more money for inventory and so

363
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
I ended up one by one selling off the apartments in

364
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
It's kind of like when in Monopoly when you you buy hotel or houses and then you have to sell them lose money

365
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
That's basically what would happen

366
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
So how many permits do you have to sell

367
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,263
All of them eventually really believe this thing was going to work

368
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,103
Yeah well so all this was happening at a bad time in terms of

369
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,711
The.com crash back in 2000 so is pretty much impossible to

370
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
Raise money from anyone

371
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
And there was also

372
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
911

373
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Warfarin

374
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Basically it was just

375
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
A bad

376
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
Economic environment and Israelis

377
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Could not get

378
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
As investment

379
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
No and and also there

380
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Huge companies like

381
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
X.com Noriko Merced

382
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
We're contemplating at the time and so

383
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Even if

384
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,871
Someone wanted to invest in an internet company the last thing they wanted to do was invested in

385
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Online shoe company

386
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
No one would ever buy shoes online

387
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
When we come back in a moment

388
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
The secret sauce that helped Zappos blow up

389
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
And hence

390
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
It had nothing to do

391
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Which

392
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167

Let's build with a

430
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
NPR

431
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
It's how I built this

432
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
From NPR

433
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Gyros

434
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
It's the early 2000s

435
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
And Zappos is struggling

436
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
The economy isn't doing well and

437
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
Basically at this time

438
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Tony hsieh is

439
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
Funding the company with his own money he's doing that

440
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
By selling up a bunch of apartments that he owns

441
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
This was not a good time for the company

442
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
I mean every week or two we had to make the choice between do we make payroll or do we pay half of our friend

443
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Or

444
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
Do we sell another apartment but

445
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,807
You can't just have an apartment overnight either City to actually have to lay people off

446
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
It is early days

447
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
First a couple years just the reality of

448
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,559
Really are out of cash and we're out of options and so had to do

449
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
They have to keep the company going

450
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
Even begin to turn around and how did you get to a place where you were

451
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Able to make it sustainable

452
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,711
I think for us a dick turning point was really deciding we wanted to build our brand to be about

453
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
The very best customer service in

454
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
Customer experience that wasn't baked into the model from the beginning that they came later

455
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
Ganso in the beginning we

456
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Just wanted to offer good service but

457
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
It wasn't until we decided we wanted to build

458
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
That's what we actually wanted or Grant the

459
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
To be about that

460
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Most important thing

461
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
It led

462
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
Us to do a lot of things that would not have made

463
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Resent

464
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
That wasn't our North Star and so

465
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Examples would be

466
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Offering free shipping both ways

467
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Cuz

468
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Obscene

469
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
Very expensive to do and

470
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,599
We were just around trying to say maximize the

471
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Profit margins

472
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,463
Then we've never would have gone down that path

473
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,047
And yes we would have made more money in the short-term during

474
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
Those days but then we wouldn't have

475
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Dope brand and reputation and so on and so

476
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
I think

477
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,567
When you actually want your brand to stand for something or just have some sort of purpose

478
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Anarchist

479
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,663
It's about to be about the very best customer service and customer experience

480
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
You do things that

481
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Kind of nonsensical

482
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
In some ways that your competition would

483
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Yes it's

484
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
There was a point where you really

485
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Justifying yourself like

486
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
This is your this is what

487
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Sister company of her

488
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Canton and there's actually a phrase that

489
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
I think

490
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
Poison our call center Ashley again came up with

491
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
Started describing us as

492
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Where Service Company matches

493
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
Happens to sell shoes

494
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
And so for us

495
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Is that

496
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,967
Welding 10-20 years around people don't even realize we started selling shoes online and

497
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
Imagine one day there could be a Zappos

498
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
Airlines Rose apus hotel that

499
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Is really just about

500
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Very best

501
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
My service

502
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Customer experience use apple cable

503
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
TV

504
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,559
Have a great I need that we are open to anything where

505
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
Service via differential

506
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,983
Jesus Zappos becomes a huge deal

507
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
And then like

508
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
At your Peak

509
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
It was I guess in

510
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
2009 you sell to Amazon why

511
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
Actually approached us several years

512
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
The forest

513
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
2009

514
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
They just wanted to

515
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,903
Clarus and and I'm basically becoming being acquired ends up joining

516
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
The mothership band

517
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Beacon elicits

518
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
Original identity and so

519
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
We said

520
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
No

521
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Very quickly

522
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
And then they actually

523
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
In the ears

524
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Between then in 2009

525
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
They launched a competitor called endless

526
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
And it was basically

527
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Lunch tomorrow

528
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Compete with us in ultimately

529
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
They weren't going to

530
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Able to class then they

531
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
What's essentially

532
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
Compete On Em and when

533
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
And so

534
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
They try that for a while but

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
We continue to grow

536
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
And so

537
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
I think after several years of

538
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm assuming I don't know what the details are

539
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Losing lots of money trying to

540
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
Gain market share through endless

541
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
They are precious again and said

542
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Okay we

543
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
Well let you guys be your own separate

544
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Subsidiary with your own separate culture in

545
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Don't separate way of doing business in

546
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Happy to report

547
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
7 years later they free Maine

548
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
Totally true their word and

549
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
We've been able to continue

550
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Doing

551
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Our own thing in our cultures

552
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
Very different and distinct from

553
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Amazon.cin

554
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
And so from our point of view is really

555
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,352
Just asked if we swapped out our prior board of directors with

556
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,960
A new one

557
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
You are so young

558
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
I need to eat you still in your early 40s

559
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Anytime so much

560
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
So where do you see yourself in life

561
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
20 or 30 years from now

562
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
Are you still running Zappos are you

563
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Are you doing something else

564
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
I know cuz if you ask me

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
20 years ago

566
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
Apus wasn't around but I would imagine

567
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
This

568
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
So

569
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
I don't know I mean I generally don't

570
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Try to think that far ahead

571
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
I think it's for me it's just making sure that

572
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
I'm doing what makes

573
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Me happy

574
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
So many people are

575
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Unhappy

576
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Weather

577
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Jobs

578
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Yeah for

579
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Various reasons

580
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Do I get sound

581
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
The culture

582
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Lack of autonomy

583
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,952
All those things are things that we wanted to

584
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,512
Hopefully show that there's a different and better way of

585
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
Not just work but I just think it was a spy

586
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Anime

587
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,264
Little kids that show lifestyles of

588
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Rich and famous

589
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Yeah and like

590
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
You you became a very rich

591
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
A famous person

592
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Tonight

593
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Change the way you live your life

594
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
I mean right now I live in an Airstream which

595
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,856
Trailer like a hundred fifty square feet type of thing

596
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah

597
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,184
We've got dogs running around

598
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Kids running around mashup

599
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Two alpacas

600
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,376
I just love it cuz there's just so many

601
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Random

602
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,728
Amazing things that happened around the campfire now you just

603
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Go outside and I actually

604
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,080
Think of it as the world's largest living room

605
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
In

606
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
I guess for me I've always

607
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
Like I'm going to

608
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
Payforit

609
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Experiences but not really for things

610
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Just because

611
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Experiences

612
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
I think I realized

613
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
A while ago

614
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Make me happy in

615
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
It's funny cuz I was

616
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Weather this morning

617
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
I having coffee with a

618
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Friend of mine in their streaming

619
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
We were talking about

620
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
I think was a quiz or something where the question was

621
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
If you

622
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
If your house was on fire and you could only save one thing

623
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
I'm a house what would it be and how

624
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
Now that was beautifully good way of

625
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Getting to know someone

626
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
And

627
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
I was just looking around my

628
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Air streaming

629
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
IPhone Maybe

630
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
And

631
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
People ask me what

632
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
My definition of success success is in

633
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
I would say

634
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
For me it's

635
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
Getting to the point where you're truly okay with losing everything you have

636
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,592
Tony hsieh still runs Zappos

637
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
Is he fights his introversion is by forcing himself to do something uncomfortable every single day

638
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
And the day we spoke with him he decided to dye his hair red and Spike it up into a mohawk

639
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
And please don't turn us off just yet in a moment

640
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
We're going to hear from you about the things

641
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
You guys are built

642
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
The first

643
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152

So we have

653
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Finally arrived to the very end of the show

654
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Time now to hear another story about something

655
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Your building

656
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,312
We've got a story from Dave weiner who lives in New York City

657
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,712
When you tell people that you're leaving your successful software career to start a bike company you get two types of reactions

658
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,040
If you get wow that's amazing let me hear more

659
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
And then you get the

660
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,368
Oh okay go to lock

661
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
About three years ago Dave was willing to take that leap

662
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Because

663
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Jesse loves bicycle

664
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,584
He basically grew up fixing them building them

665
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Times when he wanted to go out for a ride

666
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
With Friends

667
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,728
Heat run into this they always say

668
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
My bike has flat tires and needs a

669
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
The tune up

670
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
And then of course me is the X mechanic

671
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
I either have to go over early and

672
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Tune up your bike

673
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Wouldn't go for a ride

674
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
So they decided to design the

675
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Kind of bike wear

676
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
That type of thing

677
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Would not happen

678
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:11,744
We really reinvented the bicycle going through every little not Bolt

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Pisco

680
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Hornet on the bike

681
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
With the focus of Romania

682
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
Enzo in a basement Workshop in Manhattan

683
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Dave designed his first

684
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Bike made of aluminum

685
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
And stainless steel with

686
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Internal gears and disc brakes

687
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
What he says what really said his bike apart is that

688
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Instead of a greasy chain

689
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,784
It's got a belt drive made from carbon fiber that

690
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Feels more like rubber

691
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
So there's no grease

692
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
There's nothing to rust

693
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,232
There's no way to suck in your pants and leave you on the side of the road

694
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
And it lasts three times longer than a tree

695
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
Now you might think a bike like this would cost like

696
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,144
Thousands of dollars but

697
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,472
They figured out a way to do it for a lot cheaper more like

698
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
$400

699
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,872
And his concept was so popular that he raised half a million bucks on Kickstarter

700
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,688
And then found two factories in Asia to make the bikes

701
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,552
But about two years ago when it was time to deliver the first thousand bikes

702
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
He got into a jam

703
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
We had our our bikes produced

704
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
And they were on the water on their way over from Taiwan

705
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
When

706
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
Customs took our containers

707
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:22,144
And tell them for an undetermined amount of time while they inspected them and even worse

708
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
This was in December started to get emails from our customers saying you're going to ruin

709
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,384
I bought this for my spouse for my son for my daughter

710
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
For Christmas

711
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
It needs to be under the tree

712
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
In all this

713
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
Almost offended the whole company

714
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
But about a week before Christmas

715
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Customs finally let the bikes

716
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,464
Through I was lucky we made it on the very last day week

717
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,560
That's Dave weiner of priority bicycles which now offers 6

718
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Different kinds of bikes

719
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,448
And this spring they'll be opening their first retail showroom in New York City

720
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
Hate we love hearing stories over the things

721
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
