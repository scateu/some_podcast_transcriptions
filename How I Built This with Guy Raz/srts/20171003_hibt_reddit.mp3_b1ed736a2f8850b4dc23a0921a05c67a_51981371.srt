Inside you got to go back to just felt like

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
And I wasn't even kind of a CEO mentality is Marcus like an engineer who knew how it works

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Hand-washing is trolls run rampant on Reddit I'm just thinking I know how to fix this

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
To know the mind of a troll give me access to the code I can

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
Running PR how I built this entrepreneurs idealist

18
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Stories behind the movement

19
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Gyros not Today's Special live episode two College roommates built-in internet community

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,560
With a population bigger than Brazil

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Search where the

22
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
300 million active Reddit users

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
You probably think of it is this incredible place in a home where you can find your tribe groups of people talking about

24
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
But the weird stuff you're into

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
But if you are not interested

26
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
Can seem like this super intimidating Insider Club

27
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Hard to penetrate

28
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
If you land on the homepage in you're not familiar with it

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,400
I think you accidentally stumbled onto the internet Circa 2005

30
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Because that is what Reddit looks like

31
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
It's a discussion site filter

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Byerly with user-generated content

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
Which means depending on the time of day

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Anything from photos of

35
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,808
Cats wearing Renaissance Era costumes to Serious discussions about US foreign policy

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
In this simple little site

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
It's also worth it

38
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Enough money

39
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,768
Actually it's most recent valuation put it at 1.8

40
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Billion dollars

41
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,912
And all of this from an idea that Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian

42
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Came up with a road trip to Boston

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
During their senior year of college in 2005

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Reddit and the founders have been through a lot of ups and downs Reddit users

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,504
Nearly shut it down in 2015

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,136
A certain point parts of the site were hijacked by trolls who used it to spread hateful messages

47
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,024
Alexis and Steve went through a long. When they stop speaking

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,888
The recently read it started to hit its stride again be specific

49
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
200 million-dollar cash infusion from investors

50
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,824
With plans to make the site into a more user-friendly place

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
A couple weeks ago in San Francisco I sat down with Alexis and Steve in front of a live audience

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,368
I hear about how they came to invent what's become known as the front page of the internet

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Steve I just wanted to

54
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Begin by asking you

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Really important question which is

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
You are wearing a purple sweater with a dinosaur on which a robot

57
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Is riding the dinosaur

58
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
That's right and you talk a little about that your sweater with with pleasure thank you for asking

59
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes

60
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
So

61
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
The advice that you're often given is

62
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Dress

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Like the person you want to be

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
And so

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
I went to Google and I typed in

66
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Awesome

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Sweater

68
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
And

69
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Click on images

70
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
And I just scroll down until I found something that spoke to me

71
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
I'm not I'm not making this up and then

72
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
I found that

73
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Cool

74
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Create

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Now we can start the interview so how did you guys meet

76
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
Tell me the story that you remember

77
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
Sure as I recall

78
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
We

79
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,231
We we met first the first day of college at University of Virginia on our first day

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Wahoo

81
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Anna

82
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,167
It is so I right before Alexis and round simple and our rooms were across from each other

83
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
And everybody's

84
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
It erase rooms had their names on the door

85
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,871
And so mine said Steven David and across the hall where Alexis and Mike

86
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
And my first thought was

87
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
This is sweet their girls on our Hall

88
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
So needless to say

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
When I met Alexis my first emotion was disappointment

90
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
I was elated

91
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
Because he was playing PlayStation 2

92
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
So I was happy to meet you

93
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
We got over the fact

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
I was not what he expected

95
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
And became fast friends and like super close friends

96
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,359
Yeah yeah we can park gaming rigs

97
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Play a lot of video games together

98
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
And live together

99
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
4 years 8 years in college shared many experiences and college together

100
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
I will not go into detail

101
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
And I am your best friend

102
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
And what would you say

103
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
I was history and business major

104
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
So nothing to do with s humanities

105
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
Nothing to do with technology at all

106
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,519
No I mean I took classes in high school and I fancied myself a programmer until I met

107
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Steve and realized

108
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
I was not going to be a programmer for letting you were a computer science major exactly and so I had always drawn up wanting to be Abyss

109
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Business major

110
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Until I met Alexis

111
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
And I decided that engineering is the path for me

112
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
So when you guys were at

113
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
Yuan College were you

114
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
I mean were you talking about business starting a business

115
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Doing something together was that

116
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Something you would talk about and doing your video game sessions

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Eventually

118
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
Jose the first

119
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Three years were really

120
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Just video game

121
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
And I act

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,111
It was it was hard last year sometime around that I don't remember the first conversation we were we were in

123
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
When's the hockey game in DC but I don't know when that was last year was Junior cuz I as history major I thought

124
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
The only way I was going to

125
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Have a career

126
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
Was to go to law school

127
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,471
And I obsessed I spend all my time the library obsessing over my grade studying for the LSAT

128
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
And then on a Saturday morning

129
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Walked out of an LSAT

130
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
To go

131
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
And I went to Waffle House

132
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
It's a great place for epiphanies and Waffles

133
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
And I had both there that morning

134
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
And realized if I wanted these waffles more than the LSAT

135
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
I probably shouldn't be a lawyer

136
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
And and they needed something to do with my life and so naturally I went to

137
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,071
My smartest friend and said hey Steve you always have these great ideas

138
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
For Technologies like let's try to make a business

139
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
And did you have an idea

140
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,983
I did have an idea another business unique to the

141
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Mid-Atlantic

142
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Sheetz gas station

143
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
And

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Sheets had at the time

145
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
If you can get subs

146
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
Sub sub sandwiches his wife where else would you want a sub sandwich

147
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Plush

148
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,095
Electric POS

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
So you got an order from tusk

150
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
Gas thinking

151
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,103
Does an electronic ordering system inside I can just convey my order to that machine

152
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
The fella inside could be making my sandwich

153
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
And that I would have to

154
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Weights

155
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
And it's so that was the idea for

156
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
My mobile menu

157
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Did this would have been like

158
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,255
A pre-op cuz it's pretty iPhones it would have been like on a Blackberry or a cell phone or something or

159
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,351
Yeah this is what we learned later that yeah yeah

160
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Was actually ahead of its time

161
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,239
The

162
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Cell phones

163
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
IPhone Xs

164
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
The cell phones

165
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Didn't have apps

166
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
We agree name though

167
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
My mobile menu

168
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:56,319
Alfie Deyes

169
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,415
You can make that little logo for that too

170
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
What is 3 oz

171
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
So did you guys

172
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
How did you decide to

173
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Pitch this idea

174
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Not very effective

175
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
We had this fantasy of

176
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
I would work for my

177
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,991
The job I work for a startup all through college

178
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
Button in Virginia

179
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
During that time we can call and startups we call them small businesses

180
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
And

181
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
If I work for the small business office school and I had a job offer

182
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Continue on after I graduated

183
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
The plan was I would work

184
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
There during the day

185
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
And then Alexis and I would work on

186
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
My mobile menu in the east

187
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
And we

188
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
I considered

189
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Like asking my parents for funding

190
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
But we'd actually didn't even know how to do that

191
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
So

192
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
We did

193
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
But then we had a life-changing spring break

194
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,671
Yes it's so this is spring break of senior year what was life changing what happened to Cancun

195
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
How are the only kids in Virginia who didn't

00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Because Katie

00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815

00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511

Sao Paulo

216
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
Which at the time is really he just stands there and

217
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
Stares into his paper and reads an essay

218
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Nevertheless

219
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
At the end of The Talk

220
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015

227
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
And I would totally be worth the cost of buying you a drink

228
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,823
To get you to come out with us we came all the way from Virginia and we have a startup we want to hit you

229
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Because

230
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
You boys came all the way from Virginia

231
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
I do shock we had trains

232
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,063

233
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367

I hope you still there

236
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,047
In Harvard Square

237
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
We have a plant you pitched him

238
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
My mobile menu

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,959
And what

240
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
And what was his response

241
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
He he said

242
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
This will be the end of line

243
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
And I was like

244
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
No apologies I don't understand

245
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,855
What I want to do is get my sub when I'm pumping gas

246
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And he went off he was so hyped

247
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
And we left there feeling

248
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Amazing

249
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
Cuz this was like one of your Idols who said that we actually had a really good idea

250
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
So

251
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
We got back to Virginia

252
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
And a couple days later Alexis

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
That's me hey Steve you should send Paul an email

254
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Thinking

255
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Him for meeting us

256
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
And so so I did

257
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
He responded back those two guys

258
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Virginia

259
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
I just

260
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Announce this new program called y combinator

261
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Where to invest in

262
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
People like you

263
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
You should apply

264
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
So we did

265
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
And you're thinking we've got a sure bet because

266
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
She already told us it's going to revolutionize lines

267
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
And we give you interview of Our Lives

268
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Yeah although there was a

269
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
A moment's where

270
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
I was explaining to Robert Morris

271
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
One of the probably best

272
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Engineers programmers on Earth

273
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
I would have web server

274
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
He already knew

275
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Upon myself to

276
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Really tied up

277
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
We nailed it we nailed it

278
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,631
And then they said they're going to call us later that night you guys are high-fiving each other and your

279
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
Ready for the call I got the call and I picked up

280
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Hello

281
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Anytime sorry

282
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
We're rejecting you

283
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
And and I really sucked

284
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
That really sucks we were going to prove them wrong now

285
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
We went out drinking and we were going to prove them wrong

286
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
So you went out drinking you were like

287
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Dowsers guys

288
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
Make this thing anyway

289
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,743
And then the next morning on the way back

290
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
He called

291
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Paul Graham called

292
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Play cool

293
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Hello

294
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Has Paul and he's like

295
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
You still don't like your idea why would you call to say that

296
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
You be like you too

297
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Did you change your idea

298
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Will invest

299
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
I got to go to play cool

300
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
I will think about it will get back to you

301
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
And I think at that point we were already convinced

302
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
We need to get off this train. Offer that in that moment my bubble menu side

303
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
So quickly

304
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
And we got right back

305
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
The next train going north when we're back side that was Paul

306
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,367
Paul and what what do you start doing you started like brainstorming with him

307
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Basically yes

308
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
And so we are talking about

309
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Like things we could build

310
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
There's a couple of websites that we both like that's time

311
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
One of which was delicious

312
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
And so delicious

313
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
It was a social bookmarking website

314
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
And there's a

315
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Patient

316
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Popular

317
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,383
And intuition / popular you could see things that were being bookmark

318
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
That day that were popular

319
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
And thinks that were being bookmark more often would hang around a little while

320
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
The thing is when you bookmark something it's because you can't

321
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Finish in one sitting

322
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
So it's reference material

323
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,279
Things you can't get through things want to come back to later so delicious

324
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
Popular was basically this really

325
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Cool

326
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,447
Index of the most boring content on the internet

327
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
On any given day

328
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
And so

329
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Slashdot news for nerds stuff that matters

330
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Still online

331
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
And Slash.

332
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Had this incredible community

333
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
Yeah you go there for news everyday but really the magic / that live in

334
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
And so the idea was can we take the

335
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Mechanics of delicious

336
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
User submitted and

337
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
And kind of Pop Billboard Top 40 effect

338
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
And combine it with good content in a good community

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
And that was the

340
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Genesis of red

341
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
And

342
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
This was

343
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
A chance

344
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Basically get $12,000 from an investor we really trusted

345
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
To just try something after 3 months

346
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
And at worst case

347
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
You know what the other summer may we just would have

348
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
I don't know come back to Virginia

349
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Did you come up with

350
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
Fully formed idea Band by talking with Paul because

351
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Going from my mobile menu

352
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
2

353
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
What became Reddit is a radical change me did you

354
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Come up with that concept

355
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,375
Don't you went back at the Boston start brainstorming and that came out of this

356
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
I have that note

357
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
It's it's in my desk at work

358
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
The notes I took during that first meeting

359
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
And

360
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
I'd actually written down in that notebook

361
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Front page of the internet

362
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
That's what we are going to build

363
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,527
Gigi is terrible in naming companies but when he nailed it with that phrase

364
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,879
It was he said to you you want to make music

365
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
We said okay and so we did

366
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,679
Nothing right like he was this big concept that we've sort of agreed to work on over the span of an hour and

367
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
It was 12 Grand to just spend three months working on it

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Just be clear you meet

369
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Hall on spring break

370
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
F2005 so roughly March

371
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
Maybe early April of 2005

372
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
Reddit in June

373
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Of 2005

374
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
We actually only worked on it for about 3 weeks

375
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
Before we lost it

376
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
I didn't write the first line of code until June

377
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
And I had never built the website

378
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
10

379
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
We were kind of Paul special projects

380
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
Little bit of how we got into YC

381
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Email

382
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
What does ideas and

383
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
You know things like

384
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
I think it's two

385
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Best piece of advice or

386
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
Your name is awful you need to get rid of that little bug

387
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
I still have that email that one in the book

388
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
I really think small

389
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Yeah she had a lot of

390
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Really good ideas have that there that you want its name it Reddit

391
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Alexis wanted to limit Reddit

392
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Great thank you

393
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,935
You like more than

394
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:21,823
We couldn't afford snoo which was the name we wanted which was the idea was

395
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Keyboard ask

396
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Oh what's new

397
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,223
We say exactly it's what's new online

398
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
And Sons that Alexis was like they'll say

399
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,647
What's Reddit I hope I hope people would say I read it on Reddit

400
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,487
Unfortunately, cost $4,000 which we didn't have

401
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Third of our fun

402
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Could afford it

403
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,191
Name the mascots new instead and it was available please free so Reddit

404
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
That the mascot where my Mikey contributions

405
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
How my LinkedIn profile

406
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
Sew-in in that are in that sort of

407
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
Does beginning the beginning

408
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,319
Pierre time see if you were coding you are doing that

409
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
That certain type

410
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
Exide

411
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
What and what were you doing are you handling this

412
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Only non-technical founder

413
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,007
And it was a very curious thing for all involved aside from naming the company and drawing the mascot

414
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
I have the important responsibility of everything else that wasn't technical

415
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
From like ordering the pizza

416
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,991
To keeping the spreadsheet with all the receipts

417
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Do I'm haggling cell phone bills down

418
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
And

419
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,647
If you have to be an eagle this job as a

420
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
The founder because

421
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
You just have to get this done

422
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Because anytime

423
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
Anytime Stephen if I'm an engineer would spend doing something that's not

424
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Michael is a waste of time

425
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
And

426
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
I like to think

427
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Over the years

428
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Prove my worth

429
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
I'll be back there in that was a very common question

430
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,895
Ivory, question

431
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
People to post stuff

432
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
At the beginning

433
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
Funny you ask that

434
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
Time we cheated

435
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
So we had

436
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
A special version of the submit

437
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
So for most users

438
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Of which there is none

439
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
They would see

440
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Title and URL

441
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Is there a little

442
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,199
Arthrolysis and I was title URL and username

443
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
So you

444
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,855
Put in the link you wanted to submit and you make up username and hit submit and it would register that username if it did exist

445
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm Horsham it as a username if it did

446
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
And that's why the first

447
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Hundred

448
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Or so

449
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Reddit users were

450
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Either

451
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Characters from World of Warcraft

452
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Or

453
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
Pieces of furniture in our living room

454
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
Not very creative

455
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Book at level 60 that summer though

456
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
What's the level cap in Warcraft

457
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
So how did you get the word out how did you actually get real users

458
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Well so Paul did that for us

459
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
He

460
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,416
Was like hey you guys into launching into launching his lawn smells like okay we're almost ready to Launch

461
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
And then he wrote an essay

462
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Where he's linked to rett

463
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Without telling us

464
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
I had my my

465
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
My computer

466
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Emmett Idaho screen extra record see the error log

467
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
Of of things by buying all the sudden one day

468
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
It's just really fast

469
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Sounds like what

470
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Is going on

471
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
And

472
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
What happened espalda

473
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Launch.

474
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
And

475
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
So

476
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
That's just me how it happened so our first real users were actually

477
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Program fans

478
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
People reading

479
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
And I kind of set the tone

480
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
For the

481
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Early days of Reddit

482
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
You have to be Scrappy cuz I know five there was no social network

483
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Speak of them Facebook existed but it wasn't

484
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,264
Your college at work and we dat we emailed every one of our friends remember two of them Morgan and Connor

485
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
Thank you actually signed up and started using it

486
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
But most people just didn't care and you just

487
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,992
Beg try to beg bloggers to write about you

488
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
And I'll never forget though a changing way was the name of some random person's blog and it was the first random person

489
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
Whoever took the time to write about

490
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Reddit

491
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,048
And I found this post years later I mean it took a little work at the Wayback machine

492
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
And if you look some random

493
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
IPad block

494
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Ranch

495
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
I'm the first two comments are from you and me

496
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Remember this

497
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
What we actually look like

498
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,640
Thank you so much this is so great if you need anything let us know where the co-founders

499
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,760
And it's an especially in 05 it was a really isolating experience to put something out in the world

500
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
And and feel like no one

501
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Care

502
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,928
It's the first time someone cared felt amazing that's how I found this guy's website

503
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
A decade later

504
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
I was cuz there was enough of it still stored in my brain to someone

505
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
Kerrigan we reached out and thank them

506
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
This is old school just

507
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Giving a damn

508
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,984
Try to get anyone to write about us or talk about us

509
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
At all did you have a like

510
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,736
A business model in your mind I mean

511
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
You $12,000 so

512
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
Like did you think well will eventually get advertising

513
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
It was

514
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Web advertising wasn't

515
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
What it is today. Existed

516
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
It was not a priority for us

517
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Just have ads

518
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
It's better I think of how you were going to make it

519
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Sustainable

520
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Not really

521
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
We weren't really thinking in those terms

522
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Be honest

523
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
Because of the way we got into YC

524
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
We

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Barely I didn't even really think of ourselves as a business

526
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
This is more of an adventure

527
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
We didn't have

528
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,832
A Target destination of Northstar admission we're building towards

529
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
It was

530
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,208
How do we notify everyday without looking stupid in front of Paul Graham

531
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
And then once we get in August

532
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
A few months and what's good real users

533
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
It became was just not with the user

534
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
And that was our mentality for actually quite a while

535
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,288
After Paul Graham wrote that essay

536
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
And link to Reddit who's that is at the moment where it took off

537
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
No no that was the moment when we started getting

538
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Real traffic

539
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
I was in August is when we started getting real user

540
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
I remember that day

541
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
We used to Alexis nursing all the content we had a rule back then

542
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
I'm fat

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
All of the

544
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,096
Content on the front page had to be less than 24 hours

545
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
The front pages 25 links lawn

546
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
So if there are fewer than 25 links submitted that day

547
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
There be fewer than 25 likes on the front page

548
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Independent air quality

549
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
And

550
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,480
It's a sometimes we go to site there be like 7 links there and then we'll just be white

551
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Inside taking a day off for whatever reason

552
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
Late afternoon

553
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Shoot I haven't thought about it all day

554
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
I bet the front pages completely dried off is completely blank

555
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
And when I when I checked

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
Pussy full of c**

557
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
From usernames that I never seen before

558
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
That was the day when

559
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
We realize that this is a thing

560
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
These are real users were not just propping it up with her

561
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Fake accounts

562
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,968
That was a really special day I spoke it really kind of excited when I think about it

563
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Because

564
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
That's what I motivation changed

565
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,416
And that's when I was really bored I think

566
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
That summer that you guys launched in 2005

567
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Alexa

568
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
What's your

569
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Your life

570
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Went off the rails

571
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Tickle summer for you what was going on

572
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,080
Well it's 2 months after we launched

573
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,640
My girlfriend had a pretty serious accident

574
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Falling out of us

575
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
5 story window in Germany

576
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
I'm really loud

577
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
She's been about

578
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
For 5 months

579
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Tacoma

580
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
And and

581
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Finally thanks

582
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Came out of it

583
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
I'm going back to the States

584
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
December that year and actually

585
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
Has made in year

586
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Full recovery

587
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Switch remarkable

588
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
But it was a hard

589
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
That was

590
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
That was hard

591
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Say the least

592
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
And a month later

593
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
My mother was diagnosed with

594
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Terminal brain cancer

595
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
And so

596
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
Can you go from feeling invulnerable at

597
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Wanting you you want

598
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
22

599
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
And startling

600
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Munson's

601
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Starting a business

602
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Feeling like you

603
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Take over the world

604
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
And then being really hit in the stomach

605
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
And realizing

606
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,352
No no no that's real life and I knew at some point I had an amazing life

607
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,704
I've been that point very very lucky and I knew at some point the comeuppance was going to come

608
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
And

609
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
I'll never forget that the first meeting I had back

610
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
With my mom

611
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
The first words out of her mouth

612
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
Or I'm sorry

613
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
She felt so bad because

614
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,416
I'm that is the kind of woman she was that she was always thinking of of me

615
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Of other people ahead of herself

616
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
And

617
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
That

618
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
In a lot of ways came to find my entire experience at right it's till this day is imbued in what Reddit mean

619
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Seems to me

620
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
Because it is the best of her

621
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
I know that

622
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Cuz

623
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,944
Of everything she gave me in confidence and motivation

624
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
And support an unflinching love that I could never fail the redis could never

625
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
Really fail because she released me of any of that concern and so I can start up sucks.

626
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Socks

627
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
But it ain't that bad

628
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
Compared to what you do if you're going through chemotherapy or you're like my father supporting some

629
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Who is

630
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
And it was

631
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
And I'll get that I'm still grateful for because it keeps perspective on every trauma everything that I say

632
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Face

633
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Because nothing's really actually that bad when we come back

634
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
Why Alexis and Steve decided to sell Reddit and how it took a toll on their friendship state

635
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864

Hey welcome back to this LIVE edition that's how I built this

643
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Recorded in San Francisco

644
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104
So it's 2005 and read it has just launched and the site is growing really fast

645
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Until around this time

646
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,456
What are the founding partners of Y combinator

647
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Jessica Livingston

648
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,624
Suggested that Alexis go to New York to help spread the word about Reddit

649
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
And one of the meetings on that visit

650
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Buddha life changing

651
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
You said just go down there

652
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Tell a couple people

653
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
That you're

654
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,656
In town on a press tour and see if they'll meet you for coffee

655
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Antichrist on a friend's sofa

656
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
And had meetings and one of the meetings was a freelance reporter

657
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
And I thought I was bitching her for a story but we actually kind of hit it off

658
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,736
And and shelter Lee was like you know what I don't feel like we should I want to write a story cuz like

659
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:19,136
Like I think we're friends like let's not make this a business thing like let's just stay in touch and be friends

660
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
Whatever like I'm just your on a press tour

661
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,304
And you know I got a lot of stuff going on so I got to go

662
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
And

663
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
I don't know if you weeks later I get an email from this guy named kurosh karimkhani who is the head of BD

664
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
At Conde Nast

665
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Digital art

666
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Kind of mask

667
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Explain to me that his wife

668
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
Who is an editor at wired

669
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:47,552
Had heard from one of her writers Rachel the one I meant about this company called Reddit

670
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
And he wanted to have a quick phone call

671
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,464
And during that call he basically pitched this idea of making a white label Reddit

672
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Lipstick

673
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
As like

674
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
Project and then have five months

675
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Slater

676
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
We're talkin about acquisition

677
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
I mean I think you glossed over

678
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:10,336
The five months where I was the head moderator of lipstick.com or an expert

679
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Expert at celebrity gossip

680
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
So

681
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
I mean it's it's pretty amazing I mean

682
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
A year-and-a-half

683
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
After you

684
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Start redis

685
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
You sell it

686
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
The Conde Nast

687
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
4

688
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
Somewhere between 10 and 20 million dollars

689
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
So presumably

690
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,056
Was that the reason were you guys like you are 22 23 and you were thinking cool we can like walk away with a couple million box

691
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Basically

692
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
Yeah I mean guy

693
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
This was 60 months of work

694
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,088
That was going to be more money for me than my entire family had made my mother and father had made their entire lives

695
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Like are you kidding me

696
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Remind me to GB

697
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Like

698
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Like this was not

699
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
This seems like a joke

700
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
The best phone call of my life was calling her up saying hey Mom it was worth it like all of that song

701
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Support all of that everything like

702
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
We did it

703
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
And and that I would never ever trade that phone call I will be the greatest phone call for the rest of my life

704
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,064
I regret from a business standpoint yes we sold it early but I have no regrets whatsoever

705
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,672
A decision because I got to make that phone call and she lives she lives

706
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
So

707
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
Once that happened you guys

708
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
Become employees of Conde Nast

709
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,872
9 not in 4 Times Square though

710
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
They didn't put us in the fancy cafeteria

711
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,528
So we yeah but that's where we work so I'm right there on the corner in that organic build

712
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
3

713
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,648
That was your commitment you had to stay there for three years and then you could

714
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
Do whatever whatever was he want

715
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
And we both

716
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Love's redis

717
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:12,448
Contracts ended Alexis but you know why I left

718
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Because

719
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,824
I wanted to start another company that was involved in the exchange of money

720
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
So that

721
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
I wouldn't have to contrive a business

722
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
Cuz I'm right at we are at still we hadn't quite figured out at

723
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
That's right we lose a stiff Eliquis

724
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
I didn't realize how

725
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
Cool right it was I thought

726
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
If you just build something

727
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
It'll just grow

728
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
That's how things go on the internet

729
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,072
And I didn't realize that right was so special about the Spy

730
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
The fact that we didn't know what we're doing and the spite

731
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
The fact that like

732
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
At times were very unproductive

733
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
It just grew

734
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,824
So when's that time ended you went and found it

735
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
A new company hipmunk

736
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Kim Alexis

737
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
What you motherland

738
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,784
You went to Armenia Armenian which is where your dad

739
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
For a couple months

740
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
And were you just thinking I'm done with

741
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
Techworld like I've finished

742
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Ish

743
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,864
I just wanted to unplug a bit and I felt really guilty because I had never been

744
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,264
And so I felt this tremendous guilt for not having this connection and and had an amazing experience there and could just kind of hit reset

745
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
And and then came back and I figured I was going to live in New York

746
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
For the rest of my days

747
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
How to draw mascot for hipmunk

748
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,248
Steve butter

749
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Briefly

750
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Yeah it is

751
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
Call access point

752
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,208
Alexis Night by 2009 had lived together for 8 years

753
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
From 2001 to 2009

754
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Nn

755
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
Remind me to buy time we left Reddit

756
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
We were not on the best of

757
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
We hadn't

758
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
So we've been through a lot together

759
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:56,640
And we've never really discussed it will never discuss the roles that right at front of the boundaries who is response

760
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
For what

761
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
We we didn't really have a

762
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
Resolving disputes

763
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
And

764
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
I wouldn't see a ton of each other

765
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Is it there

766
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
I was in a move to San Francisco

767
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,232
Ravenous old Alexa State on the East Coast

768
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Family for

769
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
A year-and-a-half

770
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
It's on a contract expired we just kind of said hey you know

771
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Great see you later

772
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Unless it was like

773
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Resolve tension

774
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,592
Let me look there was a lot that went on during that. For sure

775
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
But we never really exercise the muscles

776
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
That Founders have to exercise that best friends don't and there are lots of found

777
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
It's great to be able to start a company with one of your best friends

778
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
The conversations you have to have as co-founders are very different as friends and we didn't have enough for

779
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:54,752
The hard ones often enough and it was just unresolved and faster like I don't think it was I didn't feel animosity

780
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
No I think it was like neglect

781
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,296
And you threw yourself into activism at that

782
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
Yeah I don't want to see their not get messed up

783
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
I like spending time on it I have a career because of it

784
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Right place at the right time

785
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Sopa and pipa

786
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Nettleton have a job

787
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
That was really helpful

788
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
Yeah can you talking about what that was about a newer Super Active in the sopa campaign

789
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
Net neutrality in

790
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
What what what was allowed

791
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,200
Well-intentioned people admit most of them are well-intentioned in DC

792
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
Writing bills for technology they don't really understand

793
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,368
Without people around them who are themselves technologist often lead to things like soap and pepper

794
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
And those were two bills that were

795
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
Design to stop

796
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Copyright infringement

797
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
That would have him practice

798
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Basically broken the internet

799
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
One of the house building was

800
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Why was the Senate bill

801
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
I was

802
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,496
Was it one of the best ways to ever get first exposed to DC because they

803
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Told us all that it was going to be

804
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Inevitable

805
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
When we

806
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Got involved

807
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
And then maybe 5 or 6 months later

808
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Because of Americans

809
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,712
The phone and calling in the internet

810
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Working out

811
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
They were on think

812
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Legislators were running from these bills

813
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,672
And it was a great demonstration of the power of people to actually affect

814
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
Change DC which I didn't think was a

815
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
The thing I didn't like

816
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
That's what you dream of

817
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Is how DC works and

818
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
I found a way out

819
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
And during the time U-verse

820
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
Mulan it Hitman

821
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Trying to get that company

822
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah I mean I mean

823
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Starting any business hipmunk

824
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,920
All of my hoes travel

825
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
His travel

826
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,272
Yes yes we were in the Glamorous business of slinging

827
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,320
Plane tickets and hotel reservations

828
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Fun

829
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
I will take a lot of pride in the work we were doing and we built I thought of very

830
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Nice product

831
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
I mean we always really enjoyed saving people time

832
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
Travel is very

833
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Throat and we didn't

834
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
We didn't realize that going

835
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
That would be so that's like a lot of our attention and

836
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
And stress

837
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Sterno Sears

838
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
And you guys were just done with thread

839
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,616
That you are not involved

840
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,968
At that point at all eventually read it was still wholly owned by

841
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
This point

842
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
But I was involved as a

843
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
But not in the day

844
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
How's my day today connection died

845
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
When we when we left there at 6

846
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Me Alexis Chris

847
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
David

848
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Jeremy and Mike

849
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
And I

850
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,168
Chris and David came with me to Pitman

851
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Eventually

852
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
And I was my last connection to redis

853
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Really

854
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,312
Until there was a time when I was at hit my quirk

855
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
I knew 0% of the people who worked at Reddit

856
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
That's a little weird

857
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Didn't feel

858
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
Painful

859
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
In July of 2015

860
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Francesca

861
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Nuts

862
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
Moderator start to

863
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,816
Shut down

864
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Subreddits

865
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
What was going on

866
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
What were you were at hipmunk United Reddit

867
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Did you like

868
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
Check out red and start to notice

869
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,152
Read it like a couple things are happening over the course of 2,000

870
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
I'm ready

871
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
I just raced 50 million.

872
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
I'm going to see you all the time you Sean

873
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Misguided midlife crisis

874
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Unless the rough

875
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
I'm so Alan Powell

876
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Took over

877
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,744
And read it went through a series of crises

878
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
That year

879
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,584
Mostly content-related on the site that

880
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Toxic users

881
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Had

882
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Kai gotten out of control

883
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,312
And it's one thing after another and right as getting killed in a press and everybody just feeling like

884
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
What's going on

885
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
And at the same time

886
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Alexis and I were

887
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Kind of repairing

888
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't I don't remember exactly how it started enough my point of view I just had this thought of like Hey where's my best

889
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,464
Around that time you said I want to February

890
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
2015-2016

891
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
You know what and what you decided that you were just going to reach out

892
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Basically

893
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
I think we have dinner

894
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
And

895
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
We started this process of

896
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Flags

897
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
2.5 years since we left

898
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,968
And we just started kind of talking through things

899
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
We agreed I'm over that first dinner that he wouldn't put some effort

900
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
Just repairing our friendship

901
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
We actually

902
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Saw

903
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
My therapist

904
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Saw him together

905
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,328
The two of you went to therapy together

906
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,632
When

907
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,472
Wednesday fishing out of he was like look my therapist is really good idea

908
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Let's come together

909
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
And

910
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Picture

911
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
So

912
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,664
We will actively kind of working on things until we are in

913
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Closer Closer contact

914
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,296
And then things that are really starting to go

915
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Yeah

916
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
And they reached the boiling point

917
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
In July of 2000

918
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
They took the moderates who control their communities

919
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
All communities on Reddit

920
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,840
You know that many thousands of them are created by users and run by you

921
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Moderators

922
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
And

923
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
They were upset

924
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,264
Y'all for a sound like you tissues and also just like

925
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Just general frustration

926
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Until they took their communities.

927
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
And is effectively turned right at all

928
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
For a couple of days

929
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Alexis and I were talking about this

930
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
Alexis who it was close to the right of the time on the board

931
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
Apps like what you got to get the site online

932
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Like this whatever you got to do

933
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,208
Like you just got to like broker a peace

934
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
To get us back online because

935
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
We were

936
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Very fortunate that

937
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Our

938
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,656
Largest competitor for years dig

939
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
Made a blunder

940
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,264
A few years prior and basically commit suicide

941
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
The front of the whole internet thing was 5 times bigger than us

942
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
Release the new version of their software that was so

943
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,503
This life I user something just came to read

944
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,599
And inside this stuff that that could happen was a very real

945
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Fear of

946
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
And at the same time

947
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
Every single person I know

948
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Texted me

949
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Inside

950
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
You got to go back to

951
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
Then and that's kind of what got the ball rolling

952
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,775
All happen against the backdrop of Ellen Powell

953
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Resignation she

954
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:28,479
Was very public about the abuse that was heaped on her she wrote an op-ed in Washington Post basically sing the trolls

955
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
1

956
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,087
Around the time the Southern Poverty Law Center releases this

957
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,903
Port that says some of the most virulent and violent

958
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Popaganda

959
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
Describe racism misogynist anti-semites

960
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
And you

961
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Go

962
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Back to this

963
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,935
Yeah my friends ghost

964
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
I made the decision to go back at my buddies

965
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
30th birthday

966
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
And you also do decide to go back

967
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,151
Yeah we both came back full time then but like

968
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,503
Getting Steve installed as CEO with something that

969
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
Really only one person in the planet could do

970
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
And it was Steve never my friends are like why do you run into that burning building

971
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,815
And it just felt like it's time I had no choice

972
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,983
I like really really loves Reddit and part of me it wasn't even kind of a CEO mentality is more like an engineer

973
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
Who knew how that works

974
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,103
And watching these trolls run rampant on Reddit

975
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
I know how to fix

976
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
I to know the mind of a troll

977
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,831
Give me access to the code I can

978
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Exodus

979
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
And that was

980
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
Kind of those kind of my feeling and I know we can do this

981
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
Am I don't want to see Reddit

982
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
Now taken over by these people is it is it possible to

983
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Bully

984
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Get me to remove

985
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
The racist misogynist

986
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
You know

987
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
Horrible horribly

988
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
Cruel people meaning

989
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Can you do that

990
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Bullock

991
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
Anything is Possible

992
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
But that's not the goal

993
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,927
What we want Reddit to be is

994
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,975
In many ways over a reflection

995
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
Of humanity

996
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Humanity is not perfect

997
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
But what you get on Reddit

998
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
Is an authentic representation of what's going on in the

999
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
And we believe that is

1000
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
Very very powerful

1001
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,055
And the good news is it what one of the things I read it as taught me

1002
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Is that people are fundamentally good

1003
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,967
People in large numbers want to help each other when you put people together night contacts

1004
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
They will do really incredible thing

1005
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
And

1006
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,623
There's no reason why that needs to be undermined by bunch

1007
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
What does it mean

1008
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
Exist

1009
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:52,095
But we can we can make a conversation more balanced than that's really been our Focus

1010
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Consider

1011
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
300 million people

1012
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Will visit Reddit

1013
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
This month

1014
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,287
That's almost as big as the population United States

1015
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
And

1016
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,919
Vast vast vast majority those interactions and engagements

1017
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
Are not

1018
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
They're never reported by another user

1019
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
And they're actually

1020
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
Niner actually good

1021
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
But

1022
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
If anything

1023
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,487
It shows us how much more we have in common with each other than a park

1024
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,815
Because when you're on R / skincareaddiction

1025
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
You don't know anything else about the

1026
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
The hundreds of thousands of other people talking about

1027
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,727
Acne scars other than the fact

1028
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
You have this year

1029
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,335
And and whether it's about that or

1030
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
Putting arms on birds

1031
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,663

You find out you're not the only one who weirdly wanted

1033
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
How to put the Rock's arms on a parakeet

1034
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
And that's okay

1035
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,207
Because all people of all Creeds should be able to come together and put

1036
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,279
Dwayne Johnson's arms on a parakeet

1037
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Do you not agree

1038
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,983
You look skeptical

1039
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,103
Would someone in our / birds with arms put guys arms

1040
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871

Well guy what a man and a woman love each other yes

1065
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
How did we meet

1066
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,687
A couple years ago I was hungover overslept

1067
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,015
I was just I was actually at a conference that I really didn't want to be at

1068
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
But

1069
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
It was it was a good thing I went

1070
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
Cuz I overslept

1071
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
I need to coffee

1072
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
And they send me outside

1073
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
The sit by the pool

1074
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
And

1075
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
And there was a table next to me where they sat or where I sat

1076
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,167
There were four people there an item happens on I was just working on my laptop

1077
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
And then

1078
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
One of them

1079
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
Australian guy goes on mine

1080
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
As a rat

1081
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
Bile table

1082
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,711
I was like one that's fine like I'm up from Brooklyn to see rats all the time

1083
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
I'm thank you but okay

1084
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
And I know you trying to get me to leave cuz I wanted that table for the rest of the team and end of the world

1085
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:33,023
Woman who's next to him turn around was like I really enough not scared of rats and I was like no

1086
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
And

1087
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
And she's like what you doing here and I'll

And the

1091
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
And then someone else to the table was like oh wait what

1092
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Talking about it

1093
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Reddit

1094
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
General idea what read it was did you know who you were talking to

1095
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,951
But I've never literally never watch Tennis I didn't care for the sport

1096
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:08,095
I'm being honest I really do not care for the sport I want to I want to add something here with

1097
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
My favorites

1098
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Serena story

1099
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
Okay not something we talked about ahead of time but let's just do it live this is Trust

1100
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,615
So this was a

1101
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,151
As well

1102
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,223
It was like one of my first days on the job

1103
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
With Alexis over there on a Saturday

1104
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
It was during Wimbledon

1105
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
So

1106
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,647
Wimbledon live streaming on a screen near us

1107
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
And Alexis kisses text

1108
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
And it's just like

1109
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
Wall2wall kissy emoji

1110
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,935
Then I was like Serena

1111
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
And just then

1112
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,055
I look on the screen of Serena is coming

1113
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
Out of the tunnel

1114
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
On her phone we still will never know we'll never know

1115
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:06,975
Sounds like that I just watch Serena Williams send you a wall of wow

1116
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,303
Wow

1117
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,079
So you guys are back in Reddit

1118
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
You are

1119
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
Running this thing

1120
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,223
You just just raise a bunch of money

1121
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,575
I asked this question everybody comes in the show and I don't want to ask both of you to answer

1122
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:38,975
How much of what you think happened to you professionally is because of your skill and your talent and how much of it is

1123
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
Somebody observe this that I thought was very smart

1124
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Sunnyside

1125
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Success is the

1126
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Products

1127
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Intelligent

1128
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Hard work

1129
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
And lock

1130
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,847
You can't have a zero in any of those

1131
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
You know we started

1132
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,735
Internet company in 2005 when

1133
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,575
The kind of Web 2.0 the second wave of

1134
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,159
I'm smarter funding and smarter people were coming into the ecosystem

1135
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
I don't sometimes the that with the wind blows your way

1136
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
I'll tell you this

1137
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,839
If I went back 10 years ago and do everything I knew now

1138
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
It had to start right all over again

1139
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
I don't know if we

1140
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
Right it's just

1141
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
It's a Fickle thing these social sites

1142
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
And

1143
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,639
It's really all about the users and in what are they into

1144
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
And it's

1145
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
It's it's hard to say if we could do it

1146
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Again all over

1147
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
With even a perfect

1148
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,903
I'm personally heavy on the the left side

1149
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
I don't want to totally remove agency because

1150
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
Haunted work

1151
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Bottom

1152
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
I like that dirt you can't have a zero in any of the columns

1153
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
And it's so easy to look back on it and

1154
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
And just think

1155
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
All the dots

1156
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
Connected but

1157
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
There was no other forces at play to make it all work
