2019

18
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
How I built this Fellowship

19
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
The fellowship was started

20
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000

21
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Bring their business ideas

22
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
The life

23
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
But might need a little extra help.

24
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
To get there

25
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632

July 30th

35
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
So it was literally an afterthought that you would be able to write a review on Yelp

36
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
That teacher almost didn't exist and it was in fact Russ right before lunch that like I remember in Peking

37
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
How to write a review

38
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
No one's going to do that because we didn't think anyone would write reviews for fun

39
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
That was preposterous

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
From NPR how I built this

41
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
Innovators

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Entrepreneurs idealist

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Stories behind the movements

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
Gyros

45
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Places to drink and shop Yelp public company now value

46
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Billion dollars

47
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,016
Okay so think about the last time you read a review on the internet

48
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,344
And then use that review to help you make a decision

49
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
Maybe it was

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
Which restaurant to eat at

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Which brand of

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Toaster to buy on Amazon

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Or maybe even witch

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Podcasts to listen to

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Internet reviews

56
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Height of a fixture of Modern Life

57
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
Please review sites have put a lot of power in the hands of consumers

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Simatai powers

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Great customers

60
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Taco stand

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Barber shop

62
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
Can totally booster popularity

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
But at the same time

64
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Besides an ulcer

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Irritated a lot of business owners

66
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,392
Because one bad review can do a lot of damage to a business

67
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
People who got this whole thing started

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Is Jeremy stoppelman

69
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
Jeremy co-founded Yelp

70
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
2004

71
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
The story of how he did it well in a lot of ways it's a classic Silicon Valley startup story

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
Along the way as you will hear Jeremy cross

73
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Elon Musk Reid Hoffman Steve Jobs before any of that

74
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Pull up in Northern Virginia

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
He was born in 1977 his dad was a Securities lawyer in Washington DC

76
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Founders we have on the show

77
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,352
Jeremy was still a kid when the PC Revolution was happening

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Is that

79
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Brought home a computer for him and his brothers to play with I mean the first it was fascinating to learn

80
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
How the operating system words because of the dossier to the command prompt then it became very

81
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
Quickly about video games and that really sucked me in

82
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Epicurious well

83
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
How do you make these

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
Not really fun to play but like what behind them

85
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
Ants that starting out on a journey answer reading

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Another manual

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Just started

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
Uncovering the Mysteries

89
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Bit by bit

90
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
At age 14

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
You opened up a Charles Schwab

92
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Account

93
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Yeah probably

94
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
Tyson 2

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
And my dad being a

96
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
Involved in the sea

97
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Securities industry

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
And I was very interested in young companies and how they grow and

99
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
Buying and selling stocks founded

100
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Exciting to me

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,720
And then also you know you've been earlier before I opened that account that I was trading baseball cards even though I wasn't

102
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
I wasn't much of a baseball fan I was collect

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
And trading baseball

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
That was the baseball card bubble

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
In the early 80s

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
It was

107
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Side to my mom's Chagrin she still has boxes and boxes are worth nothing but but

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
Like a Jose Canseco rookie was going for

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Like 40 bucks yeah

110
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Yeah

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Side of

112
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
That's a lot of money in the

113
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Did you have a sense

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
What you wanted to do

115
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
With your life already at that point

116
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
I didn't dream of starting a tech

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
That began from a pretty early age

118
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Around the time that I was doing

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Investing for teen

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Yeah I was reading

121
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Forbes I know there was a

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Forbes is 14

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
There was a sex I think it's called out front

124
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
That would never tell entrepreneurial stories

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Not

126
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
Two similar to this podcast but a very brief Little Italy Ohio here's a

127
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,015
Couple of entrepreneurs here's what they're doing here that's going to taking off

128
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
And I just was really exciting to be the idea that you could

129
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Take technology Marriott

130
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
What business come up with a novel idea grow it into a thriving company like that is just something about that

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Exciting

132
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,495
Actually went to college at the University of Illinois where he studied computer engineering

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
Move to San Francisco where he got a job working for a company called

134
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
At home it was an early provider of high-speed cable internet

135
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,879
But it was a chaotic time for at home. Just completed a merger with another internet

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
Jeremy didn't last very long there

137
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
I was seeing and hearing enough weird stuff

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,167
Just like this is not the kind of place if they going to be long-term and because I was very lucky

139
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
There was 1999

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
And that man my phone was ringing off the hook

141
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,103
With recruiters trying to get me to go interview with other companies

142
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
So I was constantly tempted

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
Free LinkedIn recruiters finding out that you even existed

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Dial into the phone tree

145
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
So we called the company and then start pressing

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
Extensions or just going through that you know that

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Countries to try and

148
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,047
See if they can reach an engineer and then they would put you on all these startups

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Does company

150
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Yeah it's crazy times

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
And where did you laugh

152
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
So

153
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
In one of the startup

154
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Agreed to

155
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
To me it was one called x.com

156
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
Carrie's name to it fortunately it was not pornography nothing to do with anything typically associated with an axe

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
It was just an online bank

158
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Anyways

159
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
A little tiny office on University Avenue in Palo Alto

160
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Really bright individuals

161
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,559
That I interviewed with and then the last person that I met with

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
What's that day

163
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Was Elon Musk

164
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
And what was your impression of Elon Musk did he make an impression on you at the time

165
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
He made a strong impression

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
I definitely like them

167
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Right from the get-go

168
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
It was also

169
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Inspiring

170
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Now here is a 28 year old

171
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Put already sold another company

172
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Any of these incredible Ambitions for

173
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Somebody's going to need

174
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Yeah said right out of the gate or we're going to

175
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Take down Visa in master

176
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
And I thought

177
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Is it just kind of crazy like he's a

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
Crazy person yeah he's got this

179
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
Crazy idea that these insane Ambitions he's got a lot of confidence

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
It was kind of mind-blowing like

181
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
I don't know about this

182
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
This guy but I just have to

183
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
I have to see what's going to happen

184
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
Okay so so x.com

185
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
What are they do like what was their business

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
Yes.com originally started as a bank

187
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Turn online bank

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
It was very easy to sign up

189
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,207
Take your money from your bank account and shifted into things like an S&P 500 fund

190
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
High yield money market fund

191
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
I was doing some kind of

192
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,631
Cool Cutting Edge online banking stuff that was fairly new

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,263
But they also made it very easy to transfer money between accounts with just an email address

194
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
So if you want to text. Com account

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,199
Read me if you didn't I can send you a payment and then you could create an Xbox, count very quickly and get your money

196
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
PayPal is doing something very similar the only difference is they weren't running a bank they were just kind of a money transfer service

197
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
So

198
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
You accept a job with them

199
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
You become one of their engineers

200
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Was there a sense that you were building something

201
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Big

202
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
Is there like that kind of excitement or

203
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Or not necessarily that for now

204
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
I mean I'd say it was more than that

205
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
And by the time that I joined

206
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
There was already a product Market

207
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
It was already growing really fast

208
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Prius on eBay

209
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
Someone would win an auction on eBay they want to pay

210
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
And at that time there weren't a lot of really

211
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
Fast efficient easy online options

212
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Incel

213
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
X.com fill that Gap and then also confinity which was running the PayPal service

214
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Number one competitor was also.

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
It's all very much like we were in a

216
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Very scary race

217
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
We were

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,287
Worried every day who is going to win who is going to get ahead where we growing as fast as they were in vice versa

219
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
So she's very intense,

220
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Petition

221
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,175
And that first-year decks.com do you remember just working all the time

222
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Day in Day Out

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
It was pretty intense I mean

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,367
I was only at the company maybe two or three months before it was an ounce

225
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
PayPal

226
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Andexxa, merged

227
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
I'm so I had yet and intense 2 months

228
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
A fierce competition and stress

229
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
And then all the sudden

230
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Where all these new College

231
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,519
Your enemy becomes your work like I remember

232
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
Yeah we had a little like happy hour mixer type

233
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Big thing

234
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Where are the other teams got together

235
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
And it was

236
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
LOL yeah I was an interesting feel like I hear these people that you've been

237
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
Really worried about really stressed by but now

238
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Dear new colleagues

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
So in that merger you got

240
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
I mean I'm not going to name all the name

241
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Elon Musk

242
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Is there

243
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Peter thiel is there

244
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Max levchin is there

245
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
Maybe Reid Hoffman was was in that room

246
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Yep

247
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
Is it possible to look around the room thing

248
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Everyone in this room

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Is

250
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
I mean I would say

251
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
It was a bunch of ambitious

252
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Smart people right skillset

253
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
The right time but yeah I did I don't think you could have really predicted it

254
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Obviously Max was already

255
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Pretty far along for 24 year old so is it was obvious you know that he was going to be someone interesting in the industry computer deals

256
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
Same things I said the top Executives you probably had something

257
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
The other players in the industry but I'd say the rest of us we're just all

258
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
And just getting started

259
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
You got promoted to

260
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Head of engineer

261
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
The vice president

262
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Engineering

263
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Once that Mercer have

264
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
You are still

265
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Real young

266
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
2425

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Do that cuz all of a sudden you're like

268
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
I can charge him

269
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Least 20-30 maybe more people

270
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Yeah I mean a retrospective

271
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
It's pretty crazy

272
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
25 yet I wouldn't say I was

273
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
Super well qualified but you know we made it work

274
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
We put out a lot of features and functionality we kept the side up

275
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
That's what's important

276
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Bur

277
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
That was your you are an engineer

278
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
You're not a business

279
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Yeah I mean I think

280
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
I did have

281
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
An interesting combination of being able to connect

282
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Communicate

283
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Understand

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,599
People in other parts of the organization outside of engineering and then translate that

285
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Into you know the lingo in the Motions of

286
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Engineering

287
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
So as I

288
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Became an engineering lead in an engineering manager and so forth

289
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
It felt very natural and it felt like

290
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
I was actually pretty good at it

291
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
It's alright for me

292
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Yeah

293
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Just two years after the merger

294
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
K'Nex

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Common PayPal

296
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Gets sold

297
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
EBay acquired by

298
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Yeah we know the stories of

299
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Menus

300
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,063
Founders Inn where they they did did you walk away from that like

301
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Financially set could you have just

302
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
Not work ever again or or no

303
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
No

304
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,047
Pick up something like 1.4 1.5 billion dollars

305
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
Certainly top management got rich in the

306
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
Maxor Peter could have retired if that was there

307
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Wanted to do

308
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
But I think that's actually an interesting part of the story

309
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,175
If you had all these Bright Young ambitious people they definitely got capital I made some money

310
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
But it wasn't so much

311
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
That is necessarily was like

312
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
So you decided

313
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
The point

314
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
I might go to Business School

315
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Like you

316
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Been through a startup

317
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Acquisition

318
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
As an employee

319
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
You got a little money under but not enough to

320
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Live off

321
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Rest of your life so

322
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Business School

323
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Yeah

324
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
After

325
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
PayPal was bought by eBay

326
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Especially since I've gone through a merger x.com and PayPal

327
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Who's pretty

328
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
Traumatic

329
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Dramatic because

330
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
How to combine the two culture

331
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Yeah and there's so much

332
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Drama

333
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,831
Within the two companies once they were combined Elan was

334
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Like it was

335
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
It was pretty crazy

336
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Until when they took over I had a feeling it would also you know not be that fun to be a company that

337
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Maybe

338
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Swallowed up by very different cultures

339
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
And so forth inside it just

340
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Like all maybe I could go

341
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,287
Do business school maybe I could get him somewhere that would be a pretty good school and it let me look into that

342
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
And then I applied

343
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
If you different schools

344
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
And actually Harvard is the only one I got into

345
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,575
Some celebratory I was very excited

346
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,439
Pretty much wanted to go to sew it. I got very lucky on that and then went off to Business School

347
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
To buy going to sound like like going to Harvard Business School

348
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Wanted to

349
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
To get a better grasp

350
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Spawn like

351
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
All the

352
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
A part of that what

353
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Stemmed from

354
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
The Silicon Valley coming from wisdom at the time

355
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Leslie post.com

356
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Bust

357
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Was

358
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Founder engineer types

359
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Focus on engineering

360
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
Is I thought about getting an MBA that would

361
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
Round out my background to give me more flexibility

362
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,999
Give me more credibility like I did want to start a company which I still hope to do

363
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
It would be awfully hard for a venture capitalist

364
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
He probably has an NBA

365
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
To say oh you know I don't think

366
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Running the company

367
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Tickle work

368
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
I'm sorry. I thought it would be nice

369
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
Alright so the summer comes summer of after 4

370
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
2004

371
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
And you come back

372
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
2

373
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
San Francisco the Bay Area

374
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
For the summer

375
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
What was your plan that

376
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Well

377
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Month prior is actually coming back

378
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
I reached out to my old Network

379
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,327
Until I reach out to Elon I reach out to Peter till

380
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
Reach out to Max

381
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
And Peter right off the bat offered me an opportunity to come to Clarion capital

382
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
His investment arm

383
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
And it was very morphe

384
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
It's like we have no idea what exactly are you doing

385
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
But you say he's certainly a spot for me and

386
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Jacksepticeye

387
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,623
And then maybe a month later like Elon actually took a little while to get back to me and I think it's about a month later

388
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,975
B-Line reach out and said no you should come work for me at basic

389
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
And it's kind of a funny question

390
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,399
What would have happened if you wanted responded faster I probably would have gone to SpaceX just cuz

391
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
I don't know headphone versus

392
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Rocket ship

393
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
I might be tempted by the rocket ship come from

394
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
For the summer

395
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,479
Yes I arrived in San Francisco and I meet up with Peter in his office and he mentions

396
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
You know what

397
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Max

398
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Has a open up an incubator

399
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,975
Call Demerol Ventures I'm an investor until he essentially offered me the opportunity instead to go work with Macs

400
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Cheap Uconnect with Max levchin

401
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
He said he get working on incubator

402
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,191
So I got to Max's little office little dumpy office

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Recliner room and

404
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,871
Yeah they were it was just a bunch of different folks working on little internet ideas

405
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
Now what's going to be the next big thing on the internet

406
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
Which I actually was intrigued by

407
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,879
And I thought what is a fun exercise like I've always wanted to start a company here it it's like this is

408
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,279
Is it a trial run for me to see if I could come up with a compelling idea that I could pitch Maxon that he would actually get excited

409
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,119
What were some of the ideas that you were thinking about maybe starting

410
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
I had a bunch of

411
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
Silly ideas probably the silliest that I can remember

412
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Was

413
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
And idea for a joke phone call

414
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Site

415
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
You can go there and you can

416
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Pay for

417
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,039
A phone call to be sent to a friend or something like that

418
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Another that was actually

419
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Pretty close to a good idea

420
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
What I did realized that

421
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
The economics

422
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
On

423
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Streaming video head

424
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Gotten a lot better

425
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
But I didn't have the full inside I just

426
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,215
That there was something going on a video that was intriguing but I had to put that one on the Shelf

427
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
There was

428
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
Some interest with an incubator around the local space it was

429
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
And we were observing that

430
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Craigslist

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Who's killing the newspaper

432
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Business

433
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
Bicarbonat classifieds

434
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
I said put a spotlight on the yellow page

435
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,903
Looks like hey here's another old media business that hasn't really been transformed by the internet

436
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
You can look up

437
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Basic information

438
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
You know an address or phone number

439
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
And said I got to figure out what would be

440
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
No better than the Yellow Pages

441
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,983
And as I thought about it talk about it with my co-founder rushing into is another

442
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Early PayPal person

443
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
It reviews

444
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Capturing word-of-mouth bringing it online

445
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
You're marrying it was social networking which was motor technology that was just emerging yet kind of friends her in Myspace

446
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
Send intriguing but we didn't think you could create a social network

447
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
Just around reviewing thought

448
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
I'd be a mechanism

449
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Russell Simmons

450
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791
He was someone you knew from PayPal he was just

451
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
He was also at Mr event

452
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Yeah

453
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Yeah that's what I came to the incubator

454
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Kiwis

455
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
And one of the people that I most frequently

456
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
I would spit ball with and bounce ideas.

457
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
4th and actually

458
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
I give him credit for being very encouraging

459
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Took us about

460
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,271
Couple months baby month and a half or so really zeroing an idea

461
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
And when

462
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Trying to come up with

463
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
A new business idea in this case new internet idea like

464
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,303
You feel like you're spinning your tires are not productive you don't know what you did the whole day is he's got there speaking in like

465
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
Jotting down notes and ideas

466
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
Sometimes I feel like I was just getting nowhere and who

467
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Yeah

468
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,031
How is very positive and like know you're on the right track with keep doing this and

469
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Until we're actually out

470
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,175
Batting around this review social networking and how but what's the mechanism

471
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,039
And I said to him and let you know what like if you ask me a question

472
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
And what's a good doctor in San Francisco like I like I love to be the expert I love to reply in my

473
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Give you this helpful information

474
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
I thought of this sort of like back and forth conversation questions

475
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Npip emerge well maybe we can build

476
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Aside around asking friends for recommendation

477
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
And so we thought

478
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,823
Withnail the car that we thought we had a mechanism that would pull reviews out of people because of course

479
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
We didn't think anyone would write reviews

480
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Preposterous

481
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
It's only got back to the office

482
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
And we were just like bubbling with the

483
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
Excitement we saw that we know how to do this local thing

484
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
What were you going to recommend

485
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Like what kind of businesses

486
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
Well whatever business that you happen to need you could turn to the service and say you know hey

487
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,655
I'm looking for a great sushi restaurant in San Francisco

488
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
And then I would blast out to your friends and then your friends would click a link could just be able to type the name of the place in my quick note and then it would be

489
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
You saved in this

490
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
In his sight until overtime would build up his incredible wealth of knowledge around recommendations and everybody's had

491
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
The initial idea

492
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
Cleric post public reviews

493
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,095
When you would be asked you would ask that the central part was like coming ask a question

494
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Of your friends

495
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,471
It would email your friends to click a link they could submit reviews back to you

496
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
It was a half-baked idea

497
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,639
But we're excited and that's what matters

498
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,735
So you Russ come up with this idea to have like

499
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
A website

500
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Where people to get recommendation

501
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
You take it to Max election

502
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
You say

503
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Emacs

504
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Here we go

505
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
And he says

506
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
He says

507
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
I'm not sure

508
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,935
It is generally like a poker face kind of guy but he was he was like nah

509
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
I don't know maybe

510
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
You seemed really excited about it that's good so why don't you think about it

511
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Overnight

512
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
And then if you're still excited about it tomorrow

513
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Then I guess I'll find

514
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Would you leave

515
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Pitch deck

516
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Getting a business

517
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Just like

518
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Tiny butt

519
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,928
Yeah I mean I've got to come back and talk to Max about that moment

520
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
And I think what he would say is

521
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
He was just excited at the combination of

522
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
Of me teaming up with Ross

523
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,936
And the fact that we're both like engaged in fired up to try something and he figured

524
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,312
Something good will come of it might this might not be the idea but like if they get Off to the Races

525
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
And part of it is

526
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
Maxwell surprise himself at getting people

527
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Dropout of school 2

528
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
Pursue business opportunities

529
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
I think he also saw it as an opportunity to you know

530
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
Hear me in a different direction than finishing Business School

531
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
And get me involved in a project which could turn into some

532
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Did Russell Simmons

533
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Before you got the money from Max

534
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Silver Sable

535
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
What are you going to do like you're going back to

536
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
School a couple

537
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:02,752
I mean that conversation basically started as soon as we got Siri like once we had the idea once Max it signed off on it

538
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
That

539
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,104
Began a process of me figuring out what my options were

540
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Sorry

541
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
He has started

542
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Researching

543
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Could I defer a business

544
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
And unfortunately pretty quickly I realized

545
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
That it was not very difficult

546
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Call to defer my degree

547
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
So you decide all right I'm going to

548
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
I'll drop at 4

549
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
I will start this thing up and end

550
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
How much did Max give you gas

551
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
Smacks committed to the million dollars

552
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
He got a

553
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,520
A large chunk of equity as it was 40%

554
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Yeah I know we just started

555
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Working on the product

556
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
It's interesting because clearly like you work

557
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
With Max at

558
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
PayPal he knew you he knew Russ

559
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
You didn't have a business

560
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
You didn't have spread

561
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Cheats of how much money you would make

562
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
He just

563
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Gave you a million dollars

564
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
He must have really believed

565
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
That you guys

566
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Make something work cuz that's

567
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Even for a rich guy that's that's arrest

568
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
I mean definitely it was

569
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
It was bold to commit

570
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Real money

571
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
To these very high risk

572
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
Projects man he had essentially three or four

573
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,384
He might have been for the total count in the incubator

574
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Out of those two

575
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
To really worked out

576
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
And then to did not

577
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Oh yeah

578
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
I mean I think that's the nature of the Beast

579
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Open Silicon Valley is

580
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
You're working on very high-risk projects its R&D

581
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,536
Fight nature most of the projects are good portion them are not going to go anywhere

582
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Ideally want a portfolio approach

583
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
If you can make that happen

584
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,752
I want to ask you a kind of delicate question here which I think is important for people to

585
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
That's enough understand when starting a business

586
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
Max had

587
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Capitals world quiz

588
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
He gave you a million dollars which you needed to start this

589
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,016
Company but you had to give up

590
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
40%

591
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Of the company

592
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
That point

593
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Do you think that

594
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
At that point

595
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
You just did not have a better option like that was

596
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Truly the best option to take

597
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
I would say

598
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
Given the circumstances of the time

599
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
In a 2004

600
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
We're still recovering from the.com

601
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
Answer the idea that

602
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,944
Yeah 26 27 year old would be working on an internet start-up was just very out-of-favor like

603
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
No it like that was part of

604
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
I think we all definitely were successful as they were just so few people

605
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,928
Working on new internet ideas in 2003-2004 around that time.

606
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:34,816
And so you know Max was early and he was one of the few so I think he and I deserve the equity that he got

607
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,704
Artsy U business school and you guys start working on Yelp

608
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,080
And and I read that in that fall fall of 2004 where you guys are going to work on this

609
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
The name that you really wanted to call it was Yoko

610
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Like

611
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Local

612
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Which action is it like name

613
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
What happened to Yoko

614
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
I mean I thought

615
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
We would combined local and Yokel

616
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
And then I went to go and try and buy the domain

617
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
And there was someone that

618
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
That wouldn't part with it

619
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Offer any amount of money

620
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
It's that proofs frustrating

621
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,728
And there was a another guy named debater David Galbraith

622
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Who

623
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,592
Was thinking about it as well and he was the one that came up

624
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
With y'all

625
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
And we pitched it to us he was like help help

626
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
Yelp Yellow Pages

627
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
So I had some

628
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
We are really smart connect

629
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,368
And it also turned out that you can buy for $5,000 right there

630
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
By putting in your credit card like a domain squatter

631
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
Found it and had put up a page saying it's for sale

632
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Savannah

633
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Two other folks

634
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,376
Overheard the conversation in the incubator came over and

635
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
One of them was Scott banister

636
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Who have been involved funny enough in the naming a paper

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
The PayPal actually

638
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Paint of a fancy consultancy

639
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Degenerative

640
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
Inside got back a hundred different option

641
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Scott Bannister is a friend Max

642
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
Pointed out immediately PayPal

643
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Scikit PayPal we have to go to PayPal and like

644
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Canvas Knox

645
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Geneva name

646
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
It's a similar late when he heard y'all peep I bet your name you're crazy

647
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
We're buying it right now

648
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
And then he and this other guy Jared's at Town him

649
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
I bought the domain for us

650
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
And

651
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
How we got that was at

652
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
That was all right so you've got

653
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
This thing that

654
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:24,128
Your building and by the way I mean $1000000 a lot of money but you got to pay people you've got server space again

655
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Right

656
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,552
That's not going to last that long so I had to assume you quickly had to go out looking for more money

657
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Yeah

658
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
When we got pretty far along

659
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,696
Building site within 3 or 4 months

660
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
And right before launching

661
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:45,376
Emacs encourages us to go pitch so I went and hit the road

662
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,984
Sandhill Road and talk to maybe

663
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
10 or 15 different forms

664
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
And since we got locked out of the room

665
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
It did not go well now

666
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
What were the questions for you like

667
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,064
Do they not understand what it was I can understand that

668
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,416
By the way it wasn't entirely clear that point website

669
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
People just volunteer

670
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,280
Information to get the email drowned like what's going on

671
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
That's her

672
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,656
I don't blame them

673
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,496
Pushback was it actually had nothing to do with the ideas so much as

674
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
The people presenting it

675
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
So in our case we're young

676
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
For technical interview

677
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,504
Kind of like what happened in the late 90s and so everyone still have PTSD from the.com bust

678
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Who are the common refrains to me was and is it straight to my face was like Hey you know yeah this idea is kind of interesting week

679
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
We might be willing to fund it perhaps but

680
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
Would you be willing to step aside so

681
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
What weekend is it

682
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
A real quote

683
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
We can bring in a gray heritage

684
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Wow

685
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,472
Like I was a casa conventional wisdom was like we need adult supervision

686
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Executive

687
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
And so there was this feeling that enough

688
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
With the kids already

689
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Yeah we need

690
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Established

691
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Professionals

692
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
If we're going to find some sort of

693
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
Your new venture

694
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Were you were

695
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
Preparing to Launch

696
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
And I guess

697
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
By the end of 2004

698
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Right

699
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,280
October 2004 are you able to raise any outside money before then

700
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Million dollars in financing

701
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
We started conversations with

702
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Venture capitalist

703
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
The weeks

704
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
Prior to launch in an extended all the way through launch

705
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
And of course when the launch happened we got some initial press

706
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
Stuart Little

707
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Obit of Industry price

708
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
But also our data

709
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Is people are trying to use

710
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
The site was not

711
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Super encouraging

712
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,112
It was not you launch this thing in October of 2000

713
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
4 +

714
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
What no one shows up

715
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
The party

716
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,072
Pretty much you know our moms were on it and maybe some friends

717
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
Did any part of that sap your confidence

718
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah that was a very dark.

719
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
I was pretty worried that I had

720
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
Made a mistake and that I was leading the team off a cliff

721
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Come back in just a moment and Jeremy his team relaunch the Yelp website with some important changes

722
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,720
And it started to see people besides their own mother actually use the site

723
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:24,096
And also the moment Jeremy got an unexpected phone call and some advice

724
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,472
Gyros are you listening to how I built this

725
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104

They took email marketing animated

733
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Radically easy

734
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
So the big thinkers to focus on

735
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728

NPR

Right

802
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Co-founder Russell Simmons launch

803
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Yelp

804
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
Really no one is

805
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Using service

806
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
At this point Yelp is

807
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Primarily a website

808
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
People ask their friends and only their friend

809
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
For specific recommendations

810
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
InStep model

811
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
Clearly isn't taking off

812
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Jeremy sits down

813
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
To get an idea of what people

814
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424
If there was one really critical

815
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,264
Inside that we had as we were looking at the data

816
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,384
Which center around review writing so it was literally an afterthought

817
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,016
That you would be able to write a review on Yelp without being asked a question that feature almost didn't exist

818
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
And it was in fact

819
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Ross

820
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:01,184
Right before lunch that like I remember him peeking over

821
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
Should there be a way

822
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Write a review

823
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,584
If nobody asked you a question you just brought it wanted to write one of my

824
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
No one's going to do that

825
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
You know what

826
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Why we added in somewhere

827
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Prince.

828
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
And it turned out you know something

829
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,872
Precocious users would find that feature and when did right

830
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,784
The first review they would then go on to write a second or third degree that you can see in the data like I could just see that when someone wrote a review

831
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
More often than not

832
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
The right stuff

833
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
If there was something

834
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
Obviously entertaining or interesting or

835
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Cathartic about reading reviews

836
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,560
And so with that Insight we started rethinking how we designed the site

837
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
And instead of being about

838
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
Asking friends for recommendations

839
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,472
Maybe it should be a platform for you

840
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
To recommend things just to The Wider world

841
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,872
And so we redesigned and put the emphasis on you

842
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
We gave you a profile that is

843
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,712
Those are borrowed from the social media world

844
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
We also you know took a page out of the blogging Playbook

845
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Working say your reviews showing

846
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Chronological order on your profile

847
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,464
And a bunch of this features and functionality we bundled up

848
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
And Central

849
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Relaunched

850
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Recite in February

851
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
You're sort of thinking okay

852
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Let's relaunch this

853
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Yes and

854
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Give people

855
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
You know the power to

856
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Evaluate

857
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Sting whatever they're using

858
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
And then

859
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
We'll see what happens

860
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
Shifted from

861
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,992
Hey the only way that we're going to get reviews is if you're asked a question to

862
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
Hey maybe reviews are for myself

863
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Expression

864
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
You're just like someone write a blog for

865
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
You're fun to talk about what's going on in their life

866
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Or what have you

867
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Like some people want to talk about restaurant

868
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Answer some people want to

869
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Yeah I talked about it a great mom and pop business

870
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Patronized in like

871
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
There's actually people out there that want to do that

872
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,216
Frankly I could identify as one of those people because I was doing it I was getting I was like

873
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
This is fine

874
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
I want to do this

875
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
2

876
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Erie Lodge

877
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
The option return

878
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
Review and then

879
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
Blow up or is it still kind of quiet

880
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,064
With the relaunch February 2005 it did feel

881
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
This really different

882
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:11,744
You know when we rolled out all the new features and functionality within hours we were seeing people pop up on the site that

883
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
We didn't know

884
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
Wasn't a relative

885
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,400
Weather friend like we have no idea who that person is in the writing review

886
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Is that pretty cool

887
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,496
Yeah it didn't mean that we were like I hope you know jobs done let's

888
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
What's lean back in like wait for the sites

889
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,824
Growl like we still had

890
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
Tons of things to figure out and work to do

891
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
Be there soon after launch

892
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,760
We started thinking about will how do we really jell the community that's here in Sanford

893
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
I'm just trying to participate on our site

894
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
Yeah we did our first in-person meet up

895
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
I was some early users and that was

896
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
A total surprise

897
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
You invited them

898
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
To like Gathering what

899
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Talk about

900
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
Restaurants Catholic what would you do

901
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:55,008
Yeah interesting Lee like right around the time that we were about to relaunch I hired a marketing person

902
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
It said this Market person Nash

903
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
One of his first suggestions right as soon as we had some users

904
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,968
Was let's meet him and

905
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
We work on the

906
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Products like I

907
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Do the wire frames that I work with Russ and we figure stuff out I don't go and meet people that's hot

908
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
I don't do that

909
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
You know you got to do what you got to do it and say he arranged me of it was like two users people we

910
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
We have no idea who they were and we met up you have for happy hour nearby bar and the crazy

911
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,664
I assumed that the first users of Yelp would be early adopters

912
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
You know my mind were technology site but I would actually say the early users of Yelp Urban early adopter

913
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
They're looking for what's new and cool and interesting in our city

914
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:47,744
The focus is like what the honey restaurant you've been to that booty that's really cool

915
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,376
And frankly the demographics for different it wasn't all a bunch of Engineers and young men

916
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
Those first two users both women actually

917
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
So

918
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
You got that million dollars in the summer of

919
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Mm

920
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
4

921
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,432
I meant that it was only in like November of 05 or you got

922
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Really the first

923
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Outside raise

924
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
$5000000

925
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Soap so that million dollars

926
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Was it raining out

927
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,184
We were definitely getting down to the

928
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,536
Lower end of that initial financing I think by the time we see

929
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Secured

930
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Are Aron financing

931
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
You're pretty close

932
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Baidu

933
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,984
One thing that did seem to be happening is like it did feel like

934
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,800
The company with Ally users

935
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,104
We had traffic numbers going up into the right

936
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,712
Yeah certainly wasn't all figured out and I wasn't 100% confident

937
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
I'm still a little gun-shy because we've been shot down

938
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
So badly you know the year prior

939
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,512
But you know as I gauge the reaction that I was getting from metacarpal side of some sense of what I think we have enough to raise

940
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Did you get what you get nervous when he would pet

941
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
I'm definitely

942
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Especially like actually approved to be

943
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Super valuable

944
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,776
And when Max pushed us to do the fundraise write it

945
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
The first launch in October 2004

946
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
In one of his

947
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
Reasons that he gave why we should do it is just like crack

948
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Doesn't hurt

949
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
And

950
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,552
Yeah that ended it like I was super nervous I'm sure

951
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
That time around because I

952
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
Didn't know what I was getting into eye

953
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
I never talked to

954
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,744
Capillus really like I just had no idea what's going on

955
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:29,376
And so when we went around the second time I at least knew what the office is look like I knew it

956
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,192
People look like I knew what some of the questions would be

957
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
I came with more experience

958
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
I'm sure it came through

959
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,032
Yeah but I was still

960
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
You know young and just figuring things out so I'm sure I wasn't

961
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
I mean

962
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
Did you have like an inner voice that was sort of

963
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,808
Imagine you're in your twenties you've got a bunch of people now

964
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Put their Laden

965
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
What company are you saying yourself

966
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,768
Who are you why do you think you can make this work

967
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
I need my biggest fear was

968
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
We had so obviously we knew that we could

969
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,192
Bill you know use full internet

970
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
Service like we can make it functional design features

971
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,664
We could engineer then we can put it out there the question was could we connect the parts so that it turned into something that people really love

972
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,272
And also top-of-mind was Max was one of my most

973
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
Valuable

974
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Professional contacts and hit committed $1000000

975
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
Would seem like an awful lot of money

976
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,560
And I was terrified that I was going to let him down and then I probably would only get one shot at this

977
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,680
So was yeah there's a lot going on I was definitely worried about the implications of

978
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
We didn't figure it out

979
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
There is a llama say

980
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Fetishization of

981
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
Failure in Silicon Valley you know

982
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:50,528
Culture of a fail fast Fail Hard

983
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
People

984
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
People who've already had some success

985
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,696
Or you know what that the stakes of failure aren't that high

986
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,256
And it sounds like you were actually really

987
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
Terrified feeling there's no glory in Failure nobody wants to fail

988
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
I mean obviously I do think

989
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,776
Silicon Valley can be quite forgiving a failure

990
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
True

991
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
But it's still not pleasant and you don't want to do it

992
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
If you can avoid it

993
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
And I remember a

994
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,992
A guy who is branded a Serial entrepreneur

995
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Told me

996
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:27,392
I'm only a Serial entrepreneur because it hasn't worked out Nobody Wants To Be A Serial entrepreneur

997
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Yeah

998
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
So when you finally raised money

999
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
After the first million that Max

1000
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
KVUE

1001
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,656
When the investor said okay how are you going to make money

1002
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
M5

1003
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
What did you say

1004
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
What was your plan

1005
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Giving it

1006
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,152
A ton of thought between looking at Google and how they were making money

1007
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
App search ads

1008
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
And looking at citysearch

1009
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Which

1010
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Leo had something similar

1011
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
On the local space it felt like other some obvious business model

1012
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
We don't have to

1013
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Worry too much

1014
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,232
You know not time is it something that makes ensign

1015
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
It was worth pursuing

1016
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Did Yelp

1017
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
Pretty much

1018
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Naturally

1019
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Kind of

1020
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Just become

1021
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Primarily

1022
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Restaurant

1023
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Review site initially was at

1024
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
That would happen

1025
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Definitely one user join

1026
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Yelp

1027
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,640
And get excited by reviewing

1028
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
They tend to

1029
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
Start with restaurant

1030
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,528
And part of that is because you have so many top-of-mind

1031
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,088
It's really fun to talk about all your favorites

1032
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
Send the dishes that you had

1033
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
It's

1034
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Super Freak

1035
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,744
So just living your life you always experience more restaurant and have more to talk about

1036
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Where has

1037
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,096
Yeah hopefully you don't use a plumber very often

1038
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
I mean maybe a great plumber

1039
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
Obviously people do talk about that on Yelp and that's

1040
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Great

1041
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
But it's not a great

1042
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Starting point

1043
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
For fun

1044
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
And frankly that was

1045
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
The part of the key to all success as we tried to make y'all

1046
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
For the reviewers

1047
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Really about fun

1048
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
You know why are they spending their time with

1049
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
That is why are they

1050
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,575
Writing these great funny interesting reviews

1051
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
It's because it's a hobby is

1052
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,903
It's something to do contributes

1053
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
And we always try to focus on making sure that Yelp is

1054
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
So

1055
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
Initially like XO as you continue to raise money

1056
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
5

1057
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
10 million

1058
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Was there any

1059
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Revenue coming in or was it just

1060
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
The idea that the

1061
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
At least initially was just

1062
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
Get more and more user

1063
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,639
Mostly was focused on growing the community of reviewers

1064
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
More content more reviews

1065
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
Recently added photos

1066
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
And also it with all that content

1067
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
10K more traffic

1068
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
Because the more review content we had generally the more we would show up within Google

1069
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Web search

1070
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:43,583
And therefore that would attract more users which would increase the size of the community you know it's art created this positive feedback loop

1071
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,191
Yeah from a business model standpoint it was something on our minds

1072
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
So it was probably

1073
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
End of 2006

1074
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,847
That we really got serious about building out advertising

1075
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Products

1076
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,735
And eventually landed on pretty simple ad model and it's actually have a Yellow Pages business works

1077
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Newspaper business work

1078
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,831
Magazine doesn't work so we just started with that because it was

1079
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
The least friction business is already knew what we were

1080
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Point

1081
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Or you can dress like

1082
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Able to actually see that

1083
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,631
This wasn't to turn a corner but this was actually becoming

1084
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,519
A million unique Visitors by the middle of 2006 so

1085
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
2 years after

1086
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
Max levchin

1087
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
That's a lot of unique

1088
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Visitors

1089
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
Summer 2005

1090
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Was really about getting the

1091
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:40,671
In out getting the initial momentum which was really San Francisco so getting a San Francisco community of Katrina

1092
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Readers writers reviewers

1093
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Going

1094
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,303
And you're showing that that would result in trap

1095
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
Once we got

1096
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
Financing the question

1097
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,191
Became what can you do it anywhere else

1098
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Is it just the San Francisco phenomena and actually like that was the funny thing trying to raise

1099
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
That round of financing

1100
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
Yeah the most common question was like well San Francisco

1101
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Is that just unique

1102
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,527
It's a bunch of hippies they like to help other people

1103
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
This isn't going to work in New York

1104
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,415
And I said that was what once we had the money on board

1105
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:18,815
That's what we aim to figure out it's like can we get it to grow and happen in New York can we get it in LA can we get in Seattle

1106
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
It's a 2006

1107
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
That's really what we were focused on was

1108
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
Spreading city-by-city

1109
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,311
Make sure that that we filled the Gap and you know competitor couldn't be us

1110
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:34,175
But also to prove that the model really good scale at least across the US

1111
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
When the iPhone came out

1112
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
You cash

1113
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:43,647
Pretty early I thought you wanted earliest apps on there so did you know or did you feel like right away this is going to be is it going to be

1114
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Change everything

1115
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:50,559
For us yeah I mean we had enough experience with mobile liquid built a website

1116
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,607
Which was like a early

1117
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
Version of the web for really crappy

1118
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
Mobile phones

1119
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,287
And it was very stripped-down and pretty much unusable

1120
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,871
And we need the Internet really wasn't happening on mobile device

1121
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Until we saw the ice

1122
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
It was just

1123
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Obvious

1124
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,039
Is that okay finally the web has arrived on the phone this is really

1125
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Exciting so we knew we

1126
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,415
Did you get involved to play some role we adapt our site something was going to happen to

1127
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
Make room in end

1128
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Service fee iPhone

1129
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,815
So we actually had a nap ready to go day 1

1130
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
Albany app store open

1131
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
When you launched

1132
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
In the App Store

1133
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Have an impact on your business

1134
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
It didn't have

1135
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,103
No I mean that there was no real business impact right away

1136
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Is it feel like

1137
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,199
Very important for the future in the long-term health of the company

1138
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,855
You know where time you were pretty small startups till we have very scarce resources so committing real resources to building an app

1139
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Was controversial

1140
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Within the company

1141
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
But it did feel like

1142
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
This is a historic device this is the future we have to be there we can't

1143
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Restaurant in Laurel

1144
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
I think that we're going to still be winning this game if we don't

1145
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Win-win mobile

1146
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
So

1147
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
With

1148
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
This kind of Prada

1149
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Write with a reviews

1150
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
With that territory

1151
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
Really pissed off business owners right because

1152
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
They're going to be restaurant

1153
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,759
How to get three or four star reviews or bad reviews

1154
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
And you guys

1155
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
It was some class action lawsuit

1156
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,671
I mean yeah Yelp has always been controversial

1157
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Because

1158
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
We host people's opinions

1159
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Hence

1160
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
And not every business

1161
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,399
I want to hear the feedback or is open to the feedback

1162
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
It's not

1163
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
Totally dissimilar to a restaurant

1164
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Critical

1165
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:39,103
Restaurants have a love-hate relationship with their local restaurant critic or certainly did you know the years

1166
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Past

1167
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
Where are sure if they got a great review they thought

1168
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,503
The restaurant critic was wonderful but if they got a negative review they were

1169
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
Upside

1170
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,623
No take that and multiply it times millions of users

1171
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
And get to be added

1172
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
Christian conversation

1173
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,743
But ultimately

1174
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
Having all this word-of-mouth exist anyways

1175
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Bring it online

1176
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,959
Create a lot of value for society book for small business owners who cannot stand out

1177
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Wake me up with relatively modest Market

1178
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
King budgets

1179
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
If they deliver Great Value great service

1180
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,687
You have their word-of-mouth is right there for everyone to see their great reviews are there

1181
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,247
But it does come with obviously the occasional

1182
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Negative review everyone gets done

1183
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
And that that hurts

1184
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,391
Get on the flip side I mean I feel like

1185
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
Everyone has had this experience where you look up your favorite restaurant or whatever it is on what album

1186
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,935
I love that place has to be right

1187
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:42,335
Well Everyone's entitled to their opinion so if you think you know the four star place should be five well

1188
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
Open their Red Review and I think the reason why y'all has been successful for so long and such a strong brand

1189
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Because like more often than not

1190
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
But it says 4 and 1/2 stars and there's a couple thousand reviews there you can be pretty darn confident that business is doing something for you

1191
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
Lockhart

1192
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
You guys got an offer from Google

1193
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Into thing is 2009

1194
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:10,239
Buy you out for reporting for half a billion dollars

1195
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
Totally life-changing money for you

1196
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
And

1197
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,431
Your partners in investors like you all could have walked away

1198
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
And then you could have started your next thing

1199
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Why didn't you take it

1200
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
It was a complicated dynamic

1201
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Nowhere

1202
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
Doing quite well

1203
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
It's interesting at that time to

1204
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Considered cozying up

1205
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
Do Google which has a worldwide presence is where canto

1206
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Completing sword International

1207
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Expansion

1208
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Wasn't an easy call

1209
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
And there is a course like

1210
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,287
Behind the scenes dynamic between Executives and

1211
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
We had we had been

1212
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
Staunch critic of Google

1213
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,015
Even then and continue to dinner to this day that they were scrubbing

1214
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
The internet and

1215
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Taking the reviews and

1216
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Present

1217
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
Is what their own information or what

1218
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,439
Yeah I mean

1219
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
We started by licensing our content

1220
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
To them

1221
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
In a way that

1222
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
We thought was reasonable and then over time

1223
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,911
It became clear that they really wanted to compete with us directly

1224
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
And collect reviews themselves

1225
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,287
And so then they said to us while we're going to collect reviews but we still want you

1226
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Who said we're not going to

1227
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:23,455
Compete with ourselves in your Yelp like property that you're building that makes no sense so thank you very much

1228
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Like we're done

1229
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
I said that actually prompted the car

1230
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Well maybe we should

1231
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,647
Is it really all right well you know where venture-backed we have to have the

1232
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Now we have to take

1233
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
That's seriously macondo

1234
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Completed it

1235
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
And ultimately

1236
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,119
I couldn't get together and we saw very exciting independent path and

1237
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,423
Taking additional financing and then going public

1238
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
And that

1239
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
Was equally exciting to me then you're not getting swallowed up by Google

1240
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
When Google offered

1241
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
I read that

1242
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Steve Jobs called you

1243
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Yeah

1244
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
True

1245
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Is it crazy to get a call from

1246
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Steve Jobs

1247
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
It was crazy

1248
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
It was probably one of the craziest moments

1249
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
My career still to this day

1250
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Yeah he said

1251
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Don't tell the Google

1252
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,791
We think you're great company

1253
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
We think what you're doing really interesting

1254
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,191
Didn't say I will Apple in as interested you but he did say

1255
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
Is this about money

1256
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,031
Because apple has a lot of money

1257
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,639
And if you need financing or something like that you got my number now so you should call me

1258
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
And

1259
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
No I thought that was probably blowing smoke

1260
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:34,367
It was pretty wild it was very surreal cuz he was at was like when I picked up the phone at

1261
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:41,023
And heard his voice I was afraid it was like talking to God

1262
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:47,423
Even so right when that deal with Google is on the table billion dollars

1263
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,823
2009 it must have been difficult to say to say no to walk away from that right

1264
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,711
It was definitely not an easy decision for anyone involved financially but it also felt like

1265
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,879
We don't have to do it we have a bright future we could take the company public we had full confidence that we could do that we knew that there were in about

1266
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
Masters ready to finance us but

1267
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:16,095
The independent pathlight prior to that moment I did see myself as kind of a young entrepreneur

1268
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,959
I'm not a public company CEO I really didn't think that I would ever be a public company CEO

1269
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:27,359
But that moment force me to seriously contemplate was that true

1270
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
Could I never imagined myself as a public company CEO and

1271
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
What I thought I might not be comfortable but some of my best decisions are the ones that push me out

1272
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
My comfort zone and cyan. The more I thought about it the more exciting I might maybe I'm going to fall on my face

1273
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:49,631
It's pretty exciting on the last at all so I'm growing into being a real what I would call real CEO

1274
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:55,775
Headed towards the public markets really see myself that way I'm curious

1275
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
When you get

1276
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Criticized

1277
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
Like I already did an AMA on Reddit

1278
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Back in

1279
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
There's some people just said mean

1280
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,783
Right next to the public eye

1281
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,087
I get mean comment

1282
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
Unsocial media

1283
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,207
You care about any of that doesn't even ever get you

1284
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Down

1285
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
I think if you're doing anything important in the world

1286
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Then you will have critics

1287
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,399
You'll have people that don't like the dynamic

1288
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,191
I haven't been created

1289
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,983
They don't like the powershift

1290
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,287
Yeah they like the old way of doing things

1291
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
And so

1292
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
You do have to take it with a grain of salt

1293
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,663
Like certainly had moments to get down

1294
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
Especially if you spend too much time reading

1295
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,503
All the critics but

1296
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
You know and there's also room to learn

1297
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Trump critics

1298
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,207
Guyana times we've adapted or we are kind of heard what people are saying and tried to

1299
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Mitigate

1300
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
Some of the problems that people are trying to bring to art

1301
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,887
Until you don't want to completely cover your ears and it frankly that's what I would tell

1302
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Your local businesses

1303
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
I don't want to hear it from the reviewers

1304
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,823
But the fact about her is like in this is true with y'all to most people actually like you

1305
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,383
Human nature to focus on the negative

1306
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
We all do it

1307
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,711
How we remember it more strongly

1308
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,039
As I think it's important to try and like pay attention to positive

1309
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
And that'll keep you

1310
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
When you think about

1311
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Where are y'all busy

1312
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,951
Slayer public company your

1313
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
The CEO of Apple company

1314
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Heading towards Augusta

1315
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,815
Billion dollars

1316
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,399
That boy remind me to eat would that mean we're talking about

1317
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,983
You going down Sandhill Road like nervously kind of

1318
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
Pitching to VCS who are

1319
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,823
Poking holes in your idea and

1320
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Not particularly impressed

1321
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,919
I wasn't that long ago

1322
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Yeah

1323
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,271
But I do feel like Canada

1324
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Proverbial frog in the pot

1325
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
Certainly now as you lay it out

1326
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Tess pretty wild

1327
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,327
But it has felt like I just very natural progression and always challenging and there's

1328
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
You know I always knew

1329
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
Things coming up the

1330
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
Problems are trying to solve and goals you're trying to meet

1331
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,287
The twisty-turny path it hasn't been like a straight line

1332
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,871
And I don't anticipate any of the years ahead will be a straight line either

1333
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
How much of your

1334
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Because of

1335
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,039
Intelligence and how much do you think

1336
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,951
I probably give it 60% luck

1337
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
First job

1338
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,023
I do feel like

1339
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Circumstances

1340
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Play a big role

1341
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Obviously I worked hard to

1342
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,959
Be able to understand technology in

1343
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,263
You have to look at the timing of

1344
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
The fact that

1345
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
I John PayPal PayPal

1346
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,127
Success that entire group of people

1347
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,967
What started dumped out back in the Silicon Valley all with capital

1348
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
At a moment.

1349
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
Are people

1350
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
Weren't really focused on building new internet companies that sell you had all these confident technologist for PayPal all working on new intern

1351
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,231
Ideas with capital at a time where

1352
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:00,351
Sound wide open that's lucky my view but

1353
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:05,471
If you're unprepared for that you can miss out obviously so there is a preparation aspect but you have to

1354
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:11,871
Definitely pay attention to the luck to in and now it's not just all you

1355

Hey thanks for sticking around because

1388
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
Timeout for how you built

1389
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,975
And for a few moments I want you to imagine the secret life

1390
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:07,071
Outdoor cat to an outdoor cat is not being fed by

1391
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Human

1392
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,423
They will spend 80% of their waking hours hunting for food

1393
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
This is veterinarian Liz Bales where they hunt then play with their prey and then eat that small meal

1394
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,895
Small meal is probably a mouse

1395
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
And if your cat

1396
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,223
Just roaming around in the wild

1397
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
I need several mice a day

1398
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
What are cats

1399
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:35,231
Tell wake you up at four 5 or 6 in the morning to be fed they gobble up their food and vomit

1400
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,327
They can be aggressive or destructive

1401
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
All of this is

1402
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:46,751
Is because indoor cats get stressed out when they can't hunt and kill their food so even if your cat is never

1403
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
Lived outside Mother Nature has ingrained that

1404
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,639
Predatory behavior that need Intuit

1405
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Wants to recreate

1406
00:57:54,943 --> 00:58:01,087
Okay but how how do you recreate the hunting experience and say your one bedroom apartment with a totally Spies

1407
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Spoiled indoor cat

1408
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:08,767
Will the answer to that question just cut cancel is a few years ago when she was driving home from a Veterinary conference

1409
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,631
I mean it was pretty instantaneous from the time I drove home I drew it

1410
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
I mean 5 minutes

1411
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
And what she Drew

1412
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Was mice

1413
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
Five little mice

1414
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,615
That had a fabric exterior so the cat could use

1415
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
There

1416
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:30,783
Teeth and claws in the in the play part of it if they wanted to an inside would be that little mouse

1417
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
Size portion of food it's really only

1418
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
30 or 35 calories

1419
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,695
Her portion of food that a cat needs at a time

1420
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,279
But the important thing is you wouldn't just plant these mice down with a cats

1421
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Football supposed

1422
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,911
You would hide them in different parts of the house and then they really start

1423
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,311
Hunting and they said maybe we'll get down or not praying position with her their front feet are lower than their butt and

1424
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,359
Go running around looking for it's really fun

1425
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,407
Anyway at this point came all of the

1426
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
Typical stops

1427
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,783
The entrepreneurial Journey so the very next day I'm walking past like 8

1428
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:09,183
Totally chance meeting at a neighbor's house with the most perfect person you could imagine he said

1429
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,999
I'm an inventor and a medical device manufacturer

1430
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,303
And I said well you need to sit down

1431
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Partners worked on the 1st

1432
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:23,007
Zayn and my partner Sue and I so did ourselves in her kitchen with her mother's sewing

1433
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
Prototypes I would go to my

1434
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:32,991
My colleagues at work and say hey take this one home see what your cat thinks of it and so we had end-of-course raise some money

1435
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
$136,000 to be exact

1436
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:42,719
Day 4 of Kickstarter when we met our goal and we all were on the phone together when we hit the number and that was

1437
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:47,583
Super fun and then she went to a big industry conference and got a lot of Buzz it's the largest

1438
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,423
Pet product convention in America and they have a new product

1439
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:56,799
Category and gosh darn it we won the course during this whole happy-sounding journey

1440
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
Which was also experiencing a ton of stress and sleepless nights

1441
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
Is issues as always

1442
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
Was money money goes lightning fast

1443
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,415
Each spend for the website for the packaging for a designer

1444
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
Is it a good spend are we doing the right thing and I where am I going to get more money from and it's a lot of worry

1445
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,119
But things have now kind of settle down for less

1446
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,935
Since launching the cat feeder in 2016

1447
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:29,311
She's gotten it on to Amazon and chewy.com and into small pet stores across the country

1448
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
And she just partnered with a pet supplies

1449
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,431
Distributor that's working to get her product overseas

1450
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:38,015
And all that is great but Liz actually has bigger ambitions

1451
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,599
She wants to completely change the way our cats eat

1452
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
1 plastic Mouse

1453
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,999
