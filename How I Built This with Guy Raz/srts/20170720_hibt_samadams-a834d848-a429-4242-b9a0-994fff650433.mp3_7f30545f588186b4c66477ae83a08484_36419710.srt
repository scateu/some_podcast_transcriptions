00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Today's episode is a repeat but it's

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,336
One of my favorites and just a heads up to let you know that there's a little bit of strong language

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
In about the first minute and a half of the show so

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
If you got the kids register

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
Cover their ears for Amendment and 1/2 in the

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Can you get to go

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
So you called your dad like that guess what I'm drawing the family business

22
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
Make beer with Sky was worse I went home

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Really when I told him I was kind of hoping that he put his arm around me and

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Cuz this 150 year old family tradition was going to be carried on no

25
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
You looked at me sit gym you've done some really stupid things in your life this is this

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Stupidest from NPR

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movements they go

28
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
Today Show

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,664
Jim Cook started Brewing an old family beer recipe called at Samuel Adams bottle it up

30
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
And then helped kick-start the

31
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Craft beer movement

32
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
In America

33
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
At some point last year the number of breweries America

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Cast the 5000 mark

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Most of us breweries make

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Craft beer

37
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Ipas

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
Porter Stout sloggers

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
This is

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
Beer that wins Awards all over the world

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
And a lot of it even gets exported

42
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Places like Germany in Holland

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Belgium

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
Beer brewing is practically a religion

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
But if somehow you win

46
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
Back in time to like 1980

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
And someone handed you a cold bottle of American Beer

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
You might not recognize it

49
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Because

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Monty Python fans might remember this

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
American Beer used to be a joke

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
It's it's

53
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
So that was what it was like when Jim Cook was a young man but he knew a lot about beer because he had

54
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Happened to come from a family of beer makers

55
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
My dad was a broom

56
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Master and

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
It's like being a chef

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
In the kitchen he was responsible for

59
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
The recipe and the quality

60
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Of

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
The berry wasn't the owner

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
So

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
He got out of brewmaster

64
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
School in 9th

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
1948

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
There were a thousand breweries all over the US

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
36 years later when I started Sam Adams 1000

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Add window down to 50

69
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
And my dad

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Bad

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
To move

72
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Brewery to brewery as

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Vista breweries close

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Did you have any

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Intention like as a kid or as a

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Latino

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
I like doing this doing the same thing your dad did

78
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
No my dad

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
Told me that it was a miserable way to make a living

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
And he eventually left

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
The brewing in Des

82
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Entirely

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
The last thing that he wanted for me to do

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Who was to go

85
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Back

86
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Indie Brewing

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Little bit

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
Crazy cuz if they were like it wasn't your dad was a brewer like

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
His dad was a pervert

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Every oldest son for 6th generation

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Has been

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
A brewer

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
I believe I'm the only

94
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
6th generation

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Brewer in the United States

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
So what did you want to

97
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Actually I really didn't know

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
You know I had this wonderful education

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Oportun

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
That nobody in my family

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Had ever had

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
Maybe after I graduated

103
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
From

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
College I started a JD MBA

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
And I could just feel this

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
Pressure behind me pushing me

107
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Towards

108
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Some career decision

109
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
So I dropped out

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
So what would you do that well

111
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
At the time I was involved in a

112
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Lot of outdoor activities

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
Rock climbing kayaking

114
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Backpack

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Things like that

116
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
My climbing

117
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Partner

118
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
He got me involved

119
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
In

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Outward Bound

121
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
I was able to do that

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
During the summer

123
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
And then

124
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Hyatt

125
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
I learned

126
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
That

127
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
You don't need

128
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
That much to live on

129
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
If you're really enjoying what you're doing

130
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
End

131
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
So how many years did

132
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Did you do that for

133
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,831
I did it on and off for three and a half

134
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
At the end of that three and a half years I thought

135
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Okay

136
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
I think I'm ready to go back

137
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
And got my

138
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
MBA in my JD

139
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
And

140
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Dave started a

141
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Working as management

142
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Consultant for

143
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
A company called Boston

144
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Consulting Group

145
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
And we flew first class you know you

146
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Consulted with CEOs and May

147
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
They treated you really well

148
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
It was great job

149
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
For a while

150
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
Gas sounds pretty good so why did you leave that

151
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Had this

152
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Epiphany I guess

153
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
After 6 years

154
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Bcgi

155
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Ask myself

156
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Do I want to do this.

157
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
And the answer came back

158
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
No

159
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
The next to the corollary to that was with

160
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
I don't do it for the rest of my life

161
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
I probably don't want to do it

162
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Tomorrow

163
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
So how did that

164
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Like that decision

165
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Lead to Haiti youth

166
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Think you have beer

167
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
That's a good question then

168
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
I knew I didn't want to work in the corporate

169
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
So I thought I'm going to start my own business I don't know what it's going to be

170
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
I'm fat

171
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
My dad had given me

172
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Actually copy of Inc magazine

173
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
And there was an article in there

174
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
About Anchorage

175
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Is this

176
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
Small Brewing California it was owned by

177
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Great guy named Fritz Maytag

178
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
And

179
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Fritz

180
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Had a viable

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Small

182
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Brewery

183
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
It was an outlier

184
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
When I was

185
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
A consultant

186
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
What always fascinated me for the outliers

187
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Because that's where the real learning was

188
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
There was obviously the pit

189
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Potential to find a market

190
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
For a really high-quality beer

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
I started this

192
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Think about it and

193
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
I

194
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Developed a different

195
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Business model

196
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
For what is now called

197
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Craft brewing

198
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
So this is in the mid-eighties

199
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
1984

200
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
So you

201
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,087
You called your dad like that guess what I'm joining the family business I'm going to make beer with Sky was worse I went home

202
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
And and was he excited

203
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Not really

204
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
When I told him

205
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
I was kind of hoping that he

206
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Put his arm around me and

207
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Cuz this

208
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
150 year old family tradition was going to be

209
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,799
Carried on to yet another generation know he looked at me sit

210
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Jim you've done some really stupid things in your life this is the stupidest

211
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,903
Pause for second and ask you cuz I can tell

212
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
You have this great job

213
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
And you just left

214
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Yes

215
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
And I left it

216
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Because

217
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
Staying there was very

218
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Risky

219
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Leaving it was not

220
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Risky

221
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
And it's the difference in life

222
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Between things that are

223
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Scary

224
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
And things that are danger

225
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
And there are plenty of things that are scary but aren't Danger

226
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
And there are things that are dangerous

227
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
But not

228
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Scary

229
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Yeah and

230
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Those are the things that get you

231
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
I can give you a climbing analogy

232
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
From Outward Bound like

233
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
1 things we

234
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Top people do Wiz

235
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Rappel off a cliff

236
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
And it really it's a very scary

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Thanks

238
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
To do but

239
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
You're also

240
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Held

241
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Bye

242
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
A

243
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Belay rope

244
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
And that rope will hold

245
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Har

246
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
So walking off the cliff backwards

247
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Scary

248
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
But not dangerous

249
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Yeah okay

250
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Walking

251
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Across

252
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
You know what

253
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
35

254
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,647
Degree angle snowfield on a beautiful

255
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
You know late

256
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Mets

257
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
Afternoon with us

258
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Bright blue

259
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Sky

260
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
Not scary at all but it's very Danger

261
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Because

262
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Snow is melting

263
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Adventure is going to find a layer of ice

264
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
The water will lubricate that and you have an Avalon

265
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,151
That is dangerous but not scary

266
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
In my situation

267
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Staying at BCG

268
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Was

269
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Dangerous but not scary in the

270
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
The danger there the risk

271
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Of it was

272
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
Continuing to do something that didn't make me happy

273
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
And getting to

274
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Yo 65 and looking back and go oh my God I wasted my life

275
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,031
That is risk that is danger

276
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Sedative without you set your dad I mean did you convince him that this was

277
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Worth trying

278
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
He eventually did

279
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Come around

280
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
You know I sat down with him

281
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
The thing that

282
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Convinced him

283
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
I think because

284
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
All the American Brewers were basically making the same kind of

285
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
Yeah you know very light

286
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Very easy to drink

287
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
And

288
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
I'm not going to compete

289
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
With bud and Miller and Coors

290
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Everybody in the US who wants

291
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Good beer is drinking the Imports

292
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
So is that that time it was like

293
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Heineken Heineken bag

294
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
St paulie girl

295
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Those were considered

296
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
The great beers of the world

297
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
And what I did know from my Brewing background is

298
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
We're not the great beers

299
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
The world

300
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
The Dare

301
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Was

302
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Possibility

303
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Love making

304
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Beer with a lot of flavor

305
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
The balance

306
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
And there's a

307
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Particular flavor structure of good beer

308
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
When you taste it

309
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
You will get that structure

310
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
And

311
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
I could give it to people fresh because beer is Parish

312
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:01,503
Beer has about a four to five months shelf life and the imported beers were almost always

313
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Stale they were typically in green and

314
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Beer bottles

315
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
And

316
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Visible light

317
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
Isomerize is a compound in Hobbs

318
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
That's why you get skunky beer

319
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
You come up with

320
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
With the recipe

321
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Be that in

322
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
You know you thought okay this is going to re-educate American Beer Drinker

323
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Why drink this beer instead of what they're used to

324
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
That was easy

325
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
After about an hour and a half when I dad was beginning to get it

326
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Oh and you know you're right

327
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Nobody's making great beer

328
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah maybe somebody should do that

329
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Then

330
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
You took me up into the attic and there was

331
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
Trunk and there were family recipe

332
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
Pieczenie took out one of the recipes

333
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
And said this is the recipe

334
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
It was for my great-great-grandfather's Brewery

335
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
My dad

336
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Handmade

337
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
A version of this beer

338
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
At

339
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
Wooden shoe bar in Minster Ohio where he was brewmaster

340
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Because the brewery was kind of going down the tubes

341
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,711
Any thought maybe we can turn the brewery around by making big

342
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
American lager

343
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
And the owner tasted it and

344
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Pull my Daisy Charlie

345
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
Nobody is going to drink huh

346
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
People want water

347
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
With foam on it

348
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
So make

349
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Water with foam on it

350
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
So you just took this recipe and and

351
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Start to experiment with

352
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Yams at the recipe I started making it in my kitchen

353
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Adam is sick

354
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Extremely difficult

355
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Typical beer to make

356
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
You can't really do this

357
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
This has a Homebrew

358
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
Yeah it requires

359
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Much more precise

360
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Control

361
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
I rooted and I could

362
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Patel

363
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
This is going to be a good beer if I can make this right

364
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
This would be

365
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
A really good beer

366
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
Okay so you make a beer but how did you

367
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Blake has even know how to

368
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
How to begin to

369
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Start a beer company

370
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Well

371
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
The first thing

372
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
I realized I had to find the best brewmaster

373
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
In America

374
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
To help me

375
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
I'm he was a man named dr. Joseph A weighty

376
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
And he was

377
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
The first

378
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
American Brewmaster to combine

379
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
High level

380
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
Scientific understanding

381
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Cuz he was a PhD

382
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Microbiology

383
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
With Decades of practical

384
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,231
Experience how did you even convince him to get involved in your life

385
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
Fly by Night startup you turn me down at first

386
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Here. This is

387
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Really crazy

388
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
You don't have enough money to pay me

389
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Yeah which was true

390
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Flexible

391
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Dr. Wade East

392
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
I'm not some

393
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
You know idiot kid

394
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Just making beer in their kitchen

395
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
My dad

396
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Was a brewmaster my grandfather and

397
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
He remembered my dad

398
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
A little bit I said well

399
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
I'll tell you what

400
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
I'll give you 2% of the company

401
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
And that

402
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Piqued his interest

403
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
He signed on

404
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,815
And he helped me adapt a 19th century recipe

405
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
20th century

406
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Brewery

407
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
So did you have to go out and raise money to

408
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Build-A-Bear

409
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Well

410
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
I realized

411
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Denver breweries out there

412
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
And my dad

413
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
He was the one who gave me this insight

414
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
What we did

415
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Is

416
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
We rented space

417
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Dr. Wade Easton I showed up

418
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Brewed beer

419
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
And

420
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Then they packaged it

421
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
And I

422
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,511
Didn't have to have my own Brewery for several years how when we started

423
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
We didn't have

424
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Things that you think you need for business

425
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
We didn't have an offer

426
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
We didn't have a telephone

427
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
Yeah I just asked myself

428
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
Am I spending money

429
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
On things

430
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
That are going to make

431
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,383
Beer batter or am I spending money on things just because that's what you

432
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
She supposed to spend it on

433
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
Did you come up with a name

434
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
A Santa Ana

435
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Well

436
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
It came for my history teacher

437
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
When I was a junior in high school. The revolution

438
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
She highlighted the role

439
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Of Samuel Adam

440
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Depending on what books you read he was a brewer

441
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
You know

442
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
I wanted

443
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
A name that was

444
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Assertively American

445
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
That reflected

446
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
America's

447
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,031
History and tradition etcetera etcetera

448
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
So on the label there it is

449
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Brewer Patriot

450
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
And I wanted

451
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
To do what Sam Adams it done

452
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,575
Only my little way I wanted to create a beer Revolution

453
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
And declare their independence

454
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
For the United States

455
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,679

It's how I built this from NPR

481
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
And I Rise

482
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463

Jim Cook

484
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Finally got it down to a

485
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Exactly the way

486
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
She wanted it

487
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
At this point

488
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
He had to figure out

489
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
How to sell it

490
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
So

491
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
My dad told me you know you can start Abyss

492
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
It's lonely

493
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
It's going to have its ups and downs

494
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
See if you can find a partner

495
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
So I looked around

496
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
BCG was

497
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Was folded like the best

498
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
In the brightest from the top business

499
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Schools

500
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Somehow

501
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
I couldn't

502
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
See

503
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
Them be my partner cuz they are all the same skills I had

504
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Yeah but then I

505
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Realize wait a minute there is a person

506
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Who

507
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Is

508
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Energetic

509
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Talented

510
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Resourceful

511
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Great people person

512
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Has all the skills that I don't really

513
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Have

514
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
She was

515
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
My second

516
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
So it was just

517
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Me

518
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
And Rhonda

519
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
She was

520
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
23 years old

521
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
No college degree

522
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
Bartended at night

523
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
We were the perfect complement

524
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
That attitude you guys convince

525
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Bars in

526
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
On shops

527
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
To take your beer

528
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Well

529
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
I was hoping

530
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Did I would get a distributor

531
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
Well they were five beer distributors in Boston and went to each one of them they all turned me down because

532
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Because

533
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
To them it looks like a stupid idea this was a beer that had a lot of color had a lot of flavor and

534
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,759
Taste this was in the Heyday of Light beer and you know they'd ask me okay

535
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,087
So what's your marketing plan to have a marketing plan

536
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
What's your advertising budget

537
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
I don't have any money for advertise

538
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Will tell me about the company

539
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,047
It's me and my 23 year-old ex-secretary

540
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,143
So wasn't very confident as a business

541
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
And the only way that I could

542
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
Get my beer

543
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Out there was

544
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
I would put cold beer in

545
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
My briefcase every morning I could fit seven beers

546
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Hannah Hindi

547
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
These two blue cool packs in a sleeve of cups

548
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
And

549
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
I went

550
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,647
From bar to bar cold calling just going walking in the managers and

551
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Yeah trying to get to him

552
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,511
I never sold anything in mind

553
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
What was that hard for you

554
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Yes

555
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
I was sure I remember to this

556
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
This day doing my first sale

557
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
And

558
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
Hit the streets in Boston I remember I was

559
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Okay

560
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm just going to call in the first bar

561
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
That I come to you

562
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
And I came to

563
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
A bar

564
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
I didn't know what I was doing and I had my

565
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Consulting Sudan

566
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,831
So I started talking to the guy behind the bar and he was nodding

567
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
I thought that's a good sign

568
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
But he wasn't saying anything

569
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Luckily

570
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,279
In the back was the manager cuz the guy I was talking to

571
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,863
Was what's called a barback the barback is the guy who likes

572
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Stocks the glasses and

573
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
That this guy didn't speak English

574
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
So

575
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
He was just nodding away

576
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Managing to the back thinking

577
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Oh my gosh

578
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Is the guy in a suit here he's talking to my barback

579
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
He's either IRS

580
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
Aries immigration and naturalization

581
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Action services

582
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
Eat neither one of those so he rushed up

583
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
And yeah I kind of had my 32nd drill

584
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Hi I'm Jim Cook

585
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
I'm starting a small Brewery

586
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Here in Boston

587
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
To make a new beer

588
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
I'm going to call it.

589
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
It's called Sam Adams

590
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
And

591
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
My real

592
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah end

593
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Point was to get them

594
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
To try the be

595
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
So

596
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
You know it

597
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
I build up to this

598
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Setting would you like to

599
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Try it out he said sure leave me a bottle

600
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Oh it's cold

601
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
I have some cups here

602
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Let me pour you one

603
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
Before he could say no and of course

604
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
In the bar business

605
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
If you pour beer I can't just throw it out

606
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Yeah

607
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
So

608
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
We tried it together

609
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
He said

610
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Kids

611
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
You know I didn't think the beer was going to be this good

612
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
I'll take it

613
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,471
And I was so excited and of course I went back and actually Rhonda was

614
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,567
Taking some time off before we start I called I was so excited Rhonda

615
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
We got our first customer

616
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Asbury practice

617
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
How many cases did he order

618
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
I forgot

619
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
So I had to go back the next day and apologized and I was

620
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Scared again

621
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
That he would have liked changed his mind or anyting but he gave me a 10 case order

622
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Services

623
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
Like 1985 and you launch and

624
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:38,432
You got to get some attention and your 6 weeks after Sam Adams came out yeah

625
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,016
It got picked as the best beer in America how did that happen

626
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
It happened out in Denver Colorado

627
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
It was at the

628
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
Great American Beer Festival Wichita

629
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
Pretty much beers from every Brewer

630
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
And

631
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Babe

632
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Went around over two nights

633
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Taste of the beers everybody got to vote for the best

634
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
And they did this countdown

635
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,288
You have 10 9 a.m. I thought we'd finish in the top 10

636
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,664
But they know they kept getting lower and lower

637
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Announce

638
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
You know

639
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Analyst

640
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,296
Number to the second best beer in America is

641
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Is this and it's like well

642
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Yeah maybe next year yeah

643
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
And then and the best beer in America is Samuel Adams Boston Lager

644
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
And the whole company was to

645
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Pikachu and Rhonda

646
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
Trip to do that mean you were profitable from from the

647
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
From the start

648
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Yes we were profitable from

649
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The first

650
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Full

651
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Month

652
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Because

653
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Going back to us talking about earlier

654
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
It was the ultimate lean

655
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Start up

656
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Like I said

657
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
We had no office

658
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
We didn't even have

659
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
Telephone we did all our business from Payphone

660
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah I knew where all the good payphones in Boston

661
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,744
We're the ones that were warm in the winter the ones where

662
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,072
He actually had a little shelf or you can put stuff on

663
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
So

664
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
That was very

665
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Clear when I started it

666
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
It's very clear to me that way

667
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
Only two things that we needed

668
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
To do

669
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Really well

670
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
We needed

671
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
To make

672
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Great beer

673
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Consistent

674
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
And we need

675
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Get to work our butts off

676
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
To sell it

677
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
And at the beginning this was like a a regional thing like

678
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
10 in Boston in

679
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
New England

680
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
So how did you get it to

681
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Spartacus

682
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
It happened very slowly

683
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
You know it

684
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Basically

685
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Started in Boston

686
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I sort of

687
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,192
Grew a little bit out of Boston and went to Worcester

688
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
I was doing a lot of the

689
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Selling myself

690
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
So

691
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
One bar

692
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
At a time

693
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
And a lot of work a lot of shoe leather

694
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
A lot of

695
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
Motel 6

696
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
So I can

697
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Bankatfirst

698
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
City out of

699
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,856
Add a New England was Washington so I would go down to Washington

700
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Down here

701
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
I still know a lot of the bar owners

702
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Here I sit at bar

703
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Before I came over here

704
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,400
The Irish Times yeah famous part one of my first

705
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Accounts

706
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
And

707
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Was talking to Brandon the current owner

708
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
But his dad

709
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
Put Sam Adams

710
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
In there

711
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Almost 30 years ago

712
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
So

713
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
You know it was very hard in the beginning getting

714
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Places to carry a

715
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Probably got

716
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
U95

717
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Percent rejection

718
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Can soy make 20 calls

719
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
To get one account

720
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
And

721
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Then we got picked as the best beer in America

722
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Yeah we got a bunch

723
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Publicity around

724
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
That People magazine to the story

725
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Which was good and bad

726
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Cuz

727
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
All that publicity booster

728
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
Did the sales and we ran out of beer

729
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:43,008
You could not make it fast will it take 6 weeks to make Sam Adams and we weren't expecting it

730
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
So you're out of beer for 3 weeks

731
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
We lost a bunch of a cat

732
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Piss people off

733
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
But it was clear there was

734
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,224
That this idea was a bigger idea than I

735
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Lights at this wasn't going to

736
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
Now Take 5 years to get to $1000000

737
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
That was five years ago

738
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
A million bucks it'll be great I'll be happy life yes exact

739
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
Anime

740
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
5 month

741
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
I remember

742
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Sitting at a bar with Rhonda

743
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
And running we had business plan

744
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,592
But something's telling me this is bigger than

745
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
We thought it was

746
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Going to be

747
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
That

748
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
We are climbing a mountain

749
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Here

750
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
And

751
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
Nobody climbs a mountain to get to the middle

752
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
We're going to climb this mountain to get to the top

753
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
And

754
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
It may take 30 years may take 50 years

755
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
Our mountain is

756
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
I want

757
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
Sam Adams to be

758
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
The largest and most respected of the high-end beers

759
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
In the United

760
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
That's our Mountain

761
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
Member

762
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Part of your strategy a team

763
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Was like attacking

764
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,416
Those imported beers and I remember hearing a radio as a

765
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
You do

766
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
In the 90s where you say

767
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Declare your Independence

768
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
From foreign beer

769
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
The radio spot came about because

770
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
Sabres radio station in Boston that want a beer for a party

771
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
And so we traded him beer

772
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Four air time

773
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Now

774
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
They gave us air time at 2 in the morning

775
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Thinking

776
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Who would want that

777
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Academy

778
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
I thought that was

779
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Great because

780
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
That's when

781
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
The servers and the bartenders

782
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,088
Get off the ship so they gave me

783
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
All this air time

784
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
And

785
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,232
At first was going to like get radio Talent

786
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,048
Tell record it and then I found out well

787
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
You can hire that but

788
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
Yeah there's all these Union rules and you have to pay residuals you got to

789
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Track it

790
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
I can't do that

791
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
I'll do the spots

792
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Myself

793
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
So

794
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
My spot was

795
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
When America asked

796
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
For Europe's tired and

797
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,992
We didn't mean there beer but the beer they send us

798
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Is hardly their best

799
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
They send us

800
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Heineken

801
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
Outlawed in Germany

802
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
Because of Germany's strict

803
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Beer Purity law

804
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
The backstage send us

805
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,560
Isn't the same backs they have in Germany

806
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
They had forbidden adyen

807
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Thanks to it

808
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
That

809
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Was about the company

810
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
Were you at threatened with the litigation oh yes

811
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
But I knew I was right

812
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,128
They're having a brewing background I knew it

813
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
You could also tell it on analysis so

814
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
My feelings always been

815
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,784
If you're right about something important

816
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,392
Push it

817
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
Tok so after I guess

818
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
About a decade

819
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
You launch you decide to go public

820
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
What happened

821
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
Why'd you decide to do that

822
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Well

823
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
I thought it was time

824
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
To do something to

825
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
Reward mine vest

826
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Just because at that time

827
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
I think a dollar

828
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Invested

829
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Was probably worth $400

830
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
So

831
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
I went to a couple in bed

832
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Banksy describe the IPO process

833
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
But when they describe it to you

834
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
You realize

835
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
That there's nothing public at all about it's all for their buddy and his all for their buddies at the bay

836
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
Institution

837
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
To buy the shares

838
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
And make a bunch of money and

839
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
That

840
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Bothered me and I

841
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
I thought I got to find a way around that

842
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
So I started thinking about it

843
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
And I came up

844
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Idea

845
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
So we put coupons on the six

846
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Pax

847
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
That allowed you

848
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
To buy

849
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
33 shares

850
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
Boston Beer Company

851
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
At $15 a share so was born at $95

852
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
You said to send in a check

853
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
And

854
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
The Investment Bank

855
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Freaked out about it

856
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,720
They told me you can't do it it'll never work they give me all these reason

857
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Not to but

858
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
I stood my ground

859
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
I was insistent and I knew that

860
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
The investment Banks Kitty make

861
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
So they will let me do it

862
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
If I refuse to compromise

863
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
My so I refuse to compromise

864
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Eventually they all came around and

865
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
We got a hundred and thirty some thousand

866
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
People who sent in their shells

867
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
We got six

868
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Define million dollar

869
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
That was the first time

870
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Something like that

871
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Had been done

872
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
And other people

873
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Have

874
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
Continue to do it followed up on it

875
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
So earlier you said that you want

876
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Salmon recipes

877
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Largest and most

878
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Affected

879
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
Of the cortical high-end beers in the US

880
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Do you think you would cheat

881
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
This may sound

882
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Surprising but

883
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
I still don't feel like we're there and

884
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
Yeah but I got to give you some perspective what do you think our market share in the United

885
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
Penn 15% yeah that's what everybody thinks

886
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
A little over 1%

887
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
So the big Brewers

888
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Fillmore beer

889
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Then I make all your right

890
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,560
Yeah 90% of the US Beer Market is in the hands of

891
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
2

892
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Big

893
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Global

894
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Brewing conglomerate

895
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Small company

896
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
How many points do you guys have now

897
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
I'm we've got a little over 1400 people

898
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
That's

899
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
To me also

900
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Really

901
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,944
Gratifying because

902
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
The average

903
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
W2 compensation

904
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
$70,000

905
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
So there

906
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
You know they are good jobs

907
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
Atterbury those are Manufacturing

908
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Good paying manufacturing jobs

909
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
In communities

910
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,072
All across the United States

911
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
When you stink

912
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
About

913
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
How you built the company

914
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
And Sam Adams

915
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
How much of a do you think was

916
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
You're skilled in your

917
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Intelligence

918
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
And talent and how much of it was

919
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Guy

920
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
I'll take the lock

921
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
So

922
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
In all humility a lot of it

923
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,392
Looks like I look back and think I could have gone wrong you know the

924
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Brew Kettle could have exploded

925
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Or

926
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Yeah that first guy could have told me

927
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Is a really stupid idea go back to your

928
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Job

929
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
You know a lot of things

930
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Didn't go wrong that they could have

931
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
Did you could you have ever imagined that

932
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Craft beer in America

933
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Would become what it was

934
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
I

935
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Never

936
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Imagine

937
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504

And I never

941
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
Imagine that there would be

942
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
45

943
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
100

944

Their own

948
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Success

949
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Today

950
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
American Beer

951
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Has gone from the laughing stock that it was

952
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
When I started

953
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
2

954
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
The best place in the world

955
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
How to get Beer Drinker

956
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
And when the rest of the world

957
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
They're looking at the US

958
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,088
I wish we could do in our country what Americans have done with beer I wish we had the beer culture

959
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
That America has

960
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Yunnan

961
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Makes me feel good

962
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Every time I have a beer

963
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048

00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:27,136

And November

984
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
My name is Caitlin watch until I'm in Los Angeles California

985
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,928
Which went to college in La she didn't notice it there all these juice bars everywhere and whatever friends

986
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Peta Juicery home

987
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,024
Siri put this carrot in the juicer

988
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
And outcomes bike

989
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,728
Tiny tiny amount of liquid and I see these nouns of vibrant carrot pulp you know what

990
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Smells so good it's so fresh

991
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,896
And she just looked at me because I usually throw away the pulp I have no idea what to do with it

992
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,712
Is how Caitlin came up with an idea for a business

993
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,576
The next day I was like wow like what if this juice pulp could be used to create

994
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,208
Healthy snacks at a more affordable price point until I called him a bunch of juiceries right then and there

995
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,864
And I asked him what are you doing with your juice pulp so she's got to give her there

996
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,984
Fruit and veggie pulp

997
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
Into snacks next like

998
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:24,128
Granola have five different flavors so apple pie peanut butter and carrot

999
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,712
Red velvet red velvet

1000
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,088
Hope pantry and it's still the small batch operation just a few hundred bags of snacks a week

1001
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,744
Italy selling at health food stores in La and online obsession

1002
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Kind of pathetic

1003
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
You know seeing these bins taupe and being so happy just to see it process until like a better product invented

1004
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,776
ABC sold on the shelves I just think that's the craziest thing so I love it yeah

1005
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:58,176
Back when we first talked with Caitlin in the fall she was applying to an incubator program run by Chobani

1006
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Yogurt

1007
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
She made the first cut and in about a week

1008
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
She'll find out whether she's in for real

1009
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,648
And if she is she'll travel to New York

1010
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:13,792
And then Idaho to learn how to Bonnie does business and maybe she'll get the answer to a question

1011
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
She's still trying to figure out

1012
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
How do we get

1013
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008
These products are usually premium price you know vegetable infused I'm healthy grain free

1014
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Max and

1015
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,384
Make it actually really accessible for people through the use of neglected resources like juice pulp

1016
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
So just that opportunity to be able to kind of work with a company that

1017
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,552
In that same mindset is it would be amazing

1018
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,880
Kaitlyn's business has also grown from just one person

1019
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
25 part-time volunteers

1020
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
Including a pastry chef and a strategy expert from Google all of a sudden all these people came into my life

1021
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
And we're super passionate about it and excited and

1022
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,312

1023
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,944
Excited because I'm like okay we're ready to go you know it's keeping me going right now Kaelyn is making a profit just yet

1024
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016

1025
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
