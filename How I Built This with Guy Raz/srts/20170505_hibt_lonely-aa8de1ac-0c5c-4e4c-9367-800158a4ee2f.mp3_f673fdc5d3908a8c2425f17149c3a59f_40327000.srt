It grown so fast

69
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,328
We had television going we had started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of stuff

70
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,192
When 9/11 happened

71
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
People stop traveling on travel guides then just stopped

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
Did you think that there was a

73
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
Possibilities

74
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
We just have to let people go

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
We just have to come back the number books

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024

81
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
And the movements

82
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
Backpack along the Asia hippie Trail in the 70s

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
And turn them into the

84
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Biggest travel guide company

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
In the world

86
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
So much of how a company comes together

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Happens

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
By chance

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
I mean

90
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,376
Sergey Brin and Larry Page never met

91
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Would there be Google

92
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:56,032
If Kate and Andy Spade never worked in the same clothing store in Tucson Arizona

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Kate Spade bags of Heaven

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
Same thing for Airbnb your Instagram or Warby Parker

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
They all happened because

96
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
A moment in time that

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Could have passed

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
Which is a story of Lonely Planet guide books

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,000
Because it all started on a bench in Regent's Park in London on a knife

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
October afternoon in 1970

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Marie wheeler was

102
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Looking for a

103
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Quiet place to sit

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
And as I was walking around the park

105
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
It was only one bed

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Will try several times because on the bench was also a young man and I thought if I sit in that but then she's probably going to try and pick me up

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
And I really don't feel like that

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
This is 1970 I can sit wherever I want so I sat in the sunny bench

109
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
I'm trying my best

110
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
To be a man and started reading my book

111
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
It's a polling now.

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Magazine

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
New edition of it and I was just reading that

114
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
What are you doing

115
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
Hide I said it's 10 place to read on a Thursday afternoon

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Hand shear

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
Reply positively

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Get lost and then then

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
He's got my sauce and I liked it

120
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
So I said

121
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
I don't know I have a big head that

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
We started chatting and

123
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
After a while Tony ask Maureen if

124
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
She want to go see a movie

125
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
They went and I'm on the way home and got lost

126
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
We wandered around

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
For quite a while

128
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Before I realized

129
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
He was lost because

130
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Just sent over the confidently in

131
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Keeps going thinking he's going about

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
And the thing is that sting or

133
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Anyway that first date

134
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Led to a

135
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
A second and then to

136
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
3rd and then

137
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,511
12 months to the day later we got married and has proposed

138
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
Silva's very precise we was was May

139
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Inmate

140
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,447
And he said I would have known you a year on October 7th

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
I need to get married and I

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
You don't get married

143
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Because you've known each other for a year

144
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
And she said no

145
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
But we would save tax

146
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
The Business Schools

147
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
Excuse for that I'm afraid it wasn't the most romantic

148
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,463
So once you got married did what did you think you would just start get jobs in London and start your life

149
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
That was pretty much the plan that

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
We met just at the start of my two-year course and London and

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
We got married halfway through that 2 years

152
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,311
But time sometime in that second year together we decided we were going to take a year off

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Go traveling and that's certainly

154
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Change things

155
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
How did you guys

156
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Make that two

157
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
What was the converse

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
Don't know if it was very much a thing to do with that are there

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Later on they started calling it

160
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Happy trail

161
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
And we we just coated the Asia Overland trip that you

162
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
You left London and you headed east

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
But this was the air right now the music of the time was

164
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
Riding the Marrakesh Express Wilma

165
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,799
The Beatles were off in India so that was a lot of sort of cultural significance to it

166
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
But we joined what became known as the hippie trial and we

167
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Headed east

168
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
So this is I guess around

169
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
70

170
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
2 ish

171
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
In what was the

172
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
And the plan was to

173
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Drive from

174
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
London

175
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,023
This car breaks down will

176
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Get out of it and leave it by the road

177
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,167
We were going to go as far east as we could go have to dispose

178
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,519
It would break down would sell it one of the other

179
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Start driving

180
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
To Europe and then

181
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
And then what

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,735
You just keep driving you going to the Border

183
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
The turkey in around and you go right across the road and then you go right across

184
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
Afghanistan annies

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,255
You just keep going for Pakistan and then you go through India and then you couldn't get across yet the flag cross Brahma

186
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
And then we just carry on the plan was

187
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
We get to Australia

188
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
And then we would stay in Australia and work for a while

189
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
I would save up enough money and would fly back to London and that was

190
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
That was the plan

191
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
We had so little money we left London with 400 lb

192
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
So that was our money and

193
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
You just stayed

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Slept in the van

195
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
We did a x but generally we can

196
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Most of the time across Asia in 2 weeks

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
How to use in Afghanistan

198
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,207
In Afghanistan you know a lot of the hotels in those days

199
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
Debbie and Gardens when you could camp in the god

200
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
How did you even know

201
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Where to go in

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
And what to do in

203
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
And how to

204
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Get the right bus I mean how did you

205
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Figure all that

206
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
I mean if you walk into a bus

207
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
Stationed in Afghanistan and you're kind of pointing towards the Border

208
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
Somebody will put you on the right bus

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
You know if you're wondering gonna straight with a bag and you're looking to look at you look like you look your loss

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Some of the hotel or you'll see something that looks like a hotel

211
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
It's easy

212
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
Because you just pull out your Lonely Planet

213
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,311
1972

214
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,223
Really immature you know you manage and actually you know what was right is that you can travel for weeks with that

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Sing another Western

216
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,343
But then suddenly apollon summer like Kabul or somewhere that you know

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,231
Are Harry and the others and you just spent an afternoon just trading information

218
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,607
You know when you get here this place is good this place isn't you'd swap information that way

219
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Pacific old fashioned communication

220
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
And what look all along you are keeping a journal Tony or both you guys are

221
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
I did keep a diary I've always been

222
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,151
Reasonably assiduous about documenting things and

223
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
Keeping records of things

224
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,807
Where we stayed and what it cost and

225
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
How many miles to Carthage

226
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,999
And they did I know I think about the Palaces in the walls in the Fortress

227
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,839
This is important but those days it was very much

228
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
The information which is a good thing

229
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Later on selling

230
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
And doing all this would like

231
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
The no money right

232
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
We have to do everything is cheap

233
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
If possible so it was third-class Trail and it was hitchhiking

234
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
We hitchhike from

235
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Bangkok to Singapore

236
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
To get down there and then we went across

237
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
By boat to Jakarta and then we went by bus

238
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Diwali and then

239
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,767
In Vale we were really run out of lock the airline that was supposed to that we were supposed to have tickets on to take us

240
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Australia

241
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Broke down

242
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
And didn't have any more

243
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Planes

244
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
I'm so

245
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
We met this New Zealander who had little Yalta and he was looking for crew

246
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,591
To get done to Australia so we got on his yacht and crew

247
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Australia

248
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Like a scary at all

249
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
The only time I think I go

250
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
I got really we had a huge storm in the boat

251
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,135
And if I had to have more sensitive being terrified but they're so busy hang onto the boat

252
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
And then the thing thing

253
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Australia and I remember

254
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Standing on the out looking at this

255
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Coastline

256
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Nothing

257
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Nothing at all

258
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Bicep

259
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Miles

260
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
From anywhere on there was nothing there snakes

261
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
Spiders I don't even know if I have no idea

262
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
What are you doing

263
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
What did you think you would do that

264
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
Did you think you would hang out there for a while because that

265
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Connections in

266
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Australia right

267
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
No

268
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
We went to Sydney Festival I mean if you're going to go to Australia

269
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
Sydney's the Golden City that you you will head towards sleep

270
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
The yellow brick road leads to

271
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,119
Azure crossing the Sydney bridge on our last ride and I said and done it was not long after Christmas so

272
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Quite close

273
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Holidays

274
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
I said to Tony how much money have we got

275
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Left

276
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,127
$0.27 in English money

277
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
So what did you do

278
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,623
I had a camera so we we went to the area or sitting

279
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
Dispose of dinosaur things at 11 Shopkins on

280
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
We got $25 for my camera

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
I pulled back a week later

282
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
In those days you can get a room for a week for $15 so we

283
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Single beds

284
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
Who's romantic married almost 2 years

285
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
You're the best

286
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
That afternoon instantly

287
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Kind of

288
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,815
Corner shelf but they did sandwiches and things at the end of the day they let me take the sandwiches home that were left

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
So we ate

290
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,447
And I worked there for a little while until we and then we both keynote but good job

291
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
One year trip and not become a three-year trip

292
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
So what did you

293
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
What kind of job did

294
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
I got a marketing job for a thumb typical company

295
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
Maureen you're working a job another

296
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
What was job you're doing

297
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
I was a PA in a wine company so you're working for a wine cup

298
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
How do you get to a point where you

299
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
You

300
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Start selling a travel book

301
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Tony Tony has all the great idea

302
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
It's like it's from around the world let's go guide books I mean

303
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
I will say Tony is the architect in on the carpenter

304
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,103
This was off to read we met so many people that every time you went to some sort of

305
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Party on

306
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
Met friends restaurants in Saint always someone would ask us

307
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
Where did you go how did you do this that was a lot of interest

308
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Minnesota trip we did

309
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
Wake up telling them in writing things down and

310
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
Will actually information.

311
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
Able to get my typewriter and bring it home at night and

312
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,847
I've already Guillotine when we were trimming all the books and I'm on one of those massive Cypress to be stapled together

313
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,967
So in a way are we kind of the arrival to get enough equipment to do this

314
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,879
Printed but it was it was a very basic little boy that was a very it was actually done already was done on our kitchen table

315
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Because actually we only had two kitchen

316
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,511
In the bedroom

317
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
We found a big commercial printer

318
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Gaia hypothesis

319
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Prince and Me

320
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Basement under his apartment

321
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
And he printed them for us

322
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,711
Folded them and put them together and stapled

323
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
Facebook

324
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
When did they were finished and done we had them in boxes at our apartment

325
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,951
I took a day off where can I buy went straight to the Bookshelf that it said that

326
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
Buy 50 copies of it and said okay here I am

327
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Write me the order

328
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Phantom

329
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
You know I attended the day I sold a surprising number I was sending

330
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
What was the price

331
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
Tolerating 96 pages that sold for $1 AT&T cover

332
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
All the country

333
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,015
Old is old major in 96

334
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
We got her big break

335
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Bookshop and she said

336
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
You want to buy this book and she said

337
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
To accompany us and I said Lonely Planet

338
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
She said I've never heard of them

339
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
And I showed her the book and she said off

340
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
What's your telephone number in case

341
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
I want to

342
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Get my books that we didn't have a telephone

343
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
So I had to give him

344
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Work number

345
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
She called me and she said

346
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
My flatmate is a journalist

347
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
She wants to interview you and your house

348
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Husband on television

349
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
So we went on television to talk about our trip and doing this book

350
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
That was our first big publicity thing wasn't it

351
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah I was I was waiting for your first guidebook the pamphlet

352
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Anime

353
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
There's some pretty different things in their right like I mean like it tells you where you can find marijuana

354
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,935
Where to get a fake ID and stuff like that

355
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
I have to assume that you

356
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
You know you guys

357
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Could not have been

358
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Stone hippies

359
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,039
Because you were pretty motivated to write everyday and to go places

360
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,391
We were actually really boring we didn't do a lot of that

361
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Occasionally

362
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
But very rarely

363
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
Years later Lino's Lonely Planet

364
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Became

365
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Only skate

366
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
People who wrote using any kind of known and what they were really

367
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
Who people use.

368
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
Antonio and I would be at the

369
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
The cafe in all the cool people

370
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Just didn't look

371
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Cool and yet we were the ones who

372
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Interesting

373
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,623
How did you come up with with the name Lonely Planet

374
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
There's a story behind that we

375
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,047
You never had we had everything we had a title for is it was across Asia

376
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,911
On the cheap

377
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
I'm weeping out to the restaurant and drinking too much red wine

378
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
How many just mean to say that a rock and roll band on the

379
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
Roadkill Mad Dogs and Englishmen

380
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Joe Cocker and Leon Russell

381
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
Traveling around the US in the late 60s great film

382
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,855
I'm one of the songs in that that that movie in that that help MS

383
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
Joe Cocker singing a song called space captain

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
On the first line of the song goes

385
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
Once while traveling across the sky

386
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
This Lonely Planet put my eye

387
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Humming the song

388
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Peanut Sunrise what do we call the company Lonely Planet

389
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Twitch Maureen said

390
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Actually

391
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
First line is lovely planet and I wish you would stay

392
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,367
And he said bologna can't even better and I said how he said

393
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
It's a Great Dane

394
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
As well you know we're learning to live together on this planet

395
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Soaked to the first book

396
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Like make any money

397
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Didn't lose money on its but it wasn't that

398
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
A real money making proposition

399
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Better run that time when we were thinking of that okay

400
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
This is when we quit and head back to Europe

401
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,951
I'm done with my kind of thinking has sold surprisingly well

402
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
Maybe we should do another book

403
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
And what we thought was

404
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
Towards the end of the trip from London

405
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
With come down through Southeast Asia

406
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,983
Articles about time the Vietnam War was still winding down so

407
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
Southeast Asia wasn't seen as a

408
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
No hotspot for a

409
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Holiday

410
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
It was able to place next to a war zone

411
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
But we could see that was about to change we saw it okay

412
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
What we'll do is we'll travel around

413
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Southeast Asia

414
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
I will write the best book anybody has ever seen on Southeast Asia

415
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
We had a Yamaha

416
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Trail bike

417
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
That was our kinds

418
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
And at this point Tony did you think this is

419
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
No I still think you know we would we realize we took we kind of sweet spot we found we were doing something that

420
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
People really liked

421
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,663
One of the things I've said a lot over the years is it it wasn't like you

422
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Dot-com more

423
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
You know social media set up these days they start them one day and

424
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
A week later they worth a billion dollars

425
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
That was industrial weed

426
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
A business proved very slowly and I think it was

427
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
It was more like a snowboard

428
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Rolling down hill

429
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
You got to keep pushing it at first and then it starts to develop momentum and starts the

430
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
Get larger as it rolls down the hill

431
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,639
When we come back at Tony and Maureen grew Lonely Planet

432
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
And then shrink it

433
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Almost

434
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223

00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,664
Tony and Maureen were traveling around southeast Asia once again

471
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
And they're doing research for their second

472
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Lonely Planet book

473
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
When it was just about finished I had a dummy of the book

474
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
That was one big book shop in Singapore

475
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Geico

What was your name

491
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
And we did another one

492
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
Another one another one

493
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
People started coming to us with ideas for other books

494
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
Good morning did you think I mean so so by the mid-70s

495
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Or late seventies

496
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
Did you still did you

497
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
You think that this

00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
She's going to be

499
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
You're working me did you do

Could you both

501
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
Focus full time on this thing now

502
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Pretty much

503
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Although I was at Universal

504
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,256
But you know if I have plenty of time left

505
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:02,656
The funniest try not to travel first year though

506
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Sitting on you Maureen salary while I worked on the books

507
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
I didn't think it was going to

508
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
They are life

509
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
It was still Tony and I

510
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Living in a little rented house

511
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,248
With a pile of boxes boxes everywhere full of books

512
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Address them with put them in the back of the

513
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
The car and take them to the post office I mean you don't really see

514
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:31,328
Multinational conglomerate

515
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,680
Fox to pick the books out when they came in from the printer and then sending them out again you know

516
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
It still felt very much like a cottage industry

517
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
And it wasn't like you went out and raised

518
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Any money you were just until they would give us any money

519
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,712
Yeah basically know if you told a bank and what we were doing books on that site

520
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Get a life

521
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,624
We didn't have any money and we weren't making a lot of money

522
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
To keep on doing books

523
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
But we did find other paperwork coming to us know that used up book and that's a

524
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
You know I really liked your book traveling around Southeast Asia

525
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
I've been living in South America or you know I could

526
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Write a book about this place of that place so we

527
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
We started getting other people coming to us with similar ideas

528
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,616
I'm ready by the end of the 70s bad about 20 books

00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,032
Honda suddenly we had this book that was over 700 pages and

552
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
It's sold for

553
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,896
Yeah double-figures it was $12 or $14 or something instead of

554
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
304

555
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
I need your soul

556
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
It's always on a hundred thousand copies

557
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
Wow it was the first

558
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
All India book

559
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,904
Guy that told you everything

560
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,512
It wasn't like that but it was all of that huge interest in India at the

561
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
What time Minnesota

562
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
The company

563
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
Double DIN size of an item week

564
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
Suddenly started taking on more ride tourism

565
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Looking at other big projects

566
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
So what did you do I mean how did you

567
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
Eight month old daughter what happened with us

568
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
And every

569
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
School holiday

570
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Ridgewood

571
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
Just go left

572
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
Asia or whatever ended travel with us

573
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Just for that period of time

574
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Every time we go to a chance we

575
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Go and travel as a family but mainly

576
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
20 was doing the writing and the

577
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,360
Planning and all that and I was doing the

578
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Carpentry

579
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Keeping it together

580
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah I would actually move.

581
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
Kind of ramshackle office

582
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Kind of

583
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Loose

584
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Contractor

585
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
In and out do a bit and Float out again and we paid them

586
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,280
By the hours for the same so it was beginning to take shape

587
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
As a real business

588
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
When at what point did you stop having

589
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Sleepless nights

590
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
About whether you work

591
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Every year

592
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
I would say it actually towards

593
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
Late 80s early 90s

594
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
Increase more when

595
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Became

596
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
I'll be a set this thing

597
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Momentum and its

598
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Who's carrying us

599
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
As much as we were

600
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,952
Pushing it I'll talk to people who are doing that and handing the publishing it out that time

601
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
And they said it just seems like

602
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
We couldn't do anything wrong

603
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
But every book we did our souls and

604
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
I think when we started doing Europe guides

605
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Cuz we

606
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
We were just little publisher at the other end of the world

607
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,800
Who started off doing Asia

608
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
How many finally did get around to doing Europe

609
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
We would think enough by that point we could really do it well

610
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
And I think people in the office pretty girl

611
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
Kick out of that but it was such a thrill

612
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
Doing that

613
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,416
Taking out anybody in the world who wanted to try and compete with us

614
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
Everywhere you went

615
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
When using any kind of guy

616
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,096
Thrill you know you can a New York sing someone coming with a German

617
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
Copy of Chinese

618
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
You know whatever I just died

619
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Was there ever a moment where

620
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
When doing well

621
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,432
Not looking very good

622
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,504
And I haven't arrived around 2000 and

623
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Beard growing so fast

624
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
The point where we're doing so much

625
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,672
We had television going we had started investing

626
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,488
Heavily into the digital side of things a lot of stuff a lot of

627
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
You know we created a whole lot of death

628
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
Publishing before receiving the term

629
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
The money the books were still selling like crazy but we were just doing so much and

630
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
In the middle of that

631
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
When 9/11 happened of course

632
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
People stop traveling on travel guides NJ

633
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Stopped

634
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Did you think that there was a

635
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Possibility that

636
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
I died

637
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,672
I mean

638
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,000
His charms but it's also one of the most infuriating things because

639
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
We were definitely looking

640
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Had a really bad

641
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
That time we were looking at

642
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Let people go

643
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Back on our offices

644
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Embassy Suite

645
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
The number books we did

646
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
And it was

647
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Looking

648
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Blazer

649
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Is possible to housing pictures

650
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,504
In retrospect I think it was much more accurate the month

651
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
People start pulling everything

652
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Together

653
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,352
I guess it was a wrap around that time and where do you

654
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Selling the company

655
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
I think we both felt that it wasn't

656
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
Same company anymore it was

657
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
It was turning into much more of a digital company in that has a way of taking over

658
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Everything

659
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,528
Chicken excited about kids

660
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
My kids are both worked in the company of one stage

661
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,904
Neither then we're going to take it over from us

662
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Panda

663
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
And we just began to feel it was time to

664
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Ubuntu something else

665
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
You did it feel

666
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Wait to sell it

667
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Teal

668
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Sad

669
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
One of the saddest

670
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
I remember walking to the ABCs

671
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Tony designer

672
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Define opaque

673
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
CBC

674
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Poop poop

675
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
Yeah and I said to Tony do you have your passport

676
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
And he said no I said no

677
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
Did you know guitar passwords I just go

678
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Straight up the hill and get out of here

679
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
We could still Escape

680
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
I think I drove the sale

681
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
More than Tony did

682
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,912
And I always wondered you know if afterwards

683
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,448
He would really regret that

684
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
I haven't

685
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
I know his son

686
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
It took

687
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Months

688
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
For me to

689
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
Like I still find it very hard

690
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
How to go back

691
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
To the office

692
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
You know I do

693
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
It's just hard

694
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
I mean from from

695
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Somebody listen to this

696
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
Outsiders perspective

697
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Tiger this week

698
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
You just live the dream I mean you got to

699
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
Travel around the world

700
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Create a company

701
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
Yeah you sold it inside yours anymore but it made you

702
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
You rich and look at your life

703
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
Every year we do

704
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
Are there every year I go places on my own

705
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,856
Lino Maureen would not want to go to

706
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:26,976
I wanted to check the radiation to hobos these days

707
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
My consumption of up

708
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
I'm curious

709
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
I interviewed

710
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
John Mackey the founder

711
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Whole Foods

712
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
The show and

713
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
He was talking about early relationship

714
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
If you had with

715
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
The woman that's the help

716
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
Start Whole Foods in and how it really

717
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Destroyed their world

718
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Broke down

719
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
He says you know business can really bring people together

720
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
Now I can do both

721
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
I mean you you guys are approaching V

722
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
Years of marriage and

723
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
It just sounds like you

724
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Credible partnership in

725
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
Were there times

726
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
Weather time from you were building up his company where there was two

727
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Tension and there was

728
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,736
Shut off fight Savannah scrubbles and always been playing silly

729
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
And you know you cannot

730
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
You cannot run a business will you bring

731
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Step into the office

732
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
It was funny but Lonely Planet people over the new

733
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
First of all you coming

734
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Talk to me about an idea

735
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
And I'll tell you whether it's worth

736
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Tony has what's What's called the five

737
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
6 seconds equal to 5

738
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
Second window to engage attention

739
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
You know it's like the lights

740
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Span of a mosquito

741
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
So they would come to me and say why not

742
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,224
I think this is right what do you think is good and they say

743
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Tony

744
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
You let me talk

745
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Talk to him first

746
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
How much of your abs

747
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
Your success and what happened with his company and

748
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
Everything

749
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,120
Using is due to lack and how much because you're just really smart and skilled

750
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,472
You definitely need that saying about you know whenever I'm working really hard I

751
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
I seem to be lucky

752
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Interesting places near parents did

753
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,856
Element they were a big mama

754
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
I don't know

755
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Skill

756
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
Came into it with Tony and I there was

757
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Judgmental

758
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Supposed end

759
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
And the fact

760
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
That we were doing something that we knew everything about

761
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
But it's clear that

762
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
His company could not have become what it became without without the both

763
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Me and you both brother

764
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Different skill sets

765
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
An amazing what you know

766
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
Dislike chance meeting on a bench and region

767
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Is Park resulted in this in

768
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Credible company what did

769
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
What were the

770
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Traits

771
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Both of you had like

772
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
You brought to the

773
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
Amor incense me nonsense

774
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Honey

775
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Lonely Planet would never

776
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
He

777
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
Was the dreamer the vision but he also

778
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Channel 8

779
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
New hires going to

780
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Lonely Planet

781
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
I'm very early on

782
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
And he never ran out of that pit

783
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
I got kind of mad

784
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Fousey

785
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
How is you through so many things

786
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
However

787
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
He was not

788
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
He never wanted to

789
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
Spring meetings he never wanted to

790
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Bankers

791
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,024
He liked all the stuff but you know he didn't want to hear what their problems

792
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
It wasn't terrible it was just

793
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Really

794
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
You just wanted to know what me book we're going to do

795
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
You know how big was going to be in where the maps and pictures of the book so we did

796
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Fabulous

797
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Execute

798
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Prison inside they just

799
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Better and better looking each

800
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
It was good

801
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't know that was Tony you know 22

802
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Needs this

803
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
You know this is what we need

804
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
To do with this

805
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
So I would say that

806
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
I guess I've always

807
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Could never visit

808
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Mr. Tony

809
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
But it probably wouldn't have

810
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
Held2gether long without me

811
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
Not agree with it

812
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,376
Tony and Maureen wheeler

813
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Founders of Lonely Planet by the way and its height the company was valued at a quarter of a billion

814
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Dollars

815
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,920
The wheelers are no longer formerly involved with the company they sold all their shares but Tony

816
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:36,320
Did recently score a gig writing a chapter for a new Lonely Planet book it's called epic drives of the world

817
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
And as I speak

818
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
Tony is a size 3 and 1/2 month drive from Bangkok to London in a classic British mg sport

819
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
And one last question for you

820
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,144
When you travel like what is the thing you have to have in your carry-on bag

821
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
My passport no credit card

822
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,944
Percussionist cozy and comfortable

823
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
What kind of Cadillac

824
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,624
I never seen that you have never noticed

825
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768

Hey thanks so much for

840
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Sticking around because

841
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Inow for Howie

842
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
You built that

843
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
The story will

844
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
It starts with a

845
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Plastic bottle and I have one

846
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,080
Right here in the studio with me slightly full of water but a quarter of the way up

847
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,920
Okay and that sound that is the sound of me

848
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,248
Flipping this bottle a full 360 degrees

849
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
So that it spins in the air

850
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,928
Right side up which by the way is not an easy thing

851
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,512
To do but it is the type of thing that middle school kids can become

852
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,400
Totally obsessed with the fact it was really popular

853
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
Which is where Michael Mendocino comes in everyone at school with my friends come over to my house

854
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:39,200
Just a flip bottle sometimes and we just see how many different cool trick shots we could do basically and just

855
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,600
Do cool stuff with it show Michael Pease 15 and his family in Celebration Florida

856
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,136
Night last November

857
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:53,280
Michael and his mom Nicole were at home watching TV we were just sitting around watching Shark Tank

858
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
I was actually bottle flipping and

859
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
We just came out

860
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,264
But the perfect idea to create a board game and turn bottle flipping into a board game

861
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
And we looked at each other and we said this is one of those just simple aha ideas

862
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
Instantly it wasn't

863
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,344
Like we had to discuss it but we just said let's do this but of course is Nicole Michael's mom anyway

864
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,416
Next day after Michael and his two younger sisters

865
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,792
Got home from school we actually sat down and all evening we worked on coming up with

866
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
A really crude prototype

867
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,936
We just got out the board games that we had in our house

868
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,496
And we just started brainstorming

869
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
So the game that came up with comes with

870
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
A bottle of bored with a

871
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Target on it

872
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
And a deck of cards that have a bunch of

873
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,480
Different bottle flipping challenges on the

874
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,808
Play put your arms in the sleeves your shirt like a T-Rex

875
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Send flip the bottle

876
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,464
Keep your eyes open without blinking and try to land five in a row before you blink

877
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,864
The Mendocino has found a manufacturer in North Carolina who agreed to make an initial run of 10,000

878
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Board games

879
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
We actually had the product available to ship on December 21st so we just barely made it

880
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Before Christmas

881
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
But of course I had to still get the word out

882
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
Yasso

883
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Most of the products

884
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,248
That I want to buy I see people playing them through YouTube

885
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,600
So originally I started by reaching out to a few people that I watch on YouTube

886
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,720
Eyeglass them hate can I can I send you this bottle Flip Game and will you take a look at it

887
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:33,120
We actually sent them the game and they put it on the channel and right now we have over 5 million views

888
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,960
All around from all different channels in their very first week

889
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
The Mendocino sold over a thousand games

890
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,408
And starting in August bottle flip will be sold in about a hundred Target stores and

891
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
If you're wondering about the sound of the bottle flipping

892
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,552
The closest hearing it over and over

893
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
Can drive a lot of parents

894
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Crazy

895
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,000
So that's definitely been like a hurdle as far as marketing goes

896
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
But Michael says

897
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
He's already started to notice

898
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,936
When the parents played with the kids they realize how fun it is and now the parents are kind of addicted

899
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,776
Bottle flip is still a side hustle for the Mendocino family

900
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
Both Nicole and

901
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Her husband are

902
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Dignity jobs in

903
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Real estate

904
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,736
But the game is already done $135,000 in sales

905
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
Since they launched it

906
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
In December

907
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Anacortes

908
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
She's already dreaming about the neck

909
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,136
Best idea for a boy
