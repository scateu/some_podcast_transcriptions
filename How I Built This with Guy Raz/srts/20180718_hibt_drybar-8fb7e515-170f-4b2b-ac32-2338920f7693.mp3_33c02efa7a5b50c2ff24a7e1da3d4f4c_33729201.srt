Call Drybar

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
When I was a kid growing up in Boca Raton and

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Southern Florida

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
School Bus

51
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Really her thing

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Nope wasn't interested in school wasn't very good at it

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,128
I was kind of dubbed the underachiever of the family I was like what the hell is Allie going to do with her life

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
She actually went to college and

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Everybody year

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Dropped out

57
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Should address that she lived

58
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
The New York for some time and then

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Florida love their parents

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
But her older brother Michael

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
He seemed to have it all together

62
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,888
He was like the overachiever of the family and he was like naturally good student like

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,960
We're Jewish and he had a bomb it's file I was like there's no way

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,312
But he did it and he was right he wasn't even like the smarty-pants of the family

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
So while I was sort of floating around in her early twenties

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Michael was

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
Doing pretty well for himself he was moving up the corporate ladder

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
1990s

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Started to have this idea of what

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
She wanted to do with her life

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
She asked Michael for bikes

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
You were the first person I talk to you I feel like I really want to go to Beauty School

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
That is what

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
I really wanted you and my parents were kind of like

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,264
Didn't get it and they have these little old lady clothing stores in Delray Beach and Boca

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
Next every one of them was a hair salon

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
He's like little old ladies getting their hair done

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
That's what you want to do if I know that is not what I want to do

79
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
New York City

80
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760

00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Yuan Heritage and my brother

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696

00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
My parents were sitting here they would tell you that

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Easy raised me the keeper very very very close

88
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656

89
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
That I had

90
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
So is it was living in Boca

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240

00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Enrolled in the local Beauty School

93
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104

00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
And I was like

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,119
As happy as can be and I thought I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom forever I loved every

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
3 second of it is

188
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
So great

189
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
And then we had her second son and Jim kids

190
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Yakiboy

191
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Yasso

192
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
It was like

193
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
You got a lot of hard surface

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
2

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
And after being at home rather stay at home mom for 5 years

196
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
I got really antsy again

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
I can't go to the park every day and I remember my husband used

198
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
To come home from work and I'd be like

199
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
Because I hadn't really tight

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Kids all day

201
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
And I felt like

202
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,815
Man I need to do something for myself again and that's that's that's what initially started and then it was like what am I going

203
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
Go back to working at Hair Salon Lake

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
I had two kids now what I want to do and

205
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
And because

206
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
Blowouts and doing hair was always my thing in so many of my girlfriends

207
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
We asked me to go out their hair all the time

208
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
Good hair ends

209
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
They would always ask me

210
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
No no no I was just do it especially if it were

211
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Was like for a party or an event or while you're something I just did everybody's hair

212
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
And I was good at it and so I remember like

213
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Sitting in my living room my best friend that are like

214
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Babies crawling around in

215
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Start

216
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Mobile blood drive

217
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
Where I go around

218
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Blowout

219
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
My mommy friends cuz I was very immersive

220
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Demonic

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Where is strong in LA

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
So I posted on this mommy

223
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Group called

224
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
Wechat where it was like a Yahoo

225
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
It was this resource for mom there's like 5,000 moms in LA

226
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
And they all went to the site

227
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
So I posted on there one day when I have this idea popped in my head I said I'm I'm a longtime stylist I'm thinking about starting a mobile

228
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Would anybody out there be interested

229
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
I got like yes I'm interested

230
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
Stratford

231
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Yes pretty much

232
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
Getting emails so then my husband was like any of this is

233
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Such a great idea

234
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
And he said

235
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
But you needed

236
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
She website if they think it's cute they'll call you

237
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Is this point you're thinking

238
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
This is going to be like my side Hustle

239
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Everything about getting a van

240
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,279
No no I was like I thought about putting all them tools I had in the duffle bag and heading out the door that with that car

241
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
In my car

242
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
And so you would blow Drive

243
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
At their humps

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Sleeping

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Because like we are all like

246
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
When are babies napping with you

247
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
I mean this is not a very liked

248
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Thought-out plan that was

249
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Is so basic

250
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,063
And honestly we came up with $40 because it was like cheap and easy it's like two 20s

251
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,439
Like you put this out there on website and all of a sudden

252
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
I totally want this in

253
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,631
The calendar and I started doing these blood and of course like I said to pick up my kids from preschool at like

254
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
LA traffic right now

255
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
I was in traffic

256
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
I can between gas and whatever I don't think I actually made any money

257
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Much more about

258
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
Getting out there and like talking to adults and just like doing something

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
For myself and being able to kind of

260
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
You know satisfy that

261
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Desire in me

262
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Something for myself again

263
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
So you start

264
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Doing this you start driving around

265
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
The westside of LA and I got really busy

266
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Really fast

267
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,047
And it was very word-of-mouth like I'd go and do one mom and then she would tell

268
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
Pics of her friends than I was and they would come it was such a thrill

269
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
And I got to the point where I was saying no

270
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
What I was saying

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
And so that's what I like

272
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Yeah this is interesting and I think that's

273
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
Then I started asking my clients I said what what do you do when I can't

274
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Well

275
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
Either like begrudgingly go to my colors longer they overcharged me and want to cut my hair and there's all this

276
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Pressure

277
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
Or I go to the bike discount chain down the street which

278
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Kind of sucks and experience is bad in bad lighting and

279
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
Cuz I got there really is too bad choices are there and that's it

280
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
And so that's when I think the idea started

281
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,007
Percolating for me and I was like huh you know there's no place like in the middle and that's what I went to my brother

282
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
And he was working for Yahoo at the time also when Yahoo was in like

283
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Is like that

284
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Really sick

285
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Fon

286
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
He's watching my little business from the sidelines and he thought it was an interesting idea but

287
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Nothing beyond that

288
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,135
So I told him that I thought I should turn

289
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
My little mobile blood drive business

290
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,767
Into an actual brick-and-mortar so instead of me going to my clients they can start

291
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
I asked him to have a sickly help me and help me

292
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Kittatinny point

293
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Any any one particular thing man

294
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Say to you

295
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,615
Wait you want to start a store where you just blow dry hair and

296
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
What like what the hell is that like why would anybody pay you

297
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
And they're like

298
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
They have know they're like

299
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
What

300
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Although my husband

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
Always had this interstate inside because he doesn't my hair looks like naturally and he always would say

302
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,863
You get your nails done but I never notice it when you get your hair done I notice it

303
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,983
And so he was like I think this is the next nail salon I think this is going to kill it let's do this

304

I'm guy Raz

345
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
So Alli Webb had this idea for a business where you just

346
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
Blow dry people's hair no cutting no coloring

347
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455

Soap to start the company

351

They cashed out Cameron's retirement account and Michael put in a chunk of money he made during the.com Boom at Yahoo

352
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
And the three of them

353
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
They tried to get to work trying to figure out the details of what tribe are would be

354

And Cameron was

359
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
A creative director in advertising

00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Sinbad and

366
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
You working and drive aren't the Cameron at night started developing the dry bar website

367
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Building a website

368
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,679
And he's really knew that you never built a website but he was the designer

369
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Said he could do all of that

370
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
So

371
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,383
In the wee hours of the night for weeks we started developing the website and Michael and I started looking at real estate and trying to figure out where the shop

372
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
I was going to go and

373
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,551
Talking to landlords all the side crazy stuff and I was on the phone with a cosmetology board like around the clock trying to figure out

374
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
What I needed to open these this shopping

375
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
And then it yeah that's kind of how it all started

376
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
What are you nervous

377
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Did you feel like it

378
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
This will be okay or was like a part of you who

379
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
Like this is a lot of money that we put into this

380
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,775
They were more nervous than me my brother she's probably the most nervous cuz he had the biggest steak in it financially

381
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
But I had a really good feeling

382
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
It was like one of this into my God I was like

383
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,735
I know there's enough women out there like me that's when we'll make one shot

384
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
I'm sure once I was

385
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
At least work a little bit and

386
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
At at that point we had figured out if we

387
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Can do like

388
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,999
30 blowout today 3040

389
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
We can do

390
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
5 watts an hour and we're open

391
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,191
Like I would literally like you figure out how many if you were going to have to come in to make those number

392
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
But you were going to do that the blocks to write any you were going to be

393
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Arena shop

394
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
Blow drying hair and you have to hire

395
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
Yes will so that the hiring process

396
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Kind of funny

397
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
And there's a couple status it still work for us who remember this like I used to have service

398
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Come to my house and go out my hair

399
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
That was there

400
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
You know I would make sure they were nice

401
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
And then they did a good job

402
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
I mean that was it back then

403
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
And I only hired like

404
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
I don't know about this

405
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Stylist and I wasn't

406
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
Sure one thing that wasn't sure about is if

407
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,543
There was enough Silas out there like me that that was interested in

408
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
Jeff the sailing part like I was but

409
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
There were

410
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
What was it that

411
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Was going to be your like

412
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
Additive Advantage like what was there is no competition

413
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
Nobody thought of it there was nothing but you owe you

414
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
If you found a spot in words

415
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Open the first location

416
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
So I was living in Santa Monica and

417
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
The first location was on San Vicente

418
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
Which is a thoroughfare so

419
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
If you came off

420
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
The 405 you were going to Santa Monica

421
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
The Palisades or Brentwood

422
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Had to take that

423
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
That route

424
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,639
And also I should tell you that my brother having worked on other big projects and

425
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
GMAT

426
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
This guy named Josh heitler who's an architect

427
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
And so my brother

428
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
One of the many many things

429
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
When I

430
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Had this idea to have a salon

431
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,183
He went to Josh and then I do want to build a hair salon for my sister

432
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
And Josh

433
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Was like

434
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
Sure and Baton be offered in some Equity to

435
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
To get involved in

436
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
That was again I don't even know if I would have thought of it Arkansas

437
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
That was my brother

438
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
And what was your vision like what was

439
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
When he came to talk to you what did you say like how did you want it to look

440
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Well and you wanted it to feel like a bar

441
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
And

442
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
I remember explaining to my brother and

443
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Josh

444
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
That

445
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
If

446
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,159
That's something that happened to my mobile blow-dry business that when I would go to my client's homes and do their blowout there's usually like in their living room

447
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
I was never

448
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
In their personal bathroom in their home so I do it in her living room

449
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
The currency

450
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Blowout

451
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
And when I was done with the blowout

452
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Are they okay I'm now I'm ready for you to look

453
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Forget it

454
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
And so to go from

455
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
Knots in your hair to see this amazing

456
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Gorgeous Hair

457
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,127
Is it kind of a powerful thing and I explain that to Josh and to my going

458
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
And don't

459
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
That was kind of a task for Josh like how do we

460
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Incorporate.

461
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Into the design of the shop

462
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
The Wii

463
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,183
The mirrors are behind the stations and that's very intentional that when

464
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
The client is done stylist

465
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Intermountain

466
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
And I totally game for my

467
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
My love is this

468
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
So

469
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
Daddy was at the experience

470
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Is going to be

471
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,983
Different well and I wanted again it was like taking

472
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Everything that I had accumulated in

473
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,383
In all of my years as being a stylist and saying like I'm just going to do it the way I want to do it not the way

474
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
It's always been done in

475
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
Of course it was like a bar and I wanted to fight

476
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
Because I thought that would be like

477
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Fun getaway for women in leg

478
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
All I got chick's legs

479
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
But then it's like movies that you probably wouldn't watch a movie you see them and they have subtitles you get really drawn in I mean I said there's sometimes it.

480
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
I love this

481
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Sleepless in Seattle

482
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Seattle like how to be single like

483
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
We play like Breakfast at Tiffany's like all of it

484
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
Am I Michael my brother had the idea to put

485
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Charging stations for iPhones that everything is like it was such

486
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
We got so lucky the fact that

487
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
My brother and

488
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
My husband

489
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Josh

490
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
And music.

491
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Storm of all these people that came together

492
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
To do that send that had

493
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
The perfect skill set

494
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,815
We were this like power has it nobody had to pay anybody to do so you open

495
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
The first location in Brentwood in

496
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
In 2010

497
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
What happens if

498
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
People show up

499
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
So I don't know if you remember dailycandy

500
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
The daily email list

501
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Sure thing about

502
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Fashion right

503
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah well it back and it's like

504
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Original state dailycandy was

505
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Dislike

506
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Websider

507
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
And you get emails from them and they would be these like

508
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Places you never heard of nude break like business

509
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Negative

510
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Of information that nobody knew

511
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
And we got dailycandy to write a story

512
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
About Drybar coming

513
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,167
That must have ran like three or four days before we opened

514
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Remember sitting at lunch with my brother

515
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Honor blackberries

516
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
Facebook for iPhones and we used to get appointment notification

517
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Alexander City

518
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
Freezing all these appointments are became like

519
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,039
We thought that they can we find out if the system was broken really what is going on

520
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
And then some

521
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Send us the Daily candy somewhere like

522
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Oh my God

523
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
If you can stay with candy red say and so

524
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Everybody started booking appointments

525
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Before we even open

526
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Answer that very first day we open to a very very

527
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
People shopping so

528
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
That first day was

529
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Banana

530
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
SME women were like

531
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
Light-up remember past because they were coming and they're like it

532
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
It said you could walk in and I'm like

533
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
We don't have any more chairs and I was I was

534
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,455
Blow out to the first chair and I was running the front desk and I was I mean I was I was there around the clock

535
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Probably first

536
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Before I took a day off because

537
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
I believe it was so

538
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
So you guys were incredibly busy like right from the beginning so so were you making a profit in that first year

539
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
Well even within that first year we turned

540
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Everything back in

541
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
So not really

542
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
But you know me we were buried

543
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,312
Putting anybody of ourselves and it within six months we opened our second store

544
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
And it just kept going either way. How did you scale it up

545
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Obviously

546
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
The process of

547
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Scaling up when you didn't

548
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,368
Have a whole lot of cash to work what that was that was a challenge and that's where it's like thank God for Michael

549
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
To cam and I are like

550
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Create as in where like

551
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,512
What now you know we really didn't know what to do

552
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Books for business

553
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Got it all

554
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
But we all knew we had something on her hand and we used to get women coming in being like

555
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Can you get these Beverly Hills women their own shop

556
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,800
It was I couldn't get into but that's not very cool

557
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Everybody knows

558
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Integer

559
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,456
This point leave his job cuz I wasn't taking a salary I was like

560
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
If you still needed his salary so he wasn't but he was still doing a lot of work meme

561
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Gosh my up for has

562
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
Then he was basically working two full-time job and you at your kids

563
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Tamia kids

564
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
So I it was crazy with

565
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Such like a life

566
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
You know we just didn't

567
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
We couldn't believe

568
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
Eliza Jane

569
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah and then

570
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
A Cameron stayed

571
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
I think it was

572
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Is that a year-and-a-half before he actually left

573
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
His job to be able to

574
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
Take him to drive our full-time

575
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
So as you started

576
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Scale app

577
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
Did you have to go

578
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Find Outside investors

579
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Set again I knew nothing about raising

580
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
Michael started today

581
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
I think we should franchises cuz we have

582
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Mob the franchise request

583
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Remember like we had

584
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
Of our first meeting with like a franchise Consulting Group at Cameron's

585
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Office lights

586
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Conference table

587
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Crystal.

588
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
But so we started getting like our

589
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Imitation in

590
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Together so we could franchise

591
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Denso

592
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
I was a little like

593
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,272
And not like super excited about franchising cuz I didn't I didn't want to give it away is how I kind of felt about it

594
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
You would be freaked out that

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
You know

596
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
Disenfranchised couldn't

597
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
Maintain the quality that you are

598
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Oh yeah

599
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
Wake me up at night and then we

600
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
We are very very pretty

601
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Tickler and about

602
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,400
We franchise with and made sure that they understood

603
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
The importance of all of that stuff in

604
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
And like I said there

605
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
There is that fear in there

606
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
We're still is that fear today but

607
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Is great and it really did help

608
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Spread our name and

609
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Much quicker

610
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
We could have if we didn't

611
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Franchising and then we're raising money to

612
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
You guys opened

613
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
Ikea first store in 2010

614
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
Just crazy how many locations do you have today

615
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
67-68

616
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
As of tomorrow

617
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
It's pretty insane that you go from

618
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Being stay-at-home mom

619
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
To running a

620
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,936
Executive multimillion-dollar

621
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Company in like

622
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
2 years

623
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
How did you

624
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
Mentally make that transition

625
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
It's still

626
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,176
So am I going to all of us that it took off and having the way it has it

627
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,552
It's been such a shift it is it was hard and it still hurts

628
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Thisday balancing it all with

629
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
The kids and

630
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
But I think we all kind of grew into it pretty naturally in

631
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,792
There's so much passion behind what we're doing we all love it so much that

632
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Does Provident Adrenaline Rush that

633
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
It was a lot of

634
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Figuring it out as we went along

635
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
But but we did

636
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Do you work

637
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
More now or do you work less

638
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Now the thing you did when you started

639
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Different kind of work

640
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
In the beginning I was in the stores

641
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
Non-stop all the time

642
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
And I I remember so well

643
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
When it went from like

644
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
3 to 5

645
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
The seven

646
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Stores and being like

647
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
Can't be in all the stories I don't have one time anybody I used to be able to remember we had

648
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
Brentwood West Hollywood

649
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Palisades in

650
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,376
Csed like I could hop around those are pretty

651
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
Easy for me to get to store to store

652
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
And then as we started

653
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Grow

654
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,080
You know I slowly but surely like started bringing in people who

655
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
Either we brought in a regional manager

656
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Manager

657
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
The regional manager and any kind of kept going like that and that way and now

658
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Now we have

659
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
This massive infrastructure now.

660
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Welders

661
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
. 3000

662
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Stylist

663
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Cinema

664
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Dollar movies

665
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
70 80 people in art

666
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Support Center

667
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
It's pretty massive now and so now it's like

668
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
I don't have to be in movies

669
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Everyday was like

670
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
But then it's like

671
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
There's days that I'm like

672
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
Decisions get made and things get me that I'm not involved in any more which I

673
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
We used to be involved

674
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Insomuch

675
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
You know it's like

676
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
It's very hard for me to walk

677
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Answered that walk-ins where can I see everything that needs to

678
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Be fixed and changed

679
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Yeah where

680
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,856
I don't get to enjoy that much

681
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Which clients do

682
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
Does that not only drive you crazy but drive the people in the store

683
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
When I come in

684
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
I think it's

685
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Eating it makes everybody nervous

686
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
So weird to me why are you mad

687
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
But it does and that is

688
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Truly the weirdest thing in in

689
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Courtney Garfield

690
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Dresser

691
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
She's like why don't you understand that

692
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
What have you learned about

693
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
You didn't have

694
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
Business Degree you didn't have

695
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Grains do I need to soak

696
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
What are some of like that your strengths that you learned about in your weakness as you learned about as you had to kind of take on these roles

697
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Strength is

698
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,912
Was the confidence that I knew this business

699
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,472
Nobody could tell me I didn't know this business

700
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
How to treat customers

701
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Stylist I knew how to make this business work

702
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
And you had talked to people I think from

703
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,664
NPR you don't everything I had done

704
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
I always felt like

705
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
Everything I can let me

706
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Into this moment in my life and I felt like

707
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,112
I had what I used to have to run the store

708
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
And then there's things that I didn't know

709
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
That that's where Michael and Kim K

710
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,792
Michael newdow higher like music

711
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
Even do that was a thing like I eaten so there was

712
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
So much of like the things I do

713
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Didn't know we're filled and I think that that was one of my big

714
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Learning experiences

715
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
You need to bring on people who know but you don't

716
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,664
What is m in a lot of people would say I would never be able to

717
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
Twerk as my partner in a business

718
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Like it's a really

719
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
Hard but it sounds like you guys have

720
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
A really you know

721
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,880
Functional working relationship in a great marriage

722
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Is that true images of wizard attention

723
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Engine is running

724
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
Yes I mean they're there is a mean

725
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
My husband and I is certainly a struggle and

726
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
And yeah I definitely comes with

727
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
It's challenges but

728
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
Be good so much more hours

729
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Is the god and we

730
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
We have especially now we have different

731
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Games that work under us

732
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,128
And so we don't have to like we don't work nearly as much as we did in the beginning

733
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
There's so much trust that you have when you're working with

734
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
Your husband and your brother that

735
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
It supersedes everything I think

736
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
If I said to you

737
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
7 years ago when you were

738
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
Yeah I'm driving around in your Nissan

739
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Xterra

740
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,400
Disable songs blow drying hair

741
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
Country ending to be doing a hundred million dollars

742
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
In Revenue year would you be like

743
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
You're out of your mind

744
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
Pretty much I mean

745
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Could not see

746
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
That far down

747
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
And I remember people asking us

748
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
You know what's next for you guys and I was like

749
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
We're going to keep opening stores in

750
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
I think it was

751
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Did to be at 6

752
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
57 I mean it's on my plate because it wasn't

753
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Premeditated like

754
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,280
We didn't have a business plan it wasn't like this is our goal this is

755
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
There was not a bad it was all this very

756
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,912
Organic and we're onto something so we're going to figure it out in

757
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Keep growing

758
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,472
Yeah and it's very

759
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,824
Very rewarding for me personally because I was the one in the family that I really like

760
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,408
Fall Guy was Ali going to do and it's so it's it's

761
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Particularly gratifying so Chic my parents who have seen

762
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
My brother and I

763
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
Need to get our business and we love that were able to

764
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Be closed

765
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
On another level through the business

766
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
It's pretty special

767
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
Alli Webb founder of Drybar accompanied by the way is planning to expand internationally

768
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,400
Canada and also into Europe

769
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
Ellie just published a book all about blow drying hair it's cold with Drybar guide to good hair for all and

770
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
You better believe it if you met her or suffix whatever but Ali's hair is actually actually curly

771
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
I guess I should clarify you a very

772
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
On curly hair right now

773
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,648
But this is like a very carefully Style

774
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,536
Well I am a professional stylist myself and I have been for 20 years so I actually did my own hair

775
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
I know how to do that

776
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
And please do stick around because

777
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664

The clouds themselves

785
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720

It's for a clean crisp

787
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024

I never how you built that and today we're going to update a story we ran last

797
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,992
And the story comes from Chris Healy of San Diego

798
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,856
Entrepreneur wanted to solve a problem

799
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
Before we get to the problem.

800
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
A bit about Chris my hair is

801
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Blond

802
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
It's

803
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
About down to the middle of my back to Chris

804
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Lindsay there

805
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,472
Heron

806
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Shields in 1982

807
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Because of

808
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,176
They kept running into a problem that a lot of men with long hair face

809
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
We go to the women's hair care oil

810
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Search

811
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
For the hair ties that look the least girly the struggle is real guys it's not

812
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
A very fun

813
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,560
Experience when you have to choose the least bad option

814
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
One day in this is back in 2014

815
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,960
When Chris was driving back with Lindsey after visiting a client

816
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,080
It came to it I swear it just popped out that the words just popped out I got it

817
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
It's hair ties

818
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
4 guys

819
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Ensure

820
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
A more manly man bun scrunchie

821
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
Chris wanted a hair tie that was a little bit wider a little more comfortable and with some cool.

822
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
Designs he wasn't seeing in the drugstore aisle

823
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Everything from surfboards

824
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Lightning bolt

825
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Martini glasses camouflage

826
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
Rocket launchers

827
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Fun designs

828
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,984
So Chris and Lindsay. We got this great idea

829
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Let's make some hair ties

830
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Quick and easy

831
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,920
But it wasn't so simple we started out buying or a material time them off

832
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Finally going to manufacturing connection we got the first round with our designs printed on them not what we were looking for

833
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Finally probably

834
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
5

835
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
Samples later we finally got what we wanted and it took almost two years from the time that we had

836
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,888
Had the idea until we had the product ready to sell that was back in December of 2000

837
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
15

838
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,008
Since then they've sold more than 30,000 packs of hair ties

839
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
The customers all over the world

840
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Their website

841
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Is called the long hair

842
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
We truly are a Lifestyle brand because having long hair is a lifestyle it's a choice

843
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,856
Lookat DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are Harry Styles and of course David Beckham

844
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,672
Celebrities who have all at some point

845
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,280
Warn a man bun which is a term Criss actually doesn't really like

846
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
So we call it a highball

847
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
Like a fine glass of

848
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Scotch

849
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
It's refined

850
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
Dignified

851
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
And it portrays the

852
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Proper

853
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,336
Respect of the fine men's hairstyle that it is

854
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
That's Kristi Lee co-founder of the long-hairs

855
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
Since we last spoke to Chris he and Lindsey are both working

856
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,064
Full-time and earning a living with the long hairs

857
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
They also established a charity partnership

858
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Make wigs and next year

859
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:37,024
