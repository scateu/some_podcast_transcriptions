The story of Instagram

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Enjoy

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,368
It was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people screaming and nothing more crushing than then seeing

20
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
Are people posting on Twitter on their blogs and say like another doesn't know how to scale like Alexa

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Clowney

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
We are both

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Running on zero

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,984
2 days devastated and I was like this is it we've built this great thing and we totally messed it up

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
From NPR how I built this

26
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,552
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Walk on the beach spark that idea that turned all of us

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
It's a good photographers and made Instagram one of the fastest-growing apps of all time

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Okay it's 2009

30
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
And, sister a mister

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,200
The figures out of Stanford and doing the Silicon Valley thing

32
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
Travel startup by day

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296

At night

35
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Airfare from college Mike Krieger is

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Is also in the area

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Pretty much doing the same thing

38
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
After a few months of experiment

39
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Kevin build an app

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
He calls it Bourbon and

41
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
The check it out

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
You can tell your friends you're at

43
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Coffee shop or bar or wherever

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Kevin thinks this app has

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
You know

46
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Some potential

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
I mean at that time there were so many checking apps there was four square there was gwalla and there were a bunch of others trying to make

48
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
I'm in of course following

49
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
You know,

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
The trend I was like there's something here about

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
The devices in everyone's pocket

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
It's being available to share new types of

53
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Information

54
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
And I was like location is

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Is the type of information people are gone

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
I don't want to share

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
I think the inside Mike and I had along the way was that

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm actually there were more types

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Information the fact

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
These devices had a camera

61
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,592
That would lead to a visual communication Revolution we're like all of a sudden people aren't

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm just communicating

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Text invoice

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
But they had the chance to communicate with

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
With an image

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
But initially art that was on location and

67
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Franklin

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Very happy that we

69
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Discovered the image thing while I'm away

70
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Some people were using this app

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Yeah

72
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
You know it was just compelling enough to get like a handful of beta users but I would you know basically come home

73
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
Night and just Tinker with this idea

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
And

75
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
You know along the way

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
I prototype it enough that I was willing to give it to a hand

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Four friends and those friends give it to

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Handful of friends

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,040
And before you knew it we had I don't know maybe 80 90 people using it and only at that moment

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,648
I did I decide that like hey maybe this thing could be a company if we actually tried

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Then like

82
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
At what point did you say we

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
We should travel

84
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Like raising money for

85
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
I went to a bar

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
We're a bunch of investors were getting together

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
And

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,800
I like I kind of mingled around the room and people are kind of showing their prototypes on their phones two different investors

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
And I showed it to this one investor is named Steve Anderson

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
And he was one of our First Investors

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
And he was like this pretty cool let's set up coffee

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
You know

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
We can meet up and you can tell me more about the app and

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
That was like the biggest combo

95
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Richmond today.

96
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Oh my God there's an investors willing

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Talk to us

98
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,303
So I went and I had that coffee and I sat down and

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
As we were

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
We're talking actually I have an alert

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
That would alert on my phone every time someone signed up

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Because I was really excited

103
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
M80 user stated 5u

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
90 user

105
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
And I'm as I'm sitting there with him like a bunch of people are signing up and I wasn't entirely sure why but he looked at me and was

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Did you plan this like

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,063
That you have a bunch of people sign up while you were done with me I said now I

108
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Like honestly don't know

109
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
People are

110
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
He looks at me is like alright Count Me In

111
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
But he actually said one thing to Migos

112
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Before I do this

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,791
You have to find a co-founder that's willing to do this

114
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
And at that moment I was like all right

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
Got to find someone awesome

116
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Partner

117
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
To Mike how did you guys like

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
I mean how did it happen

119
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Like you came to Kevin you're like I like this

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
I think it's cool I want to work with you I mean

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Gee whiz are more formal than that

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
I think of where that came from was we had a kind of shared kindred spirit of tinkering so on the weekends a lot of times I would be

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Coffee bar

124
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
A great coffee shop here in Sanford

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Cisco and I'd be working on iPhone app

126
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Just for fun and bourbon

127
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
That the checking itself I didn't find ask

128
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Compelling but

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
Having a sort of visual status was really

130
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Compelling soap

131
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
I got excited enough that I think I

132
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Yeah, but Kevin is like luck if you ever do this

133
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Real life

134
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Have a conversation

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
And I think that first meeting we had about it actually I was like

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Count Me In

137
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
Like I'm I'm excited enough to do it and not like the the cliche of your life flashing before your eyes like my future

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Future flash before my eyes were talking to heaven right then

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
I just imagined

140
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Myself

141
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,791
Working one-on-one with him on something that I was really excited about in San Francisco

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Trying to make something of it and I was like

143
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
There was something in me that just stared at that time

144
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
So just got my first check

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
When you met that invest

146
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
He just he was just like

147
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
There's a bunch of money

148
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Well

149
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
He was like okay

150
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
I'm willing to give you $50,000 to

151
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
To do this and that's more money than I had ever heard of in mind

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Entire life for a business cutting at the time

153
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
But the second someone shows any interest in you and selection Valley all of a sudden you have a bunch of other people that really want to invest as well

154
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,839
What's the Mystic mistbox right no one wants to miss the next Google the next whatever and that

155
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Initial check 1 from 50000 to 250

156
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
15000

157
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
And then there was another investor in

158
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Andreessen Horowitz who came in and

159
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
And and put 200

160
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
$30000 in

161
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
So you're two guys with like basically a prototype

162
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
And a couple of computers no office

163
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
Who raised a half million dollars and we're looking at each other like

164
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
We think we can make this last I mean we were we were living on

165
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Peanut butter and jelly song

166
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
So how did you guys

167
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
How did you turn bourbon into

168
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
What became instant

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
What was

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Who's the Genesis of

171
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
I think the best thing for any entrepreneurs

172
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Failure and

173
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
4 oz

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Where was

175
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Is the lack of

176
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
Momentum we are mentioned we got to

177
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,967
We got about a hundred users using this app

178
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
No no no a hundred like you can fit them in our room

179
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
And Eric Reese is this guy in Silicon Valley likes to you no talk about

180
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
The Lean Startup method

181
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
One of his on

182
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
One of his lines is like don't ask like

183
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Don't use your startup ask why the

184
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
The people who continue to use your startup

185
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Keep using it

186
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
And when we looked at our our user base our whole hundred people

187
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Each of them loved

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Did the photo aspect

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
So that's why we ended

190
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
And photos but they were already

191
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
A bunch of photo websites

192
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Even photo app so

193
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
So how are you able to come up with

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
An idea that

195
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
That would make

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Your thing different

197
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
So we're both kind of burned out

198
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
We had

199
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Decided the bourbon was going to do anything

200
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,535
We had you know $495,000 left

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Open the bank because

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
$5,000 to buy a couple

203
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
What computers right

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
And I'm here like all right it's okay if this idea doesn't work out we can really string this half a million dollars

205
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Not for a long time so

206
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
We're going to come up with a new idea

207
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
So we started focusing on photos and we were both burned out I was like right like I got to take I got to take a break

208
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
So my now wife and I

209
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Nicole went to Mexico

210
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,255
And we were working on this idea photos of Mike was like alright I'm going to prototype this thing while you're on break

211
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
You come back and then we'll like reconvene

212
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
So Mike started prototyping this app

213
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
And as I'm away I'm

214
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Walking down the beach

215
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,775
Nicole in Mexico we were in this little surfing town called Todo Santos

216
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
And

217
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,687
I'm like you know Nicole I think we're going to focus on photos and she goes oh yeah. That sounds like a great idea I love all the food

218
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Photo post

219
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
John Berman

220
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
But she goes I don't think I'm going to post that much and I got to go why not and you guys all my photos aren't that good

221
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
I said well

222
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
They're great and she goes well they're not as good as your friend Greg and I was like well Greg uses a bunch of filter apps to like make them

223
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,679
You should probably add filters I was like oh that's it

224
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,775
Like we we just need to be able to make people feel like

225
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,127
Their photos are worthy of sharing

226
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
And I remember going back right from the beach I sat in the room with the little dial-up connection

227
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
That that little Hacienda had

228
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
And I I literally just like

229
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Research how to make

230
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
The first filter

231
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,815
Which ended up being called X pro2 and if you scroll all the way back on my account to the very first photo

232
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,447
There's a Nicole's foot and a little stray dog in Mexico and that's because that day I made expert 2 and I went out

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
The taco stand

234
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
For lunch to test it

235
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
And I took that picture and posted it on

236
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
On the Prototype that Michael

237
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
So

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,271
That was kind of that the intersection of the ideas of photos and filters and all came through

239
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Consumer insights was just like

240
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
What problem are we solving

241
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
Share something that people love

242
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,207
And make sure that they feel great sharing it

243
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Tosa how long did

244
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Take from the time he

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
You decided to

246
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Move away from Bourbon and then

247
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Launch Instagram

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,727
It was only eight weeks from the time we had basically sketched it out to when we

249
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
Put it into the Apple Store

250
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
We press launch on October

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Temp

252
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
I've mm

253
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
It was like about midnight

254
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
And I

255
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
People just started streaming in

256
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
It was crazy

257
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
It was like like how fast

258
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
The first 24 hours with

259
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
25000

260
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
People sign up around the world

261
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Sound of big toe

262
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
The time

263
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Incredible what were you expecting that

264
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
No I mean

265
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,191
Couple things that showed how naive we were at the time the number one

266
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Midnight

267
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
In San Francisco

268
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
It's 9 a.m. somewhere

269
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
And we didn't quite realize how Global harvests could be

270
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
So turns out everyone who's signing up at the

271
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
The beginning actually lived overseas so when we looked into the database more like

272
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Who are these people

273
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
They all had

274
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Email addresses

275
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Germany

276
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Hong Kong and in various places around the world

277
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,975
And before you knew it we actually had overloaded our system and ever

278
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Was a very small

279
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Naive system is a single computer in it

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
Colocation space somewhere in LA

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah it was it was nothing more

282
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055
Exhilarating than seeing other people streaming and nothing more crushing than then seeing

283
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Are people posting on Twitter on their blocks and saying like another startup it doesn't know how to scale like Alexa

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Clowney we are both I mean at that point like

285
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
Running on zero sleep for 2 days

286
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,415
Devastated and I was like this is it we've built this great thing and we totally messed it up

287
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
And to be clear there's no reason we should have

288
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Succeeded like

289
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,863
I mean the server was just like it was down every other hour and like

290
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
People just kind of forgave us and they would come back and they would share their photos and

291
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
At the time mobile networks weren't that great either

292
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,615
So people would actually blame their connection and not us which is great

293
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
But those initial weeks I mean

294
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
It was just like

295
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,319
Trial by fire and we had to learn everything on the job and we had so many chances to

296
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
The failed we just kept

297
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
At it and

298
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
And kept working

299
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Pulled a bunch of all-nighters

300
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
The amount we learn to not first years

301
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Crazy was like 5 years of

302
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
College all-in-one

303
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
And yes pretty exciting

304
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
And tiring

305
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
How do people even find out about insta

306
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
How do they know

307
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Did they should download this

308
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Like this app

309
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
So we had this intuition that

310
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
If you're going to throw a party

311
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Which is kind of what an app launch

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Really is

313
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
People screaming to the door

314
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
You want the next sort of know

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
How they should act

316
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
And who else is there

317
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
So one of the things we did was

318
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
We have you have a hundred

319
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Invite

320
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
You can have before you launch your app to the app

321
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Apple store where you can invite people to

322
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Try it out and we like are we going to

323
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
People and we used them a combination of some

324
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Journalist that we've gotten to know over

325
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Know the last couple of

326
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Of yours

327
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Going to Valley

328
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
We also went on the site called dribbble.com

329
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Just sort of like

330
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
A place where designers Go and show off their best work

331
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,479
And we figured photographers might not instantly take the Instagram because like

332
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
They want like super high-resolution or if they have other

333
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Constraints

334
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Set designers love photography but it's not their main

335
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Job

336
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
So we picked basically

337
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
The 10 top designers on dribbble

338
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
And we emailed them and some ignored us

339
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Defining some Rebecca Thatcher I'll try rap

340
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
And it has great cuz coming in day 1

341
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
People who

342
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
What explorer things are going to popular pages

343
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Set the time that show the most popular

344
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Photos across the whole community

345
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
Blackbough you can take that on a phone like we take this for granted a little bit now and

346
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
The cameras have improved every year

347
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
But I think part of what we showed two people back in 2010 was that there was something really amazing you could do with

348
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Would just the phone in your pocket

349
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
Tonka backhoe

350
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,727
President Obama Snoop Dogg and about 500 million other people started to use Instagram

351
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,079
And what happened after Facebook bought it for a billion dollars

352
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,431
I'm guy Raz you're listening to how I built this from NPR

The Bold way to study

362

People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees

363
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,087

In all states

371
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
It's how I built this from NPR

372
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Garage

373
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
So it's been a year after its

374
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
X launch

375
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
And it's grown to

376
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
10

377
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Million user

378
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
And Mike Krieger and Ken

379
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Sistrum

380
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Ariix

381
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Expanding their staff very very

382
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
CenterPoint

383
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Did you guys have like

384
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Investors

385
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Banador

386
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
We have said investors office

387
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
We'd be like trying to keep the servers up and we have someone would like tap on her

388
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Actually I need like I am someone so from

389
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
So-and-so invest

390
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
And partners and I'd like to attend

391
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
Take you out for lunch I'm trying to keep

392
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Napoli's

393
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
But we met you know a bunch of people along the way and

394
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
The ones we did make time for we're the ones who are most

395
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Watchful of that time

396
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
I knew what we were going through anchor

397
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Help

398
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
So very shortly after

399
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Launch this thing

400
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
But it's valued at in

401
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
More than 20 million dollars

402
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Yeah

403
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Was I think our first round was like

404
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
I don't remember it was like weed

405
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
We took $89

406
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Financing online

407
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
20 president

408
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Roughly a 30 million dollar valuation

409
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
There's something

410
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
And I mean again

411
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
Attestation lifecycle

412
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Never heard of it

413
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Company that's worth

414
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
This is crazy

415
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
I didn't really think much of it I just wanted to get back

416
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
To work and I think Mike felt the same way we were just like so focused on building

417
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
What we're building

418
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
It just like

419
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Growing and

420
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
The question was

421
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
I got Mike and I

422
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Every single day worth

423
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
What scale can a

424
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Just got you and

425
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
I think it really started to hit us

426
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
When we would be out

427
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
And see people using it

428
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
In the real world

429
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
It was kind of cereal over time

430
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,639
Deserve it like from the outside the store just seems like

431
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Clear

432
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Linear like

433
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Jumping for

434
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Success to

435
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Success like it

436
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
EZPawn

437
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Put it up there

438
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
All this money in the

439
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Stratosphere

440
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
But we're at moments in the beginning even even after that initial

441
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
24-hour.

442
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
And Beyond where you thought this

443
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
I mean all the time

444
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Like 3 weeks in

445
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Kevin turned to me and he said Mike

446
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
I don't know how big is it going to be by think we're on

447
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
Something and I will see and every morning I would wake up

448
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
Expecting that that was the morning that

449
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Bratz doll

450
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
And that was it

451
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
And if I knew what I know now about metrics and how to measure the weather people are coming back over one day 7 days

452
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
30 day.

453
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,767
I would actually been I think a lot calmer because I think it would have shown as

454
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
Babe that shows now that

455
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
People who join Instagram tend to stick around and become more active and that's really exciting at the time I didn't know that other guy they're signing up are they

456
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
Can I come back tomorrow like is it all going to change

457
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
And that was sort of an internal

458
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Worryin externally

459
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Now as we launched and grew

460
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
Became a very competitive face and

461
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
We would see in a company's got announced

462
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Had

463
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,367
Tens of millions of dollars in Investments even before launching in real life

464
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Man like these guys have so much money

465
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
They're going to come in and you know attack us

466
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Going to be really hard and

467
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
That's the other lesson learned which is

468
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,679
You know your valuation and the amount you raise it can be helpful in building your product but it does absolutely nothing

469
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,031
Thank people and users don't care at all how much money you raised the care if you're providing some

470
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Car value

471
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
I'm in the product

472
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Lesson learned over time that you know you have to earn it everyday

473
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
I'm curious to get your

474
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Your take on

475
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Why it continue to grow

476
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
There are a lot of

477
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Cool apps

478
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
That you and I both know of the launch

479
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
560

480
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Years ago that were amazing at

481
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
People use that that

482
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Dawn and

483
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,703
There are lots of people who work really hard or really creative a really smart of Amazing Ideas

484
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
And put out a really cool

485
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Cool products

486
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
So why

487
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Why do you think Instagram

488
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Survive and thrive

489
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
I think there was this opportunity that we spoke of that

490
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Back in the day that

491
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
People had

492
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Cameras in their pocket

493
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
First time

494
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
And digital photography was clearly going to be a thing

495
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
But the second that camera got added

496
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
To the phone

497
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Emmanuel hot

498
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
That with you at all

499
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
All times

500
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
And that doesn't mean that you're going to

501
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Take photos on an obviously the quality has to be high enough

502
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,007
But we started the company right at the moment we're like

503
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
The quality of those cameras

504
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Just kind of met up

505
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Shoots and because of that

506
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Everyone starts

507
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
The phone

508
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
But they had no place to

509
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Or if they did it

510
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
It was hard I mean they would look at face

511
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
Maybe like well you know like have to upload them

512
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
I like on a desktop or

513
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
I on Twitter like doesn't really showing the timeline

514
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
I'm so they had this problem like there's no place to easily share all these

515
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Please photos. I'm taking

516
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
All the time

517
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
And we just happen to be the right

518
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Cool for that job

519
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
At the right moment

520
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
And

521
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Who created I believe the thing that kept

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Dick growing was quitting open network

523
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
We sat down

524
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Very early on

525
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Product design

526
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Oyster sauce okay

527
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Do we want to be

528
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
A place where you

529
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Send a friend request

530
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
You have to accept it in order

531
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Courtesy

532
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
Those photos or do we want to be open where anyone

533
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
I'm so glad we ended up

534
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Choosing the open model

535
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Because now

536
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
You can follow someone from

537
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Japan you can follow

538
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
You know a chef from New York City

539
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
You can file your favorite celebrity or you can follow your friends

540
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
A not like haven't really been done before

541
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
In photos if you look at

542
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Every photo service

543
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Rest before then

544
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
It was basically a closed only

545
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
Friend's only Network

546
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
And we were the first ones

547
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
It's really open that

548
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Yeah that was a moment

549
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
In my other radio show that

550
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
TED Radio Hour wear

551
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
PPL be like

552
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
How big

553
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
The show

554
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Became when when pink

555
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
The pop singer

556
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
He's about to shut we like wholly

557
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
She looks like

558
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
She was in the show

559
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Did you guys have a moment we would like

560
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Jesus like

561
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
They're using this thing that we built in like our basement

562
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
I think for me

563
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,847
The biggest one was the White House or obamacare's Obama joint first

564
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
I think it was part of

565
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Champagne

566
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
That he was running

567
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
And I remember like

568
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,063
Knows what Instagram is in the north how to use it and I remember

569
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
You know every

570
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,696
You know every time somebody is using our appetite either see or hear about a mic

571
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
Hope it doesn't crash I hope it works perfectly

572
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
I hope they like don't have any question

573
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
Keep them from using at so that was I think that a big infection moment and I think the other one was

574
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,520
I noticed that the New York Times when they would cover his head stop saying Instagram,

575
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
The photo-sharing app and then it was you

576
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
Instagram Aiko we are we have now reached the point where they they can assume that most of their readers

577
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Know what we are

578
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
I am old enough to remember when in PRC

579
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Would say

580
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Google

581
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,232
For me is I feel embarrassed because you had a really good example about like the president using

582
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
For me it was like our first celebrity of Snoop Dogg

583
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
Do you remember Snoop Dogg signing up

584
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
We were like

585
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,984
Is this actually Snoop Dogg and then I got an email that was like Snoop Dogg's people want to meet you guys and I was

586
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Oh my gosh

587
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
I don't even know what does it mean people like

588
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Snoop Dogg has people

589
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
And I remember Justin Bieber signing up

590
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
And and

591
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
The world going kind of

592
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Bonkers

593
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
Forgot as well and by world I mean

594
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Teenage girls and

595
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
They basically started using the app incessant

596
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
I kind of took off with like

597
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
A bunch of really young people

598
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
People as well

599
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
You obviously everybody knows

600
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Eventually you sold

601
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Instagram

602
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Facebook

603
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Billion dollar

604
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
I mean

605
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Incredible

606
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
All that to years

607
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
That happen

608
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
You couldn't have planned for that you couldn't have

609
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Even have been in ambition

610
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah I mean the first day

611
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
That we went home

612
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,064
After pulling that all-nighter to launch Instagram

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
There's a guy sitting on the muni here answer

614
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
San Francisco subway system

615
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
And

616
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
He was using Instagram

617
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,328
Oh my God like we did it but someone in the world is using this thing out in the wild

618
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
That feeling and that moment

619
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
Is the currency that you maximize

620
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
When you're not

621
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
It's like seeing someone using your product

622
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
And loving it is like way more rewarding

623
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Than any amount of money

624
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
In the world

625
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
You guys now or within the Facebook

626
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Family right

627
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Independent

628
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Company but you are part of Facebook

629
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
How to change the

630
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
You are obviously a lot bigger

631
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
Yeah and usually that was actually

632
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Pretty awesome because

633
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,144
We had all these problems killing our services in like

634
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
The Facebook infrastructure

635
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Can we come over and we seen that before here this is what you do

636
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
So I made our lives actually a lot better

637
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
And we were able to hire someone

638
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
The best people in the world end

639
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,528
And share talent I like to call ourselves the older brother or the other sibling where were the we were the first company to Facebook

640
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Fire dancer

641
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Kept running and then since then you've seen Oculus

642
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Send WhatsApp

643
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
And

644
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
I can do a lot of things that we figured out early on income

645
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Relationship

646
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
The office space

647
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Hiring

648
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
And I think we

649
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Off

650
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
From both sides of

651
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
Of the table I purchased it from

652
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,240
A spirit of hate how can we make Instagram better through these Integrations rather than

653
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,568
How can you make Instagram more like Facebook in or try to

654
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Adapted to be exact

655
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
There was this

656
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
This controversy that happened

657
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
With Instagram where

658
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
You change the terms of service and people aren't

659
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
The impression that the

660
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
The photo store

661
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
Your property in

662
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
A lot of people like

663
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
Black Instagram

664
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Grandma.

665
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Moment

666
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
There's only that I mean that's

667
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
Yeah that was a

668
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Learning lesson for Fugue for you guys

669
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Huge lesson

670
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Number one

671
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
People read the docs that

672
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
You know

673
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
You put out an

674
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
You should care about them as a

675
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,664
The founder so your terms of service basically what happened we have these terms of service that we had

676
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,760
I think effectively copied from some other site way back in the day and just

677
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
Find and replace their name with

678
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,368
Instagram because we're a startup we didn't know what we were doing

679
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
But we eventually got to a place where when we join Facebook Facebook is like hey you actually need a real one that like

680
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,352
Fits with the way you guys working working to make all these changes and we went through it

681
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,472
I was like a great this makes sense and I didn't really read it all that carefully

682
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
And one of the sections

683
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
It reading it again today if I look at it

684
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Can be interpreted that we were going to take

685
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
User photos and somehow use them in advertising

686
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
That was definitely not our intention and like no one in the Company of Thieves

687
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Thought of that idea

688
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,184
It just if you read the sentence that way you could see that maybe it would worry people

689
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
So immediately

690
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
You know we had to

691
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Big protest in

692
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
People

693
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
You know

694
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,656
Leaving the service I mean if we have a graph of account deletions at that

695
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Skyrocketing

696
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
And Mike and I sat down / like what do we do

697
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
And

698
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,128
And we felt helpless time it was like all over that was that first day all over again

699
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
It's like we screwed this up how do we make sure people know

700
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
I went back to my house like

701
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
Why don't we just apologize and say we're wrong

702
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,904
And I posted this Punk post on our block you can probably still find it online

703
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
And I was like we're sorry like

704
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
We didn't mean this

705
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
That's absolutely not what we're trying to do

706
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
We tweeted about it and actually the graph

707
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Deletions at that moment

708
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Drops to zero

709
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
And sometimes you just have to say sorry

710
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Sometimes you just have to say you were wrong

711
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
And reassert what you're actually trying to do

712
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
I'm at interaction with

713
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
The community still sick

714
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
And my mind is some

715
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
That we try to do every

716
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Every single day we

717
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Be really transparent

718
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
People put our community

719
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
81st because like at the end of the day

720
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Without them where a photo sharing app

721
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
How much of what happened

722
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
To you guys

723
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Instagram

724
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
And this whole story how much of it

725
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
I'd say 50%

726
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Actually I have this thesis

727
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Bad

728
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
The world runs unlock

729
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
The question is what you do with

730
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
Everyone gets lucky for some amount in their life

731
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
And the question is are you

732
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
Are you alert enough

733
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
To know you're being lucky right or you're

734
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
You're becoming lucky

735
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Are you talented enough

736
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Take that advantage and run with it

737
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
And

738
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Do you have enough

739
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Grits do you have enough like

740
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,280
Resilience to stay with it when it gets hard because everyone gets lucky

741
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
In minimal ways every week

742
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,656
Can you find a Dollar on the ground or you know you got a break at work to work on the

743
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
Project are you meet someone really interesting

744
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
The difference between people I think

745
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
If you succeed in the long run and the Pea

746
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,128
People don't is frankly that optimism that like

747
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,432
You got lucky and now it's yours too

748
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Yours to make awesome

749
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,576
And that first day I think we got lucky by having the right ideas the right time

750
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
The right place we

751
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
We were lucky to have met each other I mean

752
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
There are a lot of co-founding Paris

753
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,024
Intact who have not worked out and Mike and I are like great friends

754
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
Least I think so right Mike

755
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
And

756
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
The question is

757
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,568
Can you take that lock and capitalize on it

758
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,968
Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger by the way

759
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
After the sale of Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars those two became very very rich

760
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
But today Instagram according to Forbes is worth more than 50 billion

761
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
Dollars which makes Instagram bigger in dollar terms then places like Alaska

762
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
Maine Rhode Island

763
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:35,968
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things you are building

764
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
But first quick thanks to one of our sponsors

765
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Delta Airlines

766
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,416
Now you can enjoy free mobile messaging while flying on Delta

767
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,048
You can use iMessage WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger simply by logging into the in-flight Wi-Fi

768
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

769
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Time now for how you built that

770
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
And today we're doing a story we first ran in January featuring

771
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
When you tell people that you're leaving your successful software career to start a bike company you get two types of reactions you get

772
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
Wow that's amazing let me hear more

773
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
And then you get the

774
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,256
Oh okay go to lock willing to take that leap because

775
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Jesse loves bicycles

776
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,120
He basically grew up fixing them building them

777
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
A lot of times when he wanted to go out for a ride with

778
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,264
Was friends he'd run into this it always say

779
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,824
My bike has flat tires and needs a tune-up

780
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
And then of course me is the extra mechanic

781
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
I either have to go over early and tune up their bike

782
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Wouldn't go for a ride

783
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
So they decided to design the

784
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Find a bike wear

785
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
That type of thing would not happen we really really invented the bicycle going through every

786
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,864
Little not bolt piece component on the bike with the focus of low maintenance

787
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
Enzo in a basement Workshop in Manhattan

788
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Dave designed his first

789
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:07,616
Bike made of Aluminum and Stainless Steel with internal gears and disc brakes

790
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,944
But he says what he said his bike apart is that

791
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Instead of a greasy chain

792
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,112
It's got a belt drive made from carbon fiber that feels more like rubber

793
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
So there's no grease there's nothing to rust

794
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,072
There's no way to suck in your pants and leave you on the side of the road and it lasts three times longer than a tree

795
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
Now you might think a bike like this would cost like

796
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
Thousands of dollars but

797
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
They figured out a way to do it for a lot cheaper more like

798
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
$400

799
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,408
In his concept was so popular that he raised half a million bucks on Kickstarter

800
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
And then found two factories in Asia to make the bikes

801
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,344
But the matter years ago when it was time to deliver the first thousand bikes

802
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:55,744
He got into a jam we had our our bikes produced and they were on the water on their way over from Taiwan

803
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
When

804
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Customs took our containers

805
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,680
And tell them for an undetermined amount of time while they inspected them and even worse

806
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
This was in December

807
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,592
We started to get emails from our customers saying you're going to ruin Christmas

808
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
I bought this for my spouse for my son for my daughter

809
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Christmas

810
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
It needs to be under the tree

811
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
And all this almost offended the whole company

812
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
But about a week before Christmas

813
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,416
Customs finally let the bikes through

814
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,256
I was lucky we made it on the very last day we could

815
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
That's a weiner of priority bicycles

816
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
When we first spoke to him in January day was working on opening his first retail location in New York City and

817
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
Right now he has a showroom

818
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
It's downtown in Tribeca

819
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:47,712
And things are going really well priority bicycles now has Partnerships with more than 200 hotels

820
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784

And they're launching a line of accessories including some bike bags that just came out this week

822
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
And in August

823
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,768
Wired Magazine called his bicycles the ideal city bike

824
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
