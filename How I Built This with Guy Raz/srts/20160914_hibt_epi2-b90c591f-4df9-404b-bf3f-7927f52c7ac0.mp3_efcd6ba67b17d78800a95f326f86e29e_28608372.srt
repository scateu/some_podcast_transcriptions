1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Thanks

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,120
Who are 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,400
An email marketing

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Platform used by more than 250 thousand cost

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
With mobile-friendly email Tim

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
A drag-and-drop email Builder

7
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
And customer support

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
7 days away

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Campaign monitor.

10
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
It was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people streaming and nothing more crushing than then seeing

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Are people posting on Twitter on their blogs and say like another startup it doesn't know how to scale like like so clown

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,376
You're both like running on zero sleep

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,008
For two days devastated and I was like this is it we've built this great thing and we totally messed it up

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
From NPR

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
How I built this

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:56,832
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
On the beach spark that idea that turned all of us it's a good photographers and made Instagram one of the fast

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,472
Fastest growing apps of all time

19
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Okay it's

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
2009

21
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
And Kevin Systrom

22
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Just a few years out of

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
Stanford and doing the Silicon Valley thing

24
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Travel startup

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
My day

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
And teaching himself

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Kodak

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
At night

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
Different from college Mike Krieger

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
Is also in the area pretty much doing the same thing

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
And after a few months of experimenting

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Cabin build an app

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
He calls it bourbon in

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
The check it out where you can tell your friends your

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Coffee shop

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Le bar or whatever

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Kevin thinks this app has

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
You know

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Some potential

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
I mean at that time there were so many checking apps there was four square there was gwalla and there were a bunch of others trying to make it

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm in of course following

42
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
You know kind of

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,856
The trend I was like there's something here about

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
The device is Neverland

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
Pockets being available to share new types of information

46
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
And I was like location is is the type of

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Information people are going to want to share

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,936
I think the inside Mike and I had along the way was that actually there were more types of

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Information the fact that like these devices had

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
My camera

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
That would lead to a visual

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
Communication Revolution we're like all of a sudden

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
People aren't just come

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Getting texts and voice

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
But they had the chance to

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
You communicate with

57
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
An image

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
But initially art that was on location

59
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Frank Liotta

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Very happy that we

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
Discovered the image thing for him away so people were using this app

62
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Yeah

63
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,144
You know it was just compelling enough to get like a handful of beta users but I would you know basically come home

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Night and just Tinker with this idea

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
And

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,360
You know how long the way I prototype it enough that I was willing to give it to a handful

67
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
What friends and those friends give it to a handful of friends

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,064
And before you knew it we had I don't know maybe 80 90 people using it and only at that moment

69
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,648
Did I decide that like hey maybe this thing could be a company

70
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
If we actually tried

71
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Then like

72
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
At what point did you say we we should try to like racing money for that

73
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
I went to a bar

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
We're a bunch of investors were getting together

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
And

76
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
I like I kind of mingled around the room and

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Yeah people are kind of showing their prototypes on their phones to different investors

78
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
And I showed it to this one investor is named Steve Anderson

79
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Just one of our first

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Investors

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
And he was like this pretty cool let's set up coffee

82
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,856
You know we can meet up and you can tell me more about the app and

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,976
That was like the biggest accomplishment today and I was like oh my God there's investors willing to talk to us again

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
So I went and I had that coffee and I sat down and as as as we were talking actually

85
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
I have an alert that would alert on my phone every time someone signed up

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Because I was really excited when

87
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
From 80

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
85 years

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
90 users

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
And I'm as I'm sitting there with him like a bunch of people are signing up and I wasn't entirely sure why but he looked at me and was like

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Did you plan this like

92
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
That you have a bunch of

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
People sign up while you were done waiting to be nicer

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
So now I honestly don't know who

95
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
These people are

96
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
He looks at me is like alright Count Me In

97
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
But he actually said one thing to Migos

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Before I do this

99
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
You have to find a co-founder

100
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
It's willing to do this with

101
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
And at that moment I was like all right

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Got to find someone awesome

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Two kind of partner with

104
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Make this all happen

105
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
To Mike how did you guys like

106
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
I mean how did it happen like

107
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
You can't be Kevin you're like I liked

108
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
It's cool I want to work with you I mean

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Did you lose arm or

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Formal

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
I think

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Word came from was we had a kind of shared kindred spirit of tinkering so on the weekends a lot of times I would be at coffee bar

113
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,999
A great coffee shop here in San Francisco and I'd be working on iPhone apps just

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
For fun and bourbon

115
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
That the checking itself I didn't find as compelling but

116
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
Having a sort of visual status was really compelling

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
So I got excited enough that I think I've come up with Kevin was like look if you ever do this

118
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Real like what's up

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,455
Crustacean and I think that first meeting we had about it actually I was like Count Me In

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
She said like I'm I'm excited enough

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
To do it end

122
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,159
Not like the the cliche of your life flashing before your eyes like my future flash before my eyes were talking to Kevin right then

123
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
I just imagined myself

124
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,815
Working one-on-one with him on something that I was really excited about in San Francisco

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Just trying to make something of it and I was like

126
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
Like Ike there was something in me that just stared at that time

127
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
I just got my first

128
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
When you met at investor

129
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
He just he was just like

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Here's a bunch of money

131
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Well

132
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
He was like okay

133
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,783
I'm willing to give you $50,000 to do this and that's more money than I had ever heard of in my entire life

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
For a business cutting at the time

135
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
But the second someone shows any interest in Yuan Silicon Valley

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
All of a sudden you have a bunch of other people that really want to invest as well. No one wants to miss the next

137
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Google the next whatever and that

138
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Initial check went from 50000 to 200

139
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
50000

140
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,775
And then there was another investor in Andreessen Horowitz who came in

141
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
And put 200

142
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
$50,000

143
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
So you're two guys with like basically a prototype

144
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
And a couple computers no office

145
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,319
Who raised a half million dollars and we're looking at each other like we think we can make

146
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,903
This last I mean we were we were living on peanut butter and jelly sandwich

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
So how did you guys

148
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
How did you turn bourbon into

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Became Instagram what was

150
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Who's the Genesis

151
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
I think the

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
The best thing for a neon

153
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
NRS failure and

154
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
For us

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
Where was the lack of momentum

156
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
We I mentioned we got to

157
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
We got about a hundred users using

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
100000

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,319
100 no no no no a hundred like you can fit them in a room

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
And Eric races this guy in Silicon Valley likes to

161
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
You know talk about

162
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
The Lean Startup methodology

163
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
One of his

164
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
One of his lines is like don't ask why keep

165
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Don't use your startup

166
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Ask why the p

167
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
People who continue to use your startup

168
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Keep using it

169
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
And when we looked at our our user base our whole hundred people

170
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
Each of them loved the photo aspect

171
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
So that's why we ended up

172
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
But they were already a bunch of photo websites

173
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Open photo apps

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
So how are you able to

175
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
To come up with an idea that

176
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
That would make

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Your thing different

178
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
So we're both kind of burned out

179
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
We had decided the bourbon was going to do any

180
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Everything we had

181
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
$495,000 left in the bank

182
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
Because $5,000 to buy a couple of

183
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Computers right

184
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
And

185
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
And we're like alright it's okay if this idea doesn't work out we can really string this

186
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
Half a million dollars out for a long time so

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
We're going to come up with a new idea

188
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,247
So we started focusing on photos and we were both burned out I was like right Mike I got to take

189
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
I got to take a break so my now wife and I

190
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Nicole went to Mexico

191
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,535
And we were working on this idea photos of Mike was like alright I'm going to prototype this thing while you're on break

192
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
You come back and then we'll like reconvene so Mike started prototyping this app and as I'm away on

193
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,055
Walking down the beach with Nicole in Mexico we were in this little surfing town called Todo Santos

194
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,431
And I'm like you know Nicole I think we're going to focus on photos and she goes oh yeah that sounds like

195
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Like a great idea I love all the food

196
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Photo of house on Behrman

197
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,879
But she goes I don't think I'm going to post that much and I got to go why not and she goes well my photos aren't that good

198
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
I said well

199
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
They're great and she goes

200
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
Well they're not as good as your friend Greg

201
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
And I was like well Greg uses a bunch of filter apps to like make them look nice

202
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
You should probably add filters

203
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543
That's it like we we just need to be able to make people feel

204
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
Their photos are worthy of sharing

205
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
And I remember going back right from the beach I sat in the room with the little dial-up connection that's the little Hacienda

206
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
And I I literally just like

207
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
Research how to make the first filter

208
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,559
Which ended up being called X pro2 and if you scroll all the way back on my account

209
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
The very first photo

210
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
There's a Nicole's foot and a little stray dog in Mexico and that's because that day I made expert 2 and I went out to a taco stand

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
For lunch to test it

212
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
And I took that picture and posted it on the Prototype that Mike had given me

213
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
So

214
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
That was kind of that the intersection

215
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Of the ideas

216
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Photos

217
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
And filters and it all came through consumer insight

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
There's just like

219
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
What problem are we solving

220
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
Share something that people love

221
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
And make sure that they feel great sharing

222
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Tosa Hollander

223
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Take from the time you do

224
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Decided to

225
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Move away from Bourbon and then

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Lunch in

227
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,751
It was only eight weeks from the time we had basically sketched it out to when we

228
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
You put it into the Apple Store

229
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
We press launch on

230
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
October 10th

231
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
5 mm

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
10

233
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
And it was like about midnight

234
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
And I

235
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
People just started streaming in

236
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
It was crazy

237
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
It was like like how fast

238
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
The first 24 hours with 25000

239
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
People sign up around the world

240
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Which sounded big to us at the time

241
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Yeah that's incredible what were you expecting that

242
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
No I mean

243
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Couple things that show.

244
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
How naive we were at

245
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Number one

246
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,799
Midnight in San Francisco it's 9 a.m. somewhere

247
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
And we didn't quite realize how Global harvests could be

248
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,759
So turns out everyone who's signing up at the beginning actually lived overseas so when we looked into the database more

249
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Who are they

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
People they all had

251
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Email addresses

252
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Germany

253
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Kong

254
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
And various places around the world

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,815
And before you knew it we actually had overloaded our system and it was a very small naive system it was a single

256
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Computer in it

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,167
Colocation space somewhere in LA

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Yeah it was it was nothing more exhilarating than seeing all those people screaming and nothing more crushing than then see

259
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,407
Are people posting on Twitter on their blocks and sailing

260
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
How to scale like like so Clowney

261
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
We are both I mean at that point like running on zero sleep for 2 days devastated and I was like this is it we've built this

262
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
This great thing and we

263
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Totally messed it up

264
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
And to be clear there's no reason we should

265
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Succeeded

266
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Like I mean the server was just like him

267
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
He was down every other hour and like

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
People just kind of forgave us and they would come back and they would share their photos and

269
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
At the time mobile networks weren't that great either

270
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,895
So people would actually blame their connection and not us which is great

271
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
But

272
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
Those initial weeks I mean

273
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
It was just like

274
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,367
Trial by fire and we had to learn everything on the job and we had so many chances to fail but we just

275
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Kept at it

276
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
And and kept work

277
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
I pulled a bunch of all-nighters

278
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
The amount we learn that first year was crazy

279
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
It was like 5 years of college all in one

280
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
And yes pretty exciting

281
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
And tiring

282
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
How do people even find out about it

283
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
How do they know

284
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Did they should download this

285
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
This app

286
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
So we had this intuition that if you're going to throw a party which

287
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Just kind of what an app launch really is

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
People screaming to the door

289
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
You want the next sort of know

290
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
How they should act and who else is there so one of the things we did was

291
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
We have

292
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
You have a hundred

293
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Invite that

294
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
You can have before you launch your app

295
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
To the Apple store where you can invite people to

296
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
What to try it out and what are we going to use this

297
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Find people

298
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
And we used them a combination of some journalists that we got

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
You know of her

300
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Know the last couple of

301
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
5 years

302
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
In

303
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Just got in the valley

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,591
We also went on the site called dribbble.com which is sort of like

305
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
A place where designers Go and show off their best work

306
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
And we figured

307
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
Photographers might not instantly take to Instagram because like

308
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
They want like super high-resolution or if they have other

309
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Are constraints

310
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
But designers love photography but it's not their main

311
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Job

312
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
So we pick basically but

313
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
The 10 top designers and dribble and we emailed them and some ignored us

314
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Finding some Rebecca

315
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119

316
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
And it has great cuz

317
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Coming in day 1 people who

318
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,823
What explore things get a popular page at the time that show the most popular

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Photos across the whole community

320
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:10,015
Wow you can take that on a phone like we take this for granted a little bit now and have cameras have improved every year

321
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
But I think part of what we showed two people back in 2010 was that there was something really amazing you could do with

322
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Just the phone in your pocket

People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees

341
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
But annuities

342
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,119

Launch

00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
CenterPoint

363
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Investors

364
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Thing under door

365
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
We have said investors Choice office

366
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
We be like trying to keep the servers up and we have someone would like cap on her

367
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Hi I'm so-and-so from

368
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Someone to invest

369
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,087
And partners and I like to take you out for lunch and we're trying to keep this side up

370
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
But we met you know a bunch of people along the way and

371
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
The ones we did make time for we're the ones who are most

372
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Black full of that time

373
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
I knew what we were going through anchor

374
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Help

375
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
2

376
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Very shortly after you launch this thing

377
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
What is valued at in

378
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
More than 20 million dollars

379
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Yeah

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Was I think our first round was like

381
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
I don't remember it was like weed

382
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
You took $89

383
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Financing online

384
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
20 president

385
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
Roughly a 30 million dollar valuation

386
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
There's something

387
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
And I mean again

388
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Attestation lifecycle

389
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Never heard of it

390
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Okay it's worth it

391
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
This is crazy

392
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
I didn't really think much of it I just wanted to get back

393
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Twerking I think Mike felt the same way we were just look so focused on building

394
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
What we're building

395
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
It just like

396
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
It kept growing and

397
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
The question was

398
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
I got in Mike and I are

399
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Every single day worth

400
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
How what scale can a

401
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Just got to and

402
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
I think it really started to hit us

403
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
When we would be out

404
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
And see people using it

405
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
In the real world

406
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
It was kind of cereal over time

407
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
I mean I mean that they deserve that like from the outside the store just seems like

408
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Clear

409
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Linear like

410
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Jumping for

411
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
From success to

412
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Success like it

413
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
EZPawn

414
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Put it up there in

415
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
All this money in the

416
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Stratosphere

417
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
But what are moments in the beginning even even after that initial

418
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Fire.

419
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
And Beyond where you thought

420
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
I mean all the time

421
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Like 3 weeks in

422
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,295
Kevin turned to me and he said Mike I don't know how big is it going to be by think we're on

423
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
Something else I will see and every morning I would wake up

424
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
Expecting that that was the morning that

425
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Bratz doll

426
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
And that was it

427
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:12,191
And if I knew what I know now about metrics and how to measure the weather people are coming back over one day 7 days

428
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
30 day.

429
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
I would actually been I think a lot calmer because I think it would have shown as

430
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Babe that shows now that

431
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,735
People who join Instagram tend to stick around and become more active and that's really exciting that the time I didn't know that other guy that signing up are they

432
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
Can I come back tomorrow like is it all going to change

433
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
And that was sort of an internal worry and externally

434
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
You're as we launched and grew

435
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Became a very competitive space end

436
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
We would see in a company's got announced

437
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
But had

438
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,911
Tens of millions of dollars in Investments even before launching Andre like man like this

439
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
These guys have so much money

440
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
They're going to come in and you know at hakkasan

441
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
Going to be really hard and

442
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
That's the other lesson learned which is

443
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,711
You know your valuation and the amount you raise it can be helpful in building your product but it does absolutely nothing

444
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,063
Make people your end users don't care at all how much money you've raised they care if you're providing some cut

445
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Car value

446
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
I'm in the product

447
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,207
Lesson learned over time that you know you have to earn it everyday

448
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
I'm curious to get your

449
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Your take on

450
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Why it

451
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Continue to grow

452
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
There are a lot of

453
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Cool apps

454
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
That you and I both know that launched

455
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
560

456
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Amazing

457
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
People used

458
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Gone and

459
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,735
There are lots of people who work really hard or really creative a really smart of Amazing Ideas

460
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
And put out a really cool products

461
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
So why

462
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Why do you think Instagram

463
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Survive and thrive

464
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
I think there was this opportunity that we spoke of that

465
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Back in the day that

466
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
People had

467
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
Cameras

468
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
In our pockets

469
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
The first time

470
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
And digital photography was clearly going to be a thing

471
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
But the second that camera got added

472
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
The phone

473
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
And then you had it with you at all

474
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
All times

475
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
And that doesn't mean that you're going to take

476
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
Take photos on it obviously the quality has to be high enough

477
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
But we started the company right at the moment we're like

478
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
The quality of those cameras

479
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Just kind of met up

480
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Point-and-shoots

481
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
And because of that

482
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Everyone starts

483
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Taking photos on the

484
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
The phone

485
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
But they had no place to play

486
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Or if they did it

487
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Card I mean they would look at Facebook

488
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,911
Maybe like well you know like have to upload them like on a desktop or

489
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
I on Twitter like doesn't really showing the timeline

490
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
I'm so they had this problem like there's no place to easily share all these

491
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
All the time

492
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
And we just happened to be the right

493
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Tool for that job

494
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
At the right moment

495
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
And

496
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
We created

497
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
I believe the thing that kept growing was

498
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
We couldn't open now

499
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
We sat down

500
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Very early on

501
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Product design

502
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Oyster sauce okay

503
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
Do we want to be a place where you

504
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Send a friend request

505
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Have to accept it in order

506
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
To see

507
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
Those photos or do we want to be open where anyone

508
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Unfollow anyone

509
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
I'm so glad we ended up

510
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Choosing the open model

511
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Because now

512
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
You can follow someone

513
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
From Japan

514
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
You can follow

515
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
You know a chef from New York City

516
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,711
You can file your favorite celebrity or you can call your friends

517
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
And not like hadn't really been done before in

518
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
In photos if you look at

519
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Every photo service

520
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Before then

521
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
It was basically a closed only

522
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Friend's only Network

523
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
And we were the first ones

524
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Really open that

525
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
The other was a moment

526
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
In my other radio show the TED Radio Hour

527
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Where

528
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
PPL be like

529
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Just how big

530
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
The show

531
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Became when when pink

532
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
The pop singer

533
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
He's about to shut we like wholly

534
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
She looks like

535
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
She was in the shower

536
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Did you guys have a moment we were like

537
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Jesus like

538
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
They're using this thing that we built in like our basement

539
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
I think for me

540
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,879
The biggest one was the White House or obamacare's Obama join first

541
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Legos part of

542
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Champagne

543
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
That he was running and

544
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
I remember like

545
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
Instagram isn't enough how to use it and I remember

546
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
You know every

547
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,727
You know every time somebody is using our appetite either see or hear about a mic

548
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
Hope it doesn't crash I hope it works perfectly

549
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
I hope they like don't have any question

550
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
Keep them from using at so that was I think it a big infection moment and I think the other one was

551
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,551
I noticed that the New York Times when they would cover his head stop saying Instagram,

552
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
The photo-sharing app and then it was just

553
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,464
Instagram Aiko we are we have now reached the point where they they can assume that most of their readers

554
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Know what we are

555
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
I am

556
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
I am old enough to remember when in PRC

557
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Would say

558
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Google

559
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,264
For me is I feel embarrassed because you had a really good example about like the president using

560
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
For me it was like our first celebrity of Snoop

561
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Do you remember Snoop Dogg signing up

562
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
I meant we were like

563
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,016
Is this actually Snoop Dogg and then I got an email that was like Snoop Dogg's people want to meet you guys and everything

564
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Oh my gosh

565
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
I don't even know what does it mean people like

566
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Snoop Dogg has people

567
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,184
And I remember Justin Bieber signing up and

568
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
And the world going kind of

569
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Bonkers

570
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
For that is why my world I mean

571
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
Teenage girls and

572
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
They basically started using the app incessant

573
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Took off with like

574
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
A bunch of really young people as well

575
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
You obviously everybody knows

576
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Eventually you sold

577
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Instagram to Facebook

578
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Billion dollar

579
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
I mean

580
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Incredible that

581
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
2 years

582
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Greatest thing

583
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
That happen

584
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
You couldn't have planned for that you couldn't have

585
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
Even have been in that mission

586
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah I mean the first day

587
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
That we went home

588
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
After pulling that all nighter to launch Instagram

589
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
There's a guy sitting on the muni here in San

590
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Subway system

591
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
And

592
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
He was using Instagram

593
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,360
Oh my God like we did it like someone in the world is using this thing out in the wild

594
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,224
That feeling and that moment is the currency that you maximize

595
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
When you're not

596
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
It's like seeing someone using your product

597
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
And loving it is like way more rewarding

598
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
The Nanny amount of money

599
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
In the world

600
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,584
You guys now or within the Facebook

601
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Family right

602
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
An independent

603
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
Company that you are part of Facebook

604
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
How to change the way

605
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
You are obviously a lot bigger yeah

606
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Initially that was actually

607
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Pretty awesome because

608
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
We had all these problems killing our services in like

609
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
The Facebook infrastructure

610
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,040
Come over and we seen that before here this is what you do

611
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,600
So I made our lives actually a lot better

612
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
And we were able to hire some of the best

613
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
On the world end

614
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,560
And share Talon I like the colors of the older brother or the other sibling where were the we were the first company that Facebook

615
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Fire dancer

616
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
Kept running and then since then you've seen Oculus

617
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Send WhatsApp

618
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
And

619
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
I think a lot of things that we figured out early on and turn

620
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Terms of the relationship

621
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
The office space

622
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Hiring

623
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
And I think we

624
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Off

625
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
From both sides of the

626
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Of the table I purchased it from

627
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,272
A spirit of hate how can we make Instagram better through these Integrations rather than

628
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,600
How can you make Instagram more like Facebook in or try to

629
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Adapted to be exactly

630
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
There was this

631
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
This controversy that happened

632
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
With Instagram where

633
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
You change the terms of service and people aren't

634
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
The impression that their photos were

635
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Your property in

636
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
A lot of people like

637
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Black Instagram

638
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Moment

639
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Presently that I mean that's

640
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
That was a

641
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
Learning lesson for Feud for you guys

642
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Huge lesson

643
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Number one

644
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
People read the docs that

645
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
You know

646
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
You put out an

647
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
You should care about them as a

648
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,696
The founder so your terms of service basically what happened we had these terms of service that we had

649
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,328
I think effectively copied from some other site way back in the day and just find and replace their name with

650
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Instagram because we're a startup we didn't know what we were doing

651
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,704
But we eventually got to a place

652
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Where when we join Facebook Facebook is like hey you actually need a real one that like fits with the way you guys work and we're going to make all these

653
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Make changes and we went through it

654
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:53,504
And I was like a great this makes sense and I didn't really read it all that carefully

655
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
And one of the sections

656
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
Reading it again today if I look at it

657
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Can be interpreted that we were going to take

658
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
User photos in somehow use them in advertising

659
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,560
That was definitely not our intention and like no one in the company of evil

660
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
And thought of that idea

661
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,216
It just if you read the sentence that way you could see that maybe it would worry people

662
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
So immediately

663
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
Yeah we had this

664
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Big protest in

665
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
And people were

666
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
You know

667
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
Leaving the service I mean if we have a graph of account deletions at that

668
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
That was skyrocketing

669
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
And Mike and I sat down / like what do we do

670
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
And

671
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:32,160
And we felt helpless and it was like all over that was that first day all over again

672
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
It's like we've screwed this up how do we make sure people know

673
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
I went back to my house like

674
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Why we just apologize and say we're wrong

675
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,936
And I posted this Punk post on our block you can probably still find it online

676
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
And I was like we're sorry like

677
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
We didn't mean this

678
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
That's absolutely not what we're trying to do

679
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
We tweeted about it and actually the graph of

680
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Deletions at that moment

681
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Drops to zero

682
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
And sometimes you just have to say sorry

683
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
Sometimes you just have to say you were wrong

684
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
And reassert what you're actually trying to do

685
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
I'm at interaction with the

686
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
The community still sex

687
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
And my mind is something

688
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
That we try to do every

689
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Every single day which is

690
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Be really transparent

691
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
People put our community

692
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
81st because like at the end of the day

693
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Without them where a photo-sharing

694
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
How much of what happened

695
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
To you guys

696
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Instagram

697
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
And this whole story how much of it

698
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
I'd say 50%

699
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
Actually I have this thesis that

700
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
The world runs unlock

701
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
The question is what you do with

702
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
Everyone gets lucky for some amount in their life

703
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
No question is are you

704
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Are you alert enough

705
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
To know you're being lucky right or you're

706
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
You're becoming lucky

707
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Are you talented enough to take

708
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Take that advantage and run with it

709
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
And

710
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Do you have enough

711
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Grits do you have enough like

712
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,312
Resilience to stay with it when it gets hard because everyone gets lucky

713
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
In minimum wage every week

714
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,688
Can you find a Dollar on the ground or you know you got a break at work to work on

715
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
Project are you meet someone really interesting

716
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
The difference between people I think

717
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
If you succeed in the long run and the Pea

718
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
People don't is frankly that often isn't that like

719
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
You got lucky and now it's yours too

720
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Yours to make awesome

721
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,608
And that first day I think we got lucky by having the right ideas the right time

722
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
The right place we we were lucky to have met each other I mean

723
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
There are a lot of co-founding Paris

724
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
Intact who have not worked out and Mike and I are like great friends

725
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Least I think so right Mike

726
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
And

727
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
The question is

728
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,600
Can you take that lock and capitalize on it

729
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger by the way

730
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
After the sale of Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars those two became very very rich

731
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
