It was the call that none of us could imagine ever wanted to get a pint of ice cream in Lincoln Nebraska

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
Is it positive for Listeria so we decided that we're going to recall everything

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
That 265 tons of ice cream in the world came back to us

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
And there we were did you think there's a possibility that you would shut down that your business could basic

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
I think at that point we realize that that was it and it was weird because

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,640
All the time just like I don't even have any ideas

33
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Interesting little fact about

34
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
The Columbus Ohio area

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
It's actually one of the major food incubators in America

Max & Erma's

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Yes in Columbus

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
And what are the theories about why that is

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Is because for a long time the population of Columbus was a

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
Pretty good proxy for the general population of the United

43
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
States

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
So if

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
People in

46
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Columbus liked it

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
It was a good chance that the rest of America would two

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
If you know this

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
It kind of makes sense that ice cream flavors like

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
Juniper and lemon curd or

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Osmanthus

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Blackberry crackle whatever that is

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Have also come out of Columbus

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Because that

00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936

Oliver weird and

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Wonderful ice cream

60
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,200
It's an ice cream brand that could only have come from the mind of a perfume maker which as you will hear

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Was almost with Jenny became

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,136
I recently went to Columbus to meet Jenny and we chatted in front of a live audience

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
To be honest

64
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
It kind of felt like they all knew Jenny persols

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Do right

66
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
It feels a little bit like you're like your your bar mitzvah

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Is everyone who knows you

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
I know every single one of you

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Let's start at the

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
You moved around a lot as a

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
A kid what is your

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Parents do

73
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
That meant that you guys moved around a lot

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
I don't know they got bored

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
My mom could ask her

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
She got they got they we moved

77
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
And it wasn't very far

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
But we would move to a new school

79
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
Yeah so from the time I can remember we went to New School almost every year every couple of years

80
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
And

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
I don't know it didn't bother me

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,320
But even in Peoria Illinois where I started out we went

83
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
To several schools

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
There and I moved here when I was 12

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
What do you remember about

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,024
Like did you remember feeling unsettled you remember feeling that

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Do you know

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
You didn't have stability as a kid

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,471
No I don't I don't feel I didn't feel that the funny thing is I'm a parent now and I wouldn't do that to my kids

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,079
I mean I was also very shy and fairly introverted

91
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
You know you think that that would be you know that would be horrible to have to go start in a new school and find new friends every year

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Where to but

93
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,903
I don't really remember it being that way in fact when I moved to Dublin Ohio I moved from a small town

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
Call Dunlap Illinois I think the population was like 500

95
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
1985 I went to orientation

96
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
In summer before school started

97
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,983
And there were 40 other kids there in the whole grade came out to like

98
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
You know just to greet me and say

99
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Welcome

100
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
To Dublin

101
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
But it turns out it was just a new kids

102
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
For 7th grade

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
In Dublin Ohio Ellen was going through a big boom then so you say you said you were interpreted as a

104
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Kid how do you think

105
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
Someone would have described you I'm with

106
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Is that how

107
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
Like a grown-up or describe you like our Jenny she's really quiet over there said

108
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
She's going to make it one

109
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
No they would have said

110
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
So kind and patient

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Quiet

112
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
Rule follower all the things that I'm not

113
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Really

114
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
And so I have read that like even as a kid

115
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,927
You were like already hustling like you were selling

116
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
Plastic straws filled with powdered Kool-Aid and sugar and selling them as Pixies

117
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
The true yeah one of my very successful businesses

118
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
I had three other people selling

119
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
M to in

120
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,175
We were selling them all over the school I went to a big school then

121
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
And did you go to high school here in Columbus

122
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
I didn't get my last couple of years at a Burlington High School

123
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And so you must have been

124
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,695
Okay I'm pretty good cuz you got into Ohio State University right

125
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,327
By the time I got up early so I was very good at figuring out how exactly to get

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Tracy's

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Like

128
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
I knew exactly what I had to do cuz I always filled math

129
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
I threw it out

130
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
I just didn't even bother

131
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
Because then I would go to summer school and I can get an A

132
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
And they would merge the two grades

133
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Together

134
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,527
And other things in the evening and that was great

135
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
So how did you get the

136
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
They were

137
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
Pretty sure that I wasn't going to get into college the guidance counselors because I also refuse to take the SAT I really

138
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,935
I thought that was horrible I still think that's horrible, it's horrible

139
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
You can't judge people by that kind of stuff it's just not right

140
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
So

141
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,687
They wanted me to do it but you know what that takes six weeks in a class that cost $350

142
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
And I have things to do

143
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
So we're going to Ohio State so of course I applied to Ohio State

144
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
And they said no thanks

145
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
But I wrote him a letter

146
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
I was just like what okay I know you like I get it but

147
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
Here's what I was doing

148
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
While I was not getting

149
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Good rates

150
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
And the next thing I knew I got a letter in the study of I was accepted to a state fall quarter

151
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
Can you get too high

152
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
First aid and you

153
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Video arcade

154
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
You get to the Ohio State

155
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
And you you decide to study art history

156
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
So yummy

157
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
I started in our because I always on her because my grandmother was not as my mom was very end.

158
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,191
I was I always hanging out in the art department at school

159
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
And then I was blown away by art history

160
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Like not

161
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Off my feet because

162
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
It was like a real

163
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,503
Like emotional look at what really happened versus history being with other people

164
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Decided history would be

165
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
I would go to art history classes

166
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
And my brain felt like it was on a treadmill I wouldn't leave

167
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Out of breath

168
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,375
I guess it was why you were a student that you started get into like making your own perfume

169
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
I did it was a creative time for me I was trying to figure out what I was going to become

170
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Also

171
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
True that when you study art and art history

172
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Mostly

173
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,663
I'm everybody in your life wants to know what you're really going to do

174
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
So you get bombarded with that question which isn't fair but

175
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
You know

176
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
So I was working at a pastry shop and I was thinking about maybe quitting school and going to pastry school I knew I would have a business one day.

177
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
You already knew that when you were a suit

178
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Yeah

179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
That was where I was headed

180
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,679
And then I got into perfume vials of sin

181
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,287
Like spearmint or one that kind of smell like

182
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Tarragon or whatever

183
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
So then I got really into sex I'm late

184
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,967
I'm really into that and I was good at sent and I knew sent from my

185
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Childhood

186
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
That got me really inappropriate I think I should be perfumer

187
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
And at the time

188
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
That didn't for me mean

189
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,047
So I should probably send it for some chemistry classes that wasn't what it meant for me what it meant for me was I need to go to the

190
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
The travel agency and see if I can get a one-way ticket to Grasse France

191
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,727
Perfect and hustle and figure out somebody to help me and then I'll learn all that stuff and

192
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
You know I'll be coming

193
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031

194
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
And that would be great

195
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:56,735
Go to the travel agency and you get a ticket to grass in France right and

196
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
No I didn't do that okay I didn't do that again I didn't do that

197
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
So I'm so I'm doing that that's for that's okay so that's where I went when you're doing in my house

198
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279

00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Yeah yeah as rain the most

200
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
I'm telling you I was giving away and I

201
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
I never couple years ago at a few books on there then

202
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,103
And then I have this one essential oil that was oil Cayenne that doesn't have a scent at all just has physical

203
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
Heat on your tongue so I was one of you got to cook with

204
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Essential oils to Road

00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
Read me the news

207
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Motion to some chocolate ice cream

208
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Like from your freezer

209
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Why was Botham I didn't have any

210
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
Oil into my

211
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
How can I stream

212
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Does going to make a spicy

213
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Frozen

214
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
And so I did that and it was

215
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
It was incredible so I took a bite and it

216
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
It was cold in the

217
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,199
Taste of the sugar in the chocolate in like a few seconds later

218
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Heat

219
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
And it was a first video

220
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Ice cream

221
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Hot thing I thought it was like

222
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Amazing so

223
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,511
Amelia me to rose petal ice cream with vanilla and started to think like

224
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Ice cream is the perfect carrier

225
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
I've sent these oils right

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
This really quickly making different

227
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Edible perfume in a way

228
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Your ice cream you were buying like

229
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Pint of Haagen-Dazs or whatever

230
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
And that she didn't

231
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Experimenting

232
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
Yep and

233
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
How to make my eyes

234
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Maybe

235
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
2 weeks later

236
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
Wow this is like

237
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
And did you know how to make ice cream in a bakery so you had some

238
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Skills bug

239
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Did you know

240
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
How to Star Wars start

241
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
I did not

242
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
Do Cuisinart canister ice cream machine that you have on me about it

243
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
For this

244
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,455
Project I am really like taking that much as a

245
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
And I should put that into some kind of because I like all desserts

246
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
So ice cream was just on the bottom

247
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Right before cookies all cookies

248
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
I like ice I like ice cream I just didn't

249
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Love ice cream

250
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
And how long before you were making decent ice cream cuz I have to assume like

251
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
You suck

252
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,935
Well now I would say it all was horrible

253
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
The first of all

254
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
The when I put the essential oils into the ice creams

255
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,895
Like I knew and I had one of those moments that

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
You read about

257
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
We're like the sky opened up

258
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,039
And I knew that I was going to make ice cream for the rest of my life

259
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
And I think that the reason it happened is because

260
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,719
Has I've been studying all the things that interested me and this is exactly where they all converge

261
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
I understood that butterfat meltable old body temperature because

262
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,887
I was working with other fast the perfumers off and use van

263
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Emilio contractor skin

264
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
And so I knew that but if I was kind of a pet

265
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
And that ice cream with a perfect carrier of scent

266
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Could tell stories because I've been thinking about that

267
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
From an art perspective

268
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,367
And then I knew a little bit about pastry because I've been working in pastry shop in the pastry kitchen and thinking about that so those things kind of crossed over

269
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
In ice cream

270
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
End

271
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
I didn't know what I need to do I thought I knew what I needed to do what I needed

272
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
I quit at school and go

273
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Do it

274
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,703
I guess it was around 1996 when you did that you actually dropped out of

275
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
OU Ohio State

276
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
City University

277
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
2

278
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
What you do at an ice cream store which is kind of

279
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Crazy

280
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
How was like a mentally that you took

281
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
How to say all right you know what time dropout

282
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
And

283
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
What was actually really easy because I was in a figure drawing class near three hours

284
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
And

285
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
I'm a model watching that I always had trouble drawing

286
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
And

287
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,543
She's like tall and beautiful and Andrew angular and so had and I couldn't get good work when I

288
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Withdraw her

289
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,871
And so I was like I was just deflated

290
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
And

291
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
I sat there I just want to go home and make ice cream

292
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
So I did I just

293
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Shut up

294
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,135
And left I left all it was portfolio week unless all of my art there that I had done I left all of my supplies there

295
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,535
Those are expensive if you know anybody is an artist or studies are at those works but you work hard to get those supplies

296
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
I mean at that point did you

297
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Good enough

298
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Add ice cream making

299
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
How did you

300
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
What was your next act like how did you even have the money

301
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
Open up a shop to

302
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Make a business

303
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,295
What was it you had a friend and so she and I were were messing around with this together and

304
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
And she was able to get all of it from Paris

305
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
South County

306
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
So we are

307
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
So that was actually the easy part

308
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
For that one

309
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,375
And I started stalking the North Market we started going to North Park is an indoor Public Market

310
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
In Columbus

311
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,031
And you you went to them and said hey I want to get a contract with you to have a stall or

312
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
Yeah because the market had just moved into a brand new

313
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
Bigger space than what it had been in Advent in a quonset hut for many years

314
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
3 weeks are going there and you know they were just not into it they are just not into it all day or very they wanted

315
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,255
The market to be a grocery destination in Columbus

316
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
And I screamed it didn't fit at all

317
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
Without Vision that they have the market at all

318
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Three-step going back

319
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
New casino

320
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Really

321
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
There was a show on

322
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,615
Pedia is the Turning Point the show there was a show on PBS

323
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,455
About eyes are there another one about sandwiches they had a couple of different shows they put out

324
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,271
And they're really good and on the ice cream show

325
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Showcase

326
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
A company called facets

327
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
At the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia

328
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
And the Heritage amazing ice cream company

329
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
And they started right there in the market needs to have a thriving business in the market

330
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
And I I had to call my grandfather to have him

331
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Record this on the VCR

332
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Haha

333
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,847
In Florida because apparently I didn't know anybody with VCR I don't know

334
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
But that was what I did

335
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,503
Anyway he recorded it and send it to us and that was how we got in the market because they watched

336
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
That and realize that a nice ring company can be a thriving part of a part with writing Market

337
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
To you go to the North Market

338
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
In Columbus

339
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,815
And what you set up a stand and you guys call it scream

340
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Ice cream ice cream ice cream

341
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Bring it in

342
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
An enso

343
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,079
And if I like was it already we are doing weird and unusual flavors was actually chocolate vanilla strawberry

344
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Your first few flavors

345
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
David Carroll

346
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
Was was one of her sons of Wildberry lavender

347
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,343
Fly the flavors that we do now that courses hot chocolate one

348
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
And then I start using ingredients from the market

349
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
To send in flavored ice cream so we would have

350
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Bye-bye

351
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,839
Basil or some herb from the farmer outside and then use that

352
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Deep in the cream

353
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,215
And cream would absorb all of that sends when you lock it in there when it's frozen and then

354
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
Wizard of unfurling your palette

355
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,639
If we went back in time 20 years and try that ice cream would it taste exactly like it

356
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,967
They said it wouldn't it would it was

357
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Some of the flavors would be similar Celtic Carol was was similar

358
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
But it was in the in the body and texture the ocean that I wasn't able to get right

359
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
So what do people make of you guys at

360
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,327
At this stop and you because you are a super young and kind of

361
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Like

362
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Alternative lights

363
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
Take care most the time and I were

364
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Gucci outfits and

365
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
A lot of vintage stuff and

366
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
I thought it was cool I thought it was like

367
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
I thought it was like the artist making ice cream and it's funny looking back on that too because I like whenever you like I never got to the artist Park

368
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
Like I was studying art you know I mean I never even did that

369
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
You know

370
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,463
But I just thought that was cool that's like a cool business you you know

371
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
Did you something different everyday

372
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
And people will come in and be

373
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Just so excited to see what you're doing that day

374
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,775
Not how we that's not like what a business assistant

375
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
How even I

376
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Approach businesses

377
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
I mean did you get

378
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
Lots of great feedback I mean what was it was a lot of Buzz around a lot of Buzz around it

379
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
Maybe a little bit in the beginning

380
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,463
You know some people in the market you know when would come by and they liked our ice creams but you know we had $9 days

381
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
I think the worst day ever had a $3 day

382
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Well that might have been

383
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
I mean one ice cream cone

384
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
Yep we barely got by but we did

385
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,847
I made $630 a month for the entire time we were open I took that home to live off of

386
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
For those 3 4 years

387
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
I'm into you say I mean cuz you're selling ice cream all day and you're making it all night there and that's

388
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
Stop making it all day selling it all day

389
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
It was great I mean it was great for for a long time it was really great I would wander the market

390
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Talk to Merchants I got to learn about everything that they do I learn from the cheesy Isle about cheese the Wine Guy All About Wine a lot

391
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:28,895
Are the markets only busy when it's busy and it's not busy so I learned a lot I learned everything I know about food and learn.

392
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
What do you know about business and

393
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
People in

394
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
I'm all those days and I wouldn't sell it over the counter and learn how people reacted to

395
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
To it and did it

396
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
Feel to you like you were flailing or did it feel to you like it was

397
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
It was kind of working

398
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
The first years it felt like it was about to work

399
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
And then it started to feel like we were flailing

400
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:57,567
Yeah and then it started to feel like you know I don't know that this is ever going to work I don't know that my business partner is going to be really into this

401
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
Really wasn't your kind of gone the whole time she wasn't there

402
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
You know and I don't know that I have it in me to do this forever like

403
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,879
I guess it at around this time it's like between 2000-2002 you decided to take

404
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
And ice cream course at Penn State which is

405
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
A famous horse Ben & Jerry's that that's how they learn how to make ice cream

406
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
It did by correspondence

407
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Why do that right before we close scream

408
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,167
Which doesn't make it a whole lot of sense

409
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
You got shut screen down

410
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,775
The same month I went to Penn State ice cream School

411
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
I mean you've been making asking for 4 years so why did you feel like you needed to take

412
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
But ice cream course

413
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
I felt like I wanted to know

414
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
How

415
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
It's everybody else does it

416
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,463
That's that that's where I got a lot of it I mean because I've been doing it for 4 years when I went to Penn State it was like all of these

417
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
This intuition that I had

418
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Was suddenly

419
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
Knowledge that I now knew right

420
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
It was not just intuition I know had that

421
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
And so it was like I got it you know

422
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
And it was wonderful to because you know ice cream is all math

423
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
Math in chemistry and science

424
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
That is

425
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,039
Just not at all what I did when I was younger and that was really cool being in that environment and seeing

426
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,367
And these people put these things together and see ice cream the Lavin

427
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
Really close really what is your

428
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
Friends say what your mom said you was she like you know

429
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
Maybe you should you know I something else and where the people who were saying

430
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Do you know this respondent

431
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Great

432
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
But maybe she gets made before stable

433
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
That's pretty much what everybody said

434
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
In a minute

435
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,016
@jenny decided to completely ignore everyone's advice

436
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
And then resurrect her ice cream company

437
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160

Special LIVE edition

448
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
How I built

449
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Best from NPR

450
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Harrah's

451
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,536
Okay so it's the year 2000

452
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Scream ice cream

453
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,376
Is no more at the North Market

454
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Jenny's out of work

455
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
But still she

456
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Can't accept the idea of

457
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
Totally abandoning ice cream

458
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,128
Is it felt like a really long time for me but it's probably 6 months

459
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
Before I started writing another plan

460
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
To make ice cream

461
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,272
And when what was it was it just people saying waiting to get back to

462
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Doing it

463
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:25,952
One of the things that really struck me when I was in that in-between time when I was really sort of

464
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
In limbo of where it what I was going to do

465
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
What was the moment that I was on a Saturday I'd saved like I had like $5 I had a Vogue magazine was going to a coffee shop

466
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
And I was really excited to get her Orange

467
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
And like that was in my whole Saturday

468
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
I went in there and I spent a long line I got to the front and I was like I don't have the orange scone and coffee

469
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Redstone

470
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
They didn't care

471
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,352
And I just like kind of bandwidth line over the stove perfectly it back to East Moline

472
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,960
And like a line is still there and all these people are so excited or whatever and I wasn't anymore and I turn around I walk

473
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
Out with nothing to do but when I walk through the door

474
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
It like

475
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Hit me

476
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
Like that is exactly what I was doing to all of my customers at scream

477
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,504
Because it's cream I would only have whatever I want to make every day and so yeah I knew that like

478
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
Everyone loves salted caramel but like I can't make it everyday

479
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,672
And so once I realized that

480
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
The thing that draws me back to a business

481
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Every single time

482
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,328
Then I went to businesses is the thing that I had last time

483
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,192
But it's always

484
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
That changed everything for me

485
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
And once I once I swear I got that

486
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
I think

487
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
Everything in my life started changing I think I

488
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,712
I start raining this man nearly just knew we had to do you know I like

489
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,576
And then it started to kind of snapping a place like all the mistakes that I had made it scream really coming into Focus

490
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,184
You needed money

491
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
To start this business and you needed a location

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
So how did you

493
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
How did you do that

494
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144
Of course I was hoping we get back in the North Market because

495
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,776
It would be difficult to imagine my company if the market

496
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Didn't exist

497
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,432
I mean you can start up there pretty fairly inexpensively $34,000

498
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,320
And you've got too many people walking through every year like Pike's Place in Seattle

499
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
Reading Terminal in Philadelphia

500
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
That is how important or North Market is in Columbus

501
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Yeah

502
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,096
Yeah and it's them it's in the middle of the city and everybody goes there and all the highways lead to the North Market

503
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
So I was hoping to to get back in the market

504
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
And I got a job in the market

505
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
And started hanging out in the market all the time

506
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
They're talking everybody the market

507
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
Get to know all the management

508
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
And just trying to change you know just said to change the way they were

509
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
And he let me in

510
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
Cuz I thought of you as I guess somebody who

511
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Tried and failed monkey kid you know who

512
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
Maybe wasn't entrepreneur real real business person or whatever when you went back to them you said hey I want to open up an ice cream shop where they like yeah

513
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Come back

514
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
Oh no not at all no

515
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
No

516
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
What they say

517
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Piano

518
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
We're not we're not doing that again

519
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
It was a lot of nose

520
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
And and for how long

521
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
I don't know but at least a year I would think

522
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Yeah

523
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
So how did you convince him how did you get

524
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
The market to

525
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
Accept your new iteration of

526
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
What started making ice cream

527
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
And

528
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
Imitate you're taking it

529
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,096
Market at that point Charlie had gotten me this machine Charlie was your boyfriend at

530
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
The time that your husband

531
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
He's on my husband's

532
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
And Charlie buy me this machine that I couldn't

533
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Afford it was like a $1,200

534
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
Italian gelato machine

535
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:59,200
And and I was trying to say for it because I had these friends who I wanted to invest in the company

536
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,760
And they're really the only thing I do with money

537
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
So and I was their babysitter

538
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,904
And so I

539
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:15,072
But they were great they were just wonderful and I and I was very close to them and so I told him about the ice cream or whatever

540
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
And I wanted to get them ice cream soup

541
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm so they can give me money

542
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,728
And I couldn't get the Sanchez couldn't save up or end they were going to move to

543
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
To Toronto

544
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,152
And so became urgent that I get this machines that I can show them what I'm doing so I can get the $40,000 in them

545
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
And I went home one day and Charlie had bought it

546
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
For me and

547
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:38,624
So then I'm back in business as much as I possibly can at home I get a little

548
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,952
Sears freezer whatever that can make him fill up

549
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
Getting it all over anyone I could tow it would take it back to the market I would put it on the desk

550
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,984
Upstairs

551
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
So

552
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,896
The restaurants that I've been working with where would find out about at 7 after the restaurant started

553
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
Carrying my sweet just making it at home

554
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Making like

555
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Oh's Memphis

556
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,768
What I have discovered

557
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,960
So the market knows that I'm doing that the people that Michael knew I was doing this and I was doing everything I could just to get everybody to have this ice cream

558
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
And then you would have plan and

559
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
And they've said yes

560
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,920
Well they did I don't remember what came first if we had to get the loan first

561
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
You need that money

562
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Ensure that makes good money

563
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
YouTube

564
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Did you get that

565
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Well

566
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Family the rights that I

567
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Was babysitting for a nanny for

568
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Pitch the idea to them they love the ice

569
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
We'd love to offer you the money

570
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
And I was like oh my goodness

571
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
And they're like butt

572
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Don't take it

573
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Because if you take it we will own

574
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
So much of your company right now

575
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
And

576
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,992
Just do everything you can for it'll be here for you were going to be in Toronto but it'll be here for you if you need it

577
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
Charlie Charlie like thought I was going to get the money that night

578
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
I don't know man I haven't like this they said yes but they said no and like

579
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,792
You know

580
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
What if we went to the bank together

581
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,656
Like maybe we can get this together like maybe we can get

582
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
A loan from the bank on the SBA

583
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
To you lunch as Jenny's

584
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,640
Was it called Jeni's Splendid ice cream

585
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
And you're back in business at the market

586
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
And what was the reaction

587
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
At that point

588
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Well it was

589
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:49,696
Wonderful we opened on a Michigan game Saturday which around here is kind of a big deal

590
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,536
Means that nobody else has anywhere but you know watching the game and what

591
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
What changed about

592
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Your hole

593
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Approach

594
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
And in Jenny's versus Scream I mean did you

595
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,288
Did you look different as you dress different ways are different aesthetic

596
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,848
There were a lot of things that were different

597
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
First of all I I had

598
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Two different dipping cake cases so that I had big signature flavors on one side and then I vowed like I'll never be a

599
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Salted caramel again

600
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
And other flavors that were I knew people really love that I'd like hit that I was good at that were working

601
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
And another side that was just for ice creams of the Season or at my whim or

602
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,800
Whatever inspired by pop culture history whatever I wanted to do and then the other thing I did was I

603
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
Determined

604
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,712
If this was going to work I had seen failure and I didn't want to do it again

605
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,552
So I like cut my hair short I dyed it

606
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Darker than my natural color which is not

607
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Which is like dark blonde hair with light brown

608
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
And I had

609
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Star sweatshirt

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
And jeans and like a starch apron everyday

611
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Cub pharmacy Lakeville

612
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Like got into character I get called a shopkeeper

613
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Like

614
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
Wood

615
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
Was obsessed with old photographs I would buy them on eBay

616
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,920
I saw I love them like I just collect them like really old old photographs of Lights

617
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
People doing fun things in Victorian era or whatever

618
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
And

619
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,856
There's always there always has photographs of like a shopkeeper outside with a broom in there wearing like

620
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:26,208
That's what I'm doing from now on that

621
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,048
And in doing that what I did was and on purpose I knew it

622
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,120
Take all of them is actually off of me and put it on ice

623
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
And that was what was

624
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Different

625
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
So is it when you had pink hair and you were wearing for

626
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
Thrift Shop clothes you think people judge the ice-cream differently

627
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
I always thought it was a whole package

628
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,576
It was

629
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,440
If I'm going there was a food critic in town that wasn't very real excited about scream

630
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
And I was like if I'm going to get him

631
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
2

632
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
Take me seriously

633
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
I need to be somebody that he would take Serious

634
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
And so

635
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
I dressed up

636
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Part

637
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
And it works

638
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,312
I mean it totally works the same ice cream he hated before

639
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:24,064
So you are back in business back at the North Market in a starched white shirt

640
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
And did it take off

641
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
Yeah I mean from opening day we had a line that went down the market and and even out the like

642
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Glassdoor

643
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
I mean it was pretty incredible

644
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:41,216
That first day when it was Michigan game Saturday and we knew that

645
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
This is it this is going to

646
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
Be better

647
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
And luckily to

648
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Within that first

649
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
Year

650
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
Charlie's brother from Nashville moved up

651
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
To join the company

652
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,416
And that was wonderful so then it became kind of the three of us actually the two of us for a long time

653
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,816
Doing that so Tom quit his job moved up here to join our company which was really special and wonderful and

654
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Incident at buganda

655
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
Former partnership

656
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Apus Ramona nasty

657
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
About the actual

658
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Ice cream because a lot of people think of

659
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Premium ice cream as like

660
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
As a custard based ice cream

661
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Mike French

662
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Vanilla right witcha

663
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Egg base

664
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
And your ice cream was an egg base you were

665
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
You're using cream and

666
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
And milk

667
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
Yeah and it was it was from that who I was

668
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
I was

669
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
Working with a dairy and I was using kind of a

670
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
I was because I was

671
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,560
Stabilizers in milk and cream and all the kids

672
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Standardized format how to figure that part of it out yet understanding you so

673
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,264
What would differentiate dry skin where the was a

674
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Really

675
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Flavor

676
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
Yeah at that point was really the flavor is

677
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,736
What was your ambition at that point it's it's now 2002-2003

678
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
You're back in business it's a different look

679
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
Were you already thinking ten years ahead saying

680
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
I want this to be

681
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Big I want this to be

682
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,536
The biggest ice cream in America or were you thinking

683
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
I was thinking the same thought that I had at that moment that I first aid ice cream back in 1996 which is exact same thought I have now which is that we

684
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,520
I want to set the standard for American ice cream the American ice cream can be so much better that it's

685
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
The best ice cream in the world when it's made

686
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
I don't know that I knew really how

687
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Big or what

688
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
That was but I just knew that

689
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
That was a we're going to do

690
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
I guess you had a turning point in 2005 you get

691
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
A visit from

692
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,048
Estate regulator who says actually you're not supposed to be making ice cream hear you

693
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
You have a license

694
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
What what happened with this if you want to make ice cream sold over-the-counter your you're governed by your ETA to permit from your local

695
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Health Partners

696
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,896
Ice cream and sell it to somebody else to resell you then or you then move to the state

697
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Agricultural

698
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Department

699
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
I didn't know that

700
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
So

701
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,344
We are making a Sims and they were selling a couple restaurants and so he came over

702
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
You're really not supposed to

703
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Do that

704
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
So early okay

705
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
So now what the hell ya

706
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Well he gave us to know all of the information that we needed to figure out what kind of a kitchen when you realize that we needed to

707
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
Open a brand new ice cream

708
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,056
Production facility cuz you were making all your ice cream at the market

709
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
See you at 2

710
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,152
Basically start making ice cream in another kitchen

711
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
How are you able to

712
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Pay for that

713
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
It was actually pretty terrifying because

714
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
We knew pretty quickly that

715
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
The business we had said it wasn't going to be enough to pay for

716
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Disney production kitchen

717
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Facility

718
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
And so

719
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
We immediately started thinking about another location

720
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
Dallas pay for that and that was our Grandview location interior

721
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
Columbus integrate walkable neighborhood

722
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616
So we went to the bank with both of those projects

723
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
We had some

724
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
Proof that we could do it

725
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,064
And they gave us the loan but it was a lot of money I mean it might have been $250,000

726
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,672
That was a frightening time because we open Grandview not knowing

727
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:17,024
Is anybody knew who you were if anybody would come and I've been sort of scared of having a

728
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
Door you know we're in the market and that is beautiful

729
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Environment

730
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,496
So essentially this this Regulators visit to you is what resulted in your expansion

731
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
You had to open up

732
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,128
Absolutely we were three years old and

733
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
That wasn't on our radar at all

734
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
So it was really in the

735
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,832
Beginning it was you and Charlie husband your brother-in-law Tom

736
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,440
And you're growing right I mean sort of slow but steady

737
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
No one's getting rich at all at the

738
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
This point

739
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,096
I guess in 2009 you decided

740
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
You guys need to add

741
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
Someone with more business Acumen to

742
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
To join the company

743
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeah

744
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:04,128
I I we've had conversations about it and I definitely knew that we needed a CEO that was our thing

745
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,688
And so we would use it with his friend John

746
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
Who is drink with a lot after

747
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
Long day of making ice cream

748
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:16,160
Who is our attorney friend but like in the beginning of his career in the beginning of what we were doing

749
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,208
And we got to know him very well and we know

750
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,328
So everything that I would start talk about who's the CEO of you like you know what it's like somebody exactly like John

751
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
But at that point John had moved on from being an attorney here in Columbus and he was now at GE and doing great

752
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
Just like his career sailing

753
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
And so Charlie's on the couch were at home and he like

754
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,944
Into message Johnny's like he John you know it we're trying to hire a CEO and

755
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
Like we want to pick your brain about that could be easily won her somebody just like you

756
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
But we're going to pick your brain

757
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
So that you can maybe help us figure out how to

758
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
I not person

759
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
And then John was like going on

760
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
But it was soon

761
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
There's some point within the next two weeks

762
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
He

763
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Quit his job

764
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
GM

765
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
We got to be our CEO

766
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Why would you take such a leaf

767
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Of faith I mean

768
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
He's right over there you go

769
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,200
He was he had a pretty good job to use pie making

770
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
A lot of cash and he's going to a company that

771
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Like first one

772
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Did you offer him

773
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
Kind of money that he was making at the time

774
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
No

775
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
And

776
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
And actually his first job was to make his own salary

777
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
You know what I don't know I mean I think that one of the things that

778
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Was just

779
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Such

780
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,688
I guess luck for us for the three of us or Charlie and me and John is just that we knew each other

781
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
We spent too much time together and

782
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
We trusted each other

783
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
You know and there is something about

784
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
That

785
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
Was John

786
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Was he sort of looking at other

787
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
Distribution that I was he looking at supermarkets and other places we were working with Dina.

788
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
Luka at we we we been in working with them for

789
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
Maybe a couple years

790
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
And I

791
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,568
And that was the beginning of our Star Grocery business

792
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,224
And so when John came and he kind of use that as a platform to them continues to really to begin growing that which helped pay for

793
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Him

794
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,112
So that was really the beginning of that

795
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,696
Channel freaky thing they love finding like all the new

796
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
7UP

797
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,608
And great stuff out in the in America but you know that was just seen is Lucas so it was

798
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
Next year he should have took out and

799
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
Filled it up which is still happening

800
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,240
Ahsoka see you expand

801
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
Right you start to expand and

802
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,176
How many stores did you have after that first one and then how long does it take you

803
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,736
To get outside of Columbus and

804
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Outside of Ohio

805
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:55,136
Guess who in 2006 we opened our first around the market in Grandview and then we quickly opened

806
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
The Short North

807
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
And then it was doubled in Bexley

808
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Herein

809
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Columbus

810
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
And then I did a book

811
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
And that was really great and I got some national a lot of national

812
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Toradol that

813
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
And then we opened in Nashville

814
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:14,080
Two things seem to be going really well you guys are growing

815
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Sustainable

816
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
And then 2015

817
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
Kits and you have

818
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
The biggest crisis

819
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Ever

820
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
What happened

821
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,160
In 2015 we had

822
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll set the stage just a little bit we had just opened la

823
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
And

824
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,888
I had just done a collection of ice creams inspired by colors

825
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
From Matisse

826
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
MN

827
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
Everybody wanted to write about those and it was like this

828
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Incredible time

829
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
And we're just riding High

830
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
And then we get it and then one day we get this

831
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
Yes we're bomb dropped on us which was

832
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
That

833
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,368
A pint of ice cream in Lincoln Nebraska

834
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Tested positive for Listeria

835
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
It was the call that none of us

836
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Could imagine never wanted to get

837
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
John walked by my office

838
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
And I was like

839
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
Listen to Somebody talk about cardboard

840
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,824
It was actually company that we really liked but that was what we were doing we're talkin about cardboard

841
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
And I like

842
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
Saw his the expression on his face

843
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
And it was just like

844
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
I've never seen before and I know John really well so

845
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
I got up and left and

846
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Learn learn that news

847
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
So

848
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
You stopped production

849
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
We did so we huddled up

850
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
All the team

851
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,192
We had to make a lot of decisions very quickly over a very short. Of time

852
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,776
We had to decide what we were going to do

853
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
And recall all that ice

854
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
So we decided that we're going to recall everything

855
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
We

856
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Nobody was sick

857
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Which is great

858
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
I mean that we knew of it

859
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Yeah and we weren't sure

860
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
But we needed to prevent an hour

861
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,207
So we did we we file the paperwork we figured out how to do it

862
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
We we got approval from the FDA and we did a full recall Within

863
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
Yo hours

864
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
Which men

865
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
That 265 tons of ice cream

866
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Betty been out in the world

867
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
Came back to us

868
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
And there we were

869
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
We don't have no ice cream

870
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
And stores that are closed and

871
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,759
No way to make ice cream because we still got to figure out where that was. Came from

872
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,343
So the clock starts ticking then at that point in

873
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
My 600 please

874
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
When I have nothing to do

875
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Creamy

876
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Actually

877
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Did you

878
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
Did you think there's a possibility that you would

879
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
Shut down that your business

880
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Good basic

881
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,287
I think at that point when we started to sort of look around we realized that that was

882
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
It.

883
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
There wasn't anything left

884
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
And it was weird because

885
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
I just have a journal the time and it's like

886
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
I don't even have any ideas

887
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
But I knew and I trusted

888
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,951
The John and our incredible team we're working very hard on

889
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
Getting to the bottom of it

890
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,071
I mean you look at it, like Chipotle which had

891
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
Taiwan food safety crisis

892
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
Arguably they still haven't recovered from that

893
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,263
Finally did you guys recover from that you're much bigger company three years later

894
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
What would you think explains it

895
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,383
I mean you you weather that storm

896
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,711
And you're much bigger today than you were then

897
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
Well we

898
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,575
We've learned so much I think we've been pretty

899
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Open 2 about

900
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
Dad and I think that people

901
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
Relate to that

902
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,791
Kind of personality or that sort of openness I'm in the end

903
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,375
The listeria was coming out of a hairline crack over by the

904
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,727
Wall behind a piece of equipment and it's like we finally found it which we celebrated

905
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
The funny thing was

906
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Not funny but

907
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
When we close our stores we had

908
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
These wonderful

909
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,943
People who would put Post-it notes of

910
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
At the stores and like

911
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
They were so beautiful

912
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,159
And we were just like you know what we're fighting for that like we're fighting for this community

913
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,535
And I think because we raised our company as a community with our community

914
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
There was a lot of trust built into that

915
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
That's what

916
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Saved us

917
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,055
Mince pies anything about this little stall at the North Market

918
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,383
Today it's a company got 32 stores right

919
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,223
Doing more than 30 million dollars in annual sales

920
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503

922
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343

Great

933
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
I don't know why but

934
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,271
I don't know I mean I I like making ice cream and I want to make ice

935
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
What I do and how I

936
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
It's actually how I

937
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
I think

938
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:19,743
If I'm 44 years old I started my Harrison when I was 21 22 some more than half my entire life most

939
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
What I remember

940
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
Has been devoted to this so

941
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
For me it's

942
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,423
Hard to imagine doing something outside I really truly the puzzle that I still

943
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
And working on and so

944
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
And I will see

945
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
How how much of

946
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,823
The success of your company do you think is because of

947
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
All the hard work you put it and how much of it is

948
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Because of of luck

949
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
I think about I think about

950
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Luck sometimes

951
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,759
Yeah I think sometimes luck is like

952
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
You're getting a good wave

953
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,391
You know and you got to ride it as far as you possibly can we all have luck and I had

954
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159

But bad luck to I mean I had really really good like in really really bad like in my life

959
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,191
And I feel like both have made me

960
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
Who I am and then there's this like middle place be

961
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
Between those two that you get to make decisions

962
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
And

963
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
