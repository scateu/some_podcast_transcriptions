As a singing Trio this was sick

44
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
60 years ago

45
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
And now well we can't imagine our childhoods without them

46
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
In the massive brand they built

47
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456

And that's

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Because

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,696
I'm like most other creative people in Hollywood

103
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
Ross and Janice and the Chipmunks they own the intellectual property

104
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839

Mentor was Rodger dad

112
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,855
58 Reisinger was a struggling songwriter who was looking for a break

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Figured out a way to change the pitch

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Elvis singing voice

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
The result

116
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
The Witch Doctor song

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,263
The song became a hit and run

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
Soon came up with this concept that it was song by these

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Anthropomorphic rodents

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Call the Chipmunks

121
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Seniors career took off

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
The Chipmunks

123
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Became a radio show and then

124
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Cartoon on television

125
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
In Frost Jr

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
He watched his dad

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Become famous

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
100% it changed

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Literally overnight first with which

130
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Witch Doctor witch

131
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
It was like March 1958

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
And then of course

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
The Chipmunks were

134
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
That November December

135
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
So we got a swimming pool

136
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,895
Also I was I was much more impressed that we had a swimming pool than that my dad

137
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Was on The Ed Sullivan

138
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Show doing the witch doctor or Dick Clark's

139
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
American band

140
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Standard what app

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
I remember he would always bring my brother and sister and I

142
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Into his Dannon play

143
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,535
Weather was Witch Doctor the Chipmunks song or whatever and we loved

144
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
When Alvin started talking back

145
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
To our dad

146
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
We just

147
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Fell in love

148
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
With nausea

149
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
The song but the audacity

150
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Of that little character

151
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Because we didn't really talk back

152
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,431
To my dad that much so we thought Alvin really

153
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
We had a lot of spunk

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
That we admire

155
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
What was your dad like was he

156
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Elysium

157
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Who sang What the witch doctor

158
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,255
We see this impresario was he charismatic was he silly or you know what he was all of them

159
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
That guy he was

160
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
Bigger than life he was served the Armenian version of

161
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
The Zorba the Greek

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,751
So are all 5-7 up him but you always thought and everyone a mess

163
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Thought that he was 6-5

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
He just carried himself that way but he was

165
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Funny

166
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
He was incredibly creative

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
He loved Muse

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
Music in really thought of himself as a musician

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
He loved songwriting

170
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
And started writing songs

171
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
When he was 16 years old

172
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Driving a truck in The Vineyards of

173
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Fresno

174
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Dinosaur song was

175
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Call nuts to you

176
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
So,

177
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
From nuts

178
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Kim little

179
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Yeah

180
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
So when you were a kid Ross

181
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Did you think that

182
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
You would be involved in in the family business

183
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
100% no

184
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
You know

185
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
A growing up

186
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
I didn't even want to go to the recording session

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
My dad would say

188
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,087
Who do you want to come and let's see how we do this and what I go yeah no

189
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
Popeye I got a big little league game here so

190
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
I'm going to not make it to that

191
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
But growing up

192
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
As I started

193
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
To realize

194
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
What kind of a career was I heading for

195
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
Are the only thing I was certain of while my dad

196
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Still alive was that

197
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
I wasn't going to

198
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,663
Be involved with the Chipmunks or what my dad had done not because I didn't love what he had created but because

199
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
They were such big shoes

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
To fill

201
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
That I didn't want to try and step into

202
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
I know process

203
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
Hero 2423

204
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
When your dad died

205
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
What would he want

206
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Your life

207
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,983
After my dad passed away and before he had passed away he said

208
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
I really want to encourage you

209
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Go to Los

210
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
When I

211
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
I just hated that idea but when he passed away

212
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
All of a sudden

213
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
You saw the kind of

214
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,319
Folks coming out of the woodwork that would try and take

215
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Whether it was music

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Publishing from the

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
The family or

218
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Wineries and Vineyards that

219
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,535
He had built up over the years and I realized

220
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Did my dad wanted me to go to law school and obviously not to become a lawyer but basically to have a

221
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Kind of a

222
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Mental martial arts

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Protection

224
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Because he always

225
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
It said look there's creating

226
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,175
What you do and then there's continuing to own

227
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
You doing and those are tough things

228
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
To do at both X and less you know

229
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
How to protect yourself

230
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Open and contracts

231
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Rocks and soil for sale

232
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
After he passed away I immediately enrolled Pascual

233
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
So I graduated

234
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,631
3 years later and 75 pass the bar wasn't going to

235
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
How to spell all but

236
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Wanted to know that

237
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
With a music publishing and end the things that I was hoped

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
To create

239
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Later on

240
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
I wanted to know how to

241
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Hold on to them as my dad

242
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Did you I mean at that point where you

243
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Already thinking about

244
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Going to waste it to revive

245
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
At the Chipmunks

246
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Yes

247
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
After my dad passed away

248
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
I would go up into his office and just listen to

249
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
The song

250
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
City of duenweg water

251
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
The old TV shows

252
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Sofia done at the Alvin show

253
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
And I just thought

254
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
I didn't want the Chipmunks

255
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
2

256
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
Pass away as suddenly is my dad

257
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
And I wanted to figure out

258
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Someway.

259
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Try and bring them back

260
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
So when I met Janice

261
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
And she had loved

262
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
The characters growing up

263
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
And I was

264
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
One of the shows

265
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Folks letters

266
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Mercy

267
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
So I now had

268
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Another believer with me

269
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
And I said

270
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
I just want to see

271
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
If we can do this for you

272
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Just a year or two

273
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Bring in a kind of a trip

274
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
You to my dad and then

275
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
And imma go and do you know of course all the other things that we're interested

276
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Cash go back for seconds I want to ask

277
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Janice

278
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
About where you were

279
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Because you were

280
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
You were like you are actor

281
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Yeah

282
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Yu Yuan Ross

283
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
Well we met at a Health Food Vegetarian restaurant

284
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,599
And I didn't inhale a

285
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Saw

286
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
A friend of mine

287
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Who is

288
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
Having dinner with raw so I didn't know

289
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
I went up to her to say hello and

290
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Was introduced

291
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Mr. Ross

292
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
And

293
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
The following day I got a

294
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Bouquet of flowers

295
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Where's where I was work

296
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Working and

297
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
The next day I got another

298
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Okay and they were all signed

299
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
By Ross

300
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
But I

301
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
I hadn't remembered his name so I didn't know who is sending me these flowers

302
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,039
I made quite the impression that you can tell.

303
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Several weeks

304
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
And

305
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Finally he called

306
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
He said hi

307
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Agenesis

308
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Thank you for those flowers there

309
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Beautiful

310
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:19,679
Who are you and then he asked me on a date

311
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,287
And it it took about three years for me to come around 3 years

312
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Right

313
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Took me to his

314
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Father's Office

315
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
At at night and it was

316
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
And I will going up the elevator and I'm thinking

317
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Where we going

318
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,647
I didn't tell anybody I was going out with this guy and and what are we doing in this bill hang him

319
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
Put on the weak spark into an office and they put on the old Chipmunks

320
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
And I thought wow

321
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,911
Interesting and then he told me he was the son of prospect

322
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Cesarean

323
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,031
And I said oh my God that was one of the

324
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,871
Douche few cartoon shows I watch them and love them

325
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
So then he said you think they would be viable today and I said

326
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
I would think so

327
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
And I had it listed her

328
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
On my impossible Quest

329
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Stud My Little Don Quixote

330
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Fighting fighting these little windmills

331
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
To get the Chipmunks exactly

332
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
You just like

333
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Start trying to

334
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Pitch people on this

335
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Yep we'll first

336
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
We went to CVS because they had run the old shows the Alvin show so that seem like an act

337
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
To go in and

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
Listen we thought we loved what your dad did

339
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
We thought it was great but we

340
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
We think history is moved on and and it had its wonderful

341
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Time in that

342
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
That's really over

343
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
So then we went to the music

344
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,255
The side of things and I don't know if they just spoken to the people at CVS

345
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,143
They said you know that was a wonderful wonderful characters and your dad had a great

346
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Success but we think that's

347
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,055
Time has passed in and you guys should move on to something after young and capable and off

348
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335

382
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Time somebody who's trying

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
The next big thing

384
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,567
Would certainly look at your proposal say all that the throwback to the 50s were doing like

385
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Roomba crazy things now

386
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Nina Ross taught me the power of tenacity

387
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Guy he pursued me for

388
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
For three years

389
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Every single day

390
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,183
Because because because I knew we were right I knew what this was.

391
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Perfect person for me

392
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
And not to equate Janis with the Chipmunks but

393
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
But I honestly believe when you really believe in something so clearly

394
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Say it's so

395
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Clear for you is that as

396
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
That was for me but I didn't

397
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Care what anybody else

398
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Said

399
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
We were going to make this happen if it took a year

400
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Orphan

401
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Three-decker

402
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Why did you believe that it would work any why all of these experts

403
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Noah

404
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
And all of these people who

405
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Experts on television

406
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Look this is a

407
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
This is oldest

408
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Tire franchise like Vino just enjoy life and

409
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,447
Any why did you think they were wrong to to two things number one

410
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,031
What we came to realize is that there actually are no a

411
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
You know nobody

412
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Really knows

413
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
And so I was just willing to

414
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
To put my belief

415
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Above

416
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
What other people were

417
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
For telling us in and Janice felt

418
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
The same way we thought they were

419
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Yeah I felt I felt that

420
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Let you know in listening

421
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
2

422
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
The Chipmunks song and the witch doctor

423
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
Doctor in Alvin

424
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Presidents

425
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
That there was this relationship

426
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
With Dave and this

427
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
Chipmunk who kept pushing his buttons and I believed that relationship

428
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
So did millions of

429
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
Other people in and he really enjoyed

430
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
That that Dave and Alvin really endeared themselves

431
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
To us and I thought

432
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
If we could get that relationship in the shows

433
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Then it could happen again

434
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,391
So what happened what was the turning point

435
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
The turning point was a disc

436
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Stockings

437
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Philadelphia

00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767

00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167

The Chipmunks

448
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
And his a switchboard lit up

449
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
And

450
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
All these people called wanting to know where they

451
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
I could get the album and a record company back east

452
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
Found out about this and called us up

453
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
And said that would you be interested in doing

454
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
A chipmunk we didn't even listen to the end of the sentence

455
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,567
It was just some random small was in a small room

456
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Could you do a chipmunk

457
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,431
Punk album would you be interested in a chipmunk Punk album

458
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
We were

459
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
We're very up

460
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
For it and as a

461
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
It turns out it

462
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
It's sold over a million

463
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Albums

464
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Overnight and

465
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,767
Then the people at CVS

466
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
You know of a sudden they wanted

467
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Have lunch

468
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
And was it relatively cheap

469
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Mapreduce

470
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
I don't like to say cheap

471
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
I would say any

472
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
Wow so you put that record out it just

473
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
Sells like crazy on then what and then

474
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Television

475
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:04,415
Follows telling company start to call you will right after that as Janice mentioned not only were the TV

476
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,255
Folks who we'd gone to much more receptive and now interested

477
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
But it also gave us a

478
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
The chance to look at doing

479
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
More music

480
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Because obviously added sold so well

481
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
So we were approached

482
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,031
To do not only a Christmas album but also

483
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
And we thought okay what would be

484
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
You know the

485
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
The farthest

486
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Staying away from

487
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
This album cuz we didn't want to

488
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Do a repeat of that

489
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
So

490
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Urban cowboy hat come out and we thought you know what

491
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Let's go to Nash

492
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Phil and

493
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Record

494
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Urban

495
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Chipmunk

496
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
So we

497
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
We took songs from Kenny Rogers and

498
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,423
The whole bunch of Love a Rainy Night Thank God I'm a Country Boy all of these different songs

499
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
But one of the things

500
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
The chance wanted to do in that album

501
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Was now create

502
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Some dialogue some stories

503
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Do some personality and nausea

504
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Nacho song song songs

505
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Yeah and said that I said

506
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Draw so how do we do this

507
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
How did your dad do the voices

508
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
End

509
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
The dialogue and he said

510
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,791
I have no idea what did I know

511
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
Went back to the house and I played his

512
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Fathers

513
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Tapes

514
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Saw that he

515
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Talk to task

516
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Until I went back can I said okay

517
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
This is what we do

518
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
So you're you guys are recording this like

519
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
You're speaking Barrack

520
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Clearly and

521
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
Slowly so then what are you

522
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
Speed up the tape it sounds

523
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
It's the same speed as we

524
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Speak but it's at a higher pitch

525
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Right

526
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Just a dresser like a legit

527
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Disco question

528
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
When you started

529
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
To do the voices

530
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:52,191
How did you just give me a sense give me a little taste of obviously everyone listening knows you are Dave

531
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
Like how do you record Alvin Lee

532
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
Just give me a line of

533
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,199
How you would record I will do that but I want to also say that

534
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Janice was

535
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
Just wonderful is Theodore right from the beginning and I was

536
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Still

537
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,415
So tied to what my dad had done which was

538
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Barry

539
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Clear and

540
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
When my dad did Alvin it was

541
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Hello Dave

542
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
How are you doing today

543
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,167
Very stilted and it didn't feel real

544
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
So

545
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Janice

546
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
I would say

547
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Ross University

548
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,591
Don't try and do an impersonation of your daddy there's David's

549
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Seville

550
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Salvatore Simon

551
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,223
You don't loosen him up make it a little bit more your own

552
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
And so

553
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Now after

554
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
All of these years

555
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,415
I've obviously gotten better and so now Alvin is

556
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,487
More fluid for me and even though I have to

557
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
To talk more

558
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Slowly

559
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583

568
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
There's nothing more to say Alvin

573
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
No

574
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,192
So television.

575
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Actually didn't end up

576
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,824
Happening cuz it happened I guess in in 1983 that the Chipmunks cartoon

577
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
Comes back on TV right before that guy in 1981 Jensen I've been taking around a Chris

578
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
Christmas idea Christmas special

579
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
From probably around 78 or so

580
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
So so after

581
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
Chipmunk Punk comes out and does so well and then Urban chipmunk

582
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,328
NBC said to us am I know we told you we thought that was a

583
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Terrible idea and we didn't like that

584
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Chipmunks butt

585
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
We now

586
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
Think with those two of platinum albums

587
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
Maybe that Christmas special is a good idea

588
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Did you get any Executives that have

589
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Previously rejected YouTube

590
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
End up meeting with them and and and having

591
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Glade begging you to come back

592
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Yes

593
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,112
And I'm not going to give you names but many of those people that were on our list

594
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,488
A lot of my old but so when they approach you they said we want to do a Christmas

595
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
Special did you have a concept

596
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,864
What the cartoon would look like a howdy animated and

597
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:34,752
Did you already have that laid out or did you figure that out we didn't even we had never written anything be

598
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
T4m

599
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
And then when they say sit so who do you see riding it raw said

600
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
We're going to write it

601
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
And I looked at him

602
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Across the room

603
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Declared him like what

604
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Saying

605
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
And

606
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
And again because of out of necessity

607
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
We wrote it

608
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,792
And then no we didn't have a look we didn't have

609
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
The voices we

610
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Still warned expert

611
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Add

612
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
How did you even know what

613
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Do I mean obviously

614
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
You know you're both super

615
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Smart and talented

616
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Animations

617
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,944
Studio overnight you're standing up in Animation Studio

618
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Which by the way United

619
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Very expensive

620
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Is it still hand

621
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Stop right

622
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,136
Exactly Ross and I have done everything everything we've

623
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
If I ventured into we've know nothing about

624
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
So it's the

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,072
Instart from stupid

626
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
The hardest way in the best way to learn

627
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,728
And you just go step-by-step okay we need to create Carrick

628
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
Okay we need to know what this world looks like and

629
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
We were really

630
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Very fortunate

631
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Because

632
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Some of the

633
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
Great animators from Warner Brother

634
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Including Chuck

635
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Jonesing

636
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Phil Monroe

637
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
Virtual Ross and these guys who have done

638
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
The greatest bugs

639
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Funny cartoons in

640
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
The 40s

641
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
50s

642
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Were available

643
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
And they weren't being used in

644
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Janice and I hired

645
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
All of them to make

646
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
Author the Christmas Special A Chipmunk Christmas

647
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
After that Christmas special event

648
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
ABC

649
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Clearly

650
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Is a success because in NBA

651
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Car deal with you

652
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
What was that first it was

653
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
What's today at 1

654
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
One season of

655
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
About in the Chipmunks

656
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,336
Yeah it was always that that sort of Wonderful

657
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Full first

658
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
The first series

659
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Steel so it was

660
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
It could be as long as five years but we

661
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Was one year at

662
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
At a time

663
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
And

664
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,648
We got very little money for it back in those days

665
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
Like $210,000

666
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
1/2 hour

667
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Shows

668
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
So there wasn't much

669
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
To cover all your

670
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
Absolutely so and we were you

671
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,544
Oh yeah we were we were used to going into our own pocket yeah

672
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,688
What is the show launches in in 19

673
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
This was on

674
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
Saturday morning

675
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
That's right

676
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
And we were against bugs

677
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Bunny

678
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
On ABC and CBS

679
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
Who didn't want us we have gone to them first

680
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,768
Cuz they said why do we need the Chipmunks we've got Charlie Brown

681
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Snoopy

682
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Yeah

683
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680
We could be the hero you could have two weeks with a Snoopy at

684
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Anyway so we turned out to be a against

685
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Orbs

686
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
Charlie Brown and Snoopy in

687
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
And the Chipmunks

688
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Series was a

689
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,992
Giant hit right from the beginning I remember

690
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
So I mean it's interesting because

691
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
What you think about

692
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
Consumer right you're thinking about

693
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Mickey Mouse now then

694
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Bugs Bunny

695
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
The Peanuts Gang and they're all great like we love them all we have

696
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
These warm feelings about them but actually

697
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
From the perspective of the creators of these

698
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Characters like

699
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
These are competitors

700
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
You go ahead I guess I never see them is

701
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Competitors

702
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,992
You didn't like what I just Crush Mickey

703
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,600
No I wanted to get my arms around

704
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,720
We Are Young we honestly always felt it was like our

705
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
Conversation with CBS when they said well we've already got

706
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,096
You know Snoopy & Charlie Brown

707
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Always thought that

708
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Good

709
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704

710

711
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824

And Ross and Janice get

762
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Through the first

763
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Season

764
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
4

765
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
NBC

766
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Even though

767
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
The show is

768
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Reaching huge audiences

769
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,832
Start making a whole lot of money

770
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Remember the

771
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
The deal they signed with NBC was for

772
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
$200,000 for the whole set

773
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
But what they do

774
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,096
Did have with something much more valuable

775
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
The rights

776
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
To the Chipmunks

777
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
I mean you guys own

778
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Everything out

779
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
You own that you own the best

780
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Recordings yuan

781
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Animations

782
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Characters

783
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
How is it possible that NBC

784
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
He didn't say

785
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Hey if you want to deal with us

786
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
You know we own the rights

787
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
What did you know because my dad had

788
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
And not only is you mentioned

789
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Set that up he was

790
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
The first

791
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Songwriter

792
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Who not only owned

793
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
The publishing a but also

794
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,448
The master recordings in and that's what interesting lie when we met

795
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Berry Gordy years later

796
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
He said you know I learned a very valuable

797
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Simple things

798
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
When I was writing songs

799
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
I decided to

800
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
Found mold

801
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Town

802
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,784
Because I wanted to own the master recordings the way your dad

803
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,368
So it was my dad was really

804
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Not only really

805
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
This great mix of

806
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
Creativity but also very

807
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,536
Really smart about business

808
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Listen and so

809
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
I knew that

810
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Is my dad mention

811
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
There was creating

812
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Wonderful

813
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Product but then there was

814
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Holding on to

815
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
Bremen NBC said we will make this into a

816
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Cartoon for you

817
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
And you guys have been

818
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Pitching this

819
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Racing

820
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,064
I mean if NBC would have said to you but these are our terms

821
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
I mean

822
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,208
Will we we we walked away we would have because what we said is look

823
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Will produce it

824
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,584
We'll make sure we get the financing together we'll get a license

825
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
Speed from you we brought in Kellogg so Kellogg's

826
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
Was our spawn

827
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
Answer and

828
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Janice and I

829
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,544
Wrote the shows and then we produced it

830
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
And

831
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
Dr.

832
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
First season they came to Janice and they said okay we'd like

833
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
To expand now we want you guys to do an hour

834
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Nada

835
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Half an hour

836
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
And and we we just said

837
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
We can't even make a half-hour we're proud of

838
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,512
So we when we can't work any longer unless you make more than seven days in the week

839
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
So we're going to turn it down

840
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
And she said no and Janice

841
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Nobody turns down

842
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
More shows

843
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
But we did

844
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
So you are you making these shows for NBC you're obviously

845
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Not making any

846
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Real money from

847
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Finishes cuz it's going to pay the production

848
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Cost but you are getting all the

849
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Disability so

850
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
But you're also running a business the Chipmunk

851
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Did you guys sit down and say

852
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
This is a busy

853
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
Let's think about how to make the

854
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,512
Did something really really big what was the

855
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
What it what was it that you start to think about

856
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
You know

857
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,400
Guy we were just sitting at home all the time

858
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:12,800
So we didn't you see the numbers you see the ratings but they don't really translate into people

859
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
You know you can imagine but

860
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
You just don't get it

861
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Back in those days

862
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
Sky we were getting like 40% of

863
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Of the audience

864
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,832
Like 20 million a week or 15 to 20 million a week so

865
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
Finally we got an invitation we did a live

866
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
Show and it was at Madison

867
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
Square Garden address

868
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
Yeah we did the voices and

869
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,888
Design the costumes and got a story together

870
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
And we didn't have time to

871
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Torrid but we

872
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
Go to Madison Square Garden

873
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
And when we went to the box office

874
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
The guy said no I didn't know you were coming I sold your

875
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Tickets

876
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
It was sold out

877
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
Constitutes

878
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
To see the shack

879
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
And he's and I said

880
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Are we are the

881
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
Anyway he let us sit in the aisle

882
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
And

883
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,560
For the first time we saw a fans we saw kids

884
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
Waving chipmunk banners

885
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
Screaming in the place was filled and it was such

886
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Ammoman

887
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,776
For us it will never forget it was like oh my God

888
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
There are

889
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
There are people

890
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,712
A&B like the show they like the characters

891
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
So that mean your business really be

892
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Can the chip

893
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
It was

894
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
The television show on NBC was record

895
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,816
Merchandising live shows in

896
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
And I guess like syndication

897
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Yeah

898
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,984
And this is one of the funny business stories and I I found it in

899
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Interesting only

900
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
The only because later on it turned out

901
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
To be such a windfall that we did not know about

902
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
But they said look up

903
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
What's going to happen is it

904
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,760
CBS Viacom is going to run your dad's old shows

905
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
The Alvin show

906
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
Against us

907
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,160
Because now that you're bringing the Chipmunks back so successfully with the albums in the

908
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
Especially now the new series

909
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
You have to get

910
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Viacom

911
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
To not do it on Saturday morning and we want you

912
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
Offer them the syndication rights

913
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
For the new series

914
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Esl just

915
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Not run up against

916
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,592
Dusk and so Janice and I not knowing the value of sin.

917
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,920
When did Viacom CBS instead okay

918
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,760
If you just won't run against our new shows on NBC

919
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,344
Will give you the syndication rights to our new series

920
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
And they

921
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,720
A very full of themselves said no we're not going to

922
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
That deal

923
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
And then

924
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
A couple years later we

925
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Sold those

926
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
425 million dollars

927
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,192
For something wow and that's and that was where the money

928
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,592
Was which we did not know we were and was

929
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Actually yours NBC

930
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,248
No NADA de NBC didn't get a pee smell

931
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
But in 1985 you more money I mean

932
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
What is that mean to that

933
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
I think anybody listening would just

934
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Assume that that was that you guys were

935
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Set for

936
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,704
Well first of all was very exciting and end it was just a number

937
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
I wish I was always a kid

938
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
You don't always watching the

939
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
The you know the prices

940
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Is right as a six-year-old

941
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
I knew what

942
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
The dishwasher would go for or the

943
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
And my mom would always say

944
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
How do you know that you've not bought dishwashers

945
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,576
Had a sense of what

946
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
A price for something was going to be

947
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
So I had just set that price

948
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
And I didn't change until we got it

949
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
And

950
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Janice and I

951
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
So wanted

952
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,192
To make something we were really proud of not just something that was sick

953
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Successful

954
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Cuz the TV show

955
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Was obviously tremendously

956
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Successful

957
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
But we were never able to give it the kind of

958
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
The quality that we had hoped

959
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
To do so

960
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
Yes you would think we would be set

961
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
But

962
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
Because we always wanted to do something we'd also be

963
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Be proud of

964
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
We

965
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:16,000
Took most of that money and made an animated feature the Chipmunk Adventure

966
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Churon Inn

967
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Quebec which came out Navy

968
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
And that that movie did pretty well right you did it it did well but we didn't at least in that initial that we didn't

969
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Get our money back back in those

970
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Because unfortunately we

971
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,848
Signed on with a distributor

972
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
That was going to put

973
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,712
X number of dollars into marketing Addis

974
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Distribute we were

975
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
They spent less than 900000

976
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
Marketing the the movie at

977
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
And including the prince and advert

978
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
I think so

979
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
It it it

980
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,560
It did okay but it did not remotely get us our money back until

981
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
Many DVD sales

982
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,168
Ross Road a little article on that

983
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
Experience

984
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Making the movie called

985
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
The agony

986
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
And the agony

987
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,944
Hard to find a bride

988
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
Different stories about because the show airs

989
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
On NBC

990
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
And you are doing original

991
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
A new episodes until 1990 and then

992
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
I guess it's in syndication

993
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
And then you guys decide to move on you you

994
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
You basically

995
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Leave NBC and

996
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Cut a deal with

997
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
Universal to bring the show back so

998
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
What

999
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
What was that about

1000
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
So one of the things that they wanted

1001
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
The do was

1002
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
Create their own Mickey Mouse

1003
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
I'll send end

1004
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
They had had Woody Woodpecker

1005
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
4 years

1006
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
But Woody didn't have

1007
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
A disorder of resonance

1008
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,112
For Generations the way Alvin did and certainly didn't

1009
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
The way Mickey Mouse

1010
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Didn't they it

1011
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Had seen that

1012
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,976
When we had gone head-to-head weather was

1013
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
With Mickey Mouse

1014
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Album art

1015
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
TV show

1016
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Or what have you that

1017
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
The Chipmunks

1018
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
Not only held their own but

1019
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
But did very very well in

1020
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,056
Came out on top so Universal loved that

1021
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,384
Jesus Alvin could be our Mickey Mouse

1022
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,432
So the idea then was

1023
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
They were going to

1024
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Create a

1025
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
An animation

1026
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Unit for us

1027
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Jenison Auto

1028
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,136
We're going to run that we would of course I'd only do more more chipmunk stuff but

1029
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
A lot of other things that we had showed them that

1030
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:28,096
Wow yeah that we were going to be in their theme parks and end that part actually did happen but

1031
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
It was going to be this

1032
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
Whole schmorgus

1033
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Spore goodbye

1034
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
Opportunity and sulfur Janice

1035
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Send for me

1036
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
Oh my gosh this sounds fantastic

1037
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
Did you have to give up some of your ownership

1038
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
Perfect date they bought a 25

1039
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
5% share at that point

1040
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Time in end

1041
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
In the end that

1042
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
For the opportunity

1043
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
For what felt like a

1044
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Really exciting opportunity to

1045
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,744
Grow the business in a much larger way

1046
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Felt like a great thing

1047
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,608
Did that the money was going to help you scale

1048
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
They were going to be

1049
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
Also putting money into

1050
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
Development and production of all of the

1051
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,616
Thanks and then shortly after we sign that

1052
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Deal

1053
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
All the folks who wanted to do that

1054
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
We're gone

1055
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
What do you mean they're gone

1056
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,904
They all laughed and so now you are that we wind up in a place that

1057
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
Wasn't the same

1058
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
As we thought

1059
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
It was when I

1060
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
What you mean like all the other people trying to do with you

1061
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
University of Oregon do you still have this

1062
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,680
Deal with universal I mean they would still have the commitments

1063
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
I mean I guess personally to make movies into

1064
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Do all kinds of stuff so

1065
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Why wouldn't you just do it

1066
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Yeah well we

1067
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
Certainly wanted to do it but you idiot ass

1068
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Do you have to

1069
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Why they didn't win

1070
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,832
Stop doing much of anybody new comes in and they have a different vision

1071
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,160
Yeah so those were not our happy years and we wound up

1072
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
What are standards

1073
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
What happens if you stop answering your calls because

1074
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,120
You were presumably working on ideas

1075
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,192
Will you pitching it in they were saying no

1076
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Or what was it

1077
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
Just ignoring you what was

1078
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
It was a, then yeah I know it was a combination

1079
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
It started out various

1080
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Excited

1081
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
And then

1082
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
Some of the folks who brought us in

1083
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
You know

1084
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Would leave

1085
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,904
It'd be harder to get through to them then it would become

1086
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
No return calls and end

1087
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,816
Yeah it was just you felt very much like the orphan child that

1088
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
That was brought in to be

1089
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,960
You know the favorite son and then all of a sudden you

1090
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
You aren't

1091
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,032
Soup to did Alvin and the Chipmunks basic

1092
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Oakley drop off the map

1093
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Points pretty much

1094
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
Yeah pretty much him and and so that's why we said to them

1095
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Listen

1096
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,040
We really want to do this that and the other we've got a lot of opportunity if not

1097
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,856
Here at Universal there's all kinds of Ventura

1098
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,416
Outside so we can do

1099
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Folks in

1100
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Japan want to put Chipmunk

1101
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Stores together

1102
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,424
Folks in Europe wants to make more spit so we'll just do all of those things and they said

1103
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
Oh no we can't we don't want to have too many cooks

1104
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
The kitchen

1105
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,592
And I said no cook in the kitchen

1106
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
So there's not a pot not a pan there's nobody

1107
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,272
There's no Cooks Here season you guys were just hanging around

1108
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
Pulling your hair out trying to get things off the ground and nothing

1109
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Yuck

1110
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Wasn't

1111
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,536
At all the kind of opportunity that we had hoped for in and finally in 2002

1112
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
2001 we were able to

1113
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
I'll go wash

1114
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
Separate way and you sue them to get back your company

1115
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
Yeah we we we had to you know you

1116
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
You unfortunately

1117
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,872
You have to protect your characters in and sometimes

1118
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
You tried exhausted every

1119
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Other

1120
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Because you don't want to go into this

1121
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Yes I'm telling everybody.

1122
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
Exhausted all other

1123
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
And you're up against the wall

1124
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
But once you're there

1125
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,583
You just have to be committed to that and we always win

1126
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
Really do stand very United

1127
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
What does it does it

1128
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Eat at you

1129
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Looks like it's

1130
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Got to be something that you

1131
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Can't get out of your head

1132
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Heaven Must affect your

1133
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
And just your thought process and it

1134
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Just must become all-consuming

1135
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Yeah and you don't understand why

1136
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,831
And what we've realized is that logic does not play a part in any of

1137
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
And that's the thing that's so

1138
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Strange to us

1139
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Because it's like

1140
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
Okay hold on a minute

1141
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,999
You have no interest in this

1142
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
We

1143
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,351
Are dedicating our entire lives

1144
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
To wit

1145
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,423
We should be able to find a way

1146
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
2

1147
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Separate this

1148
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Out

1149
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
And

1150
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
Go on our merry way

1151
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
And I tend to try to poop

1152
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Put something in a different

1153
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Perspective

1154
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Ice Age

1155
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
To Ross this is such a miserable

1156
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Experience

1157
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Then let's get something out of it

1158
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Let's make

1159
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
This is sort of fascinating

1160
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:12,255
I didn't find it fascinating the personality

1161
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,071
Have to I have to put it in a different category

1162
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
The Miserables

1163
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
And so I think okay well I'm going to learn what this process

1164
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
And how do I make this

1165
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,591
As good as I can make it very healthy approach to lawsuits I have to

1166
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,199
To say I'm I inspired I'm just wondering I mean

1167
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
From what from what I read the

1168
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
It was only

1169
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
Acceptably in mm

1170
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
For Sophie

1171
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Mm mm

1172
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
M4.

1173
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
Were you basically in like

1174
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Suspended limbo

1175
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
No no no no no because no because

1176
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,375
2001 was really the end of at the 2004 part was just

1177
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
That's when the last payment

1178
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
But we had to

1179
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
Make to them was Act

1180
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
Actually done

1181
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
To get our

1182
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
Company

1183
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,639
So now it now it now it was Guy now is about

1184
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
How do we

1185
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Resurrect

1186
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
The franchise tag

1187
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
Again after it basically

1188
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,415
How much did you have to pay them too

1189
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Buy-Back

1190
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
A two and a half million dollar

1191
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
Nothing right

1192
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,351
Did you guys a lot more exactly

1193
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,655
Okay so you guys get out of that deal

1194
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
And then you're free

1195
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Free and

1196
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
I guess it was a

1197
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
This point that you sign this multi movie

1198
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Deal with fox

1199
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
The Chipmunks

1200
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Heaven Catholic

1201
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Off the radar for

1202
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
Lots of year so

1203
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
To that effect

1204
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
Your ability to call a shot

1205
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Watching that negotiate

1206
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Well you know

1207
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
Not totally although you know

1208
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
You don't ever necessarily get the kind of deal.

1209
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
But you want that

1210
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
But we were very clear that you know WeeWorld

1211
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
As we have always been

1212
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
Be involved in every aspect and and then we say you know right from the start listen we are very proud

1213
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,543
Dietary if you don't want to work with

1214
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
With people like this

1215
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
Please you know I don't

1216
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Because

1217
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
Well get that

1218
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
Waco from the from the outside

1219
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
From the outside

1220
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
We are think we're like very reasonable and and protective of the characters no I mean if we were a pain in the ass I would say so

1221
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,887
I think but we're protective of the characters

1222
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,031
So is it 3 movies you made with fox now

1223
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,615
I think pink is enough the first one

1224
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Where the building is this

1225
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,735
Record executive action beard goatee David Cross

1226
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,039
David Cross and is that is that

1227
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
It is it is it like it's going to be eight and unsettle you know

1228
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,023
Experiences in this is in this industry will tell you

1229
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
One of these stories

1230
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
You know with our music

1231
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Sick situation

1232
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,911
What's that

1233
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
The end in 1982

1234
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
We are

1235
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
With a record company and I won't go into

1236
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Specifics

1237
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
Who or what we're going to protect

1238
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Guilty here

1239
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:19,647
So at we recording and the album comes out

1240
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
And we are told by the

1241
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Record executive

1242
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
Ross Janice I want you guys to

1243
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
To take take the Chipmunks on the road

1244
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
These are the

1245
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
7

1246
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,959
Cities we want you to go to travel across the country to the Seven Cities

1247
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,823
And make this album I hid in these 7 cities and if you do that

1248
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,895
We will give you a big National promotion

1249
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
Great okay

1250
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
We hit the road

1251
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:50,623
And I won't get into all of the crazy stuff that happens but in any event at the end of the

1252
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
Of the tour

1253
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,559
We in fact make the album a hit in each one of the Seven Cities we come back to the record executive

1254
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,703
So excited after a pretty bruising couple of weeks and

1255
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
Yeah. Like 12 years

1256
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,663
Any event we're all excited wanna now talk about the national plan to they're going to do and a

1257
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
This is a quote and it's so it explains why David crosses as Ian

1258
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,159
Is that character have to record Executives tells

1259
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Janice and me well

1260
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,559
We're not actually going to do the national

1261
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:36,191
Releasing the Big Marketing

1262
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,495
If you don't have it in writing

1263
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,519
You don't have

1264
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Wow

1265
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
So that

1266
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,383
Was a brutal lesson

1267
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
What we've learned a lot of lust

1268
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
For decades

1269
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Full of lessons

1270
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
You these movies the fox

1271
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Killed it they did

1272
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,975
Beanie Wells

1273
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,583
Almost a billion dollars what over it

1274
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,655
Their box office is about a billion

1275
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
300ml

1276
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,031
Wow and if you include the DVD sales

1277
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,591
It's over 2 billion.

1278
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Well I'm one of those.

1279
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
DVD buyers

1280
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
You can you can send me a

1281
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Thank you card right here on out here

1282
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,415
Exactly like you

1283
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Tiny

1284
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Cut of that 1.3

1285
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
3 billion

1286
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,303
So inevitably it's going to lead

1287
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
To some kind of

1288
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
It seems like

1289
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,655
The way these deals are set up it's like

1290
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,191
If all of a sudden he goes

1291
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,751
Beyond anybody's expectations

1292
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
They're delighted

1293
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,359
Could you guys get Squall the economics of it wouldn't have been

1294
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:53,759
The frustration for us cuz once when we make a deal we lie we live by the deal so that isn't the

1295
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
Frustration for us

1296
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
The frustration for us

1297
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Is

1298
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
Wanting to tell

1299
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
A certain kind of

1300
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Story with

1301
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Reflecting

1302
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
Certain kinds of scenes and and and dialogue and so forth for the characters that we

1303
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
Have spent four decades

1304
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Swear that's that

1305
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Honestly where the where the issue would be not the how the economics breakdown

1306
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:26,527
I know that you guys filed a lawsuit against Fox

1307
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,831
Because of some of this respiration I know you can't

1308
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
Talk about all the details of the

1309
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Was settled

1310
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
You know you have legal Act

1311
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,303
This company is essentially you work with and then you settle it

1312
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,375
You still have to work with them after I mean they're like

1313
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,191
There there must be some bad blood so how does that

1314
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
How do you interact with with Folks at Fox is it

1315
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,591
Like perfectly cordial and normal everybody puts on their

1316
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,991
Big boy's shorts and gets to work

1317
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
Have occasionally on the show interview.

1318
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Husband and wife

1319
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Teens you have

1320
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Kate and Andy Spade

1321
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Sherman Dodge

1322
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
And you guys and

1323
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
I'm always really impressed

1324
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
When

1325
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
When I talk

1326
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
Been married for 37 years

1327
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
And you obviously

1328
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Clearly like

1329
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Not only

1330
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
Love each other but you really were

1331
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Each other's judgment and

1332
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
And you carved out different roles

1333
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Yourself what

1334
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Is it just like serendipitous Aleworks or do you

1335
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
Do you actually

1336
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,975
No there's a there's actually a really simple approach that we have and in

1337
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,535
And is in this was right from the beginning

1338
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Because of our

1339
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Respect for one another

1340
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,239
If Janice had a different point of view and she felt more strongly about it than I do

1341
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
Then I would defer to

1342
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,311
To her if

1343
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Conversely

1344
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
I had a stronger

1345
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
Feeling about it than she did

1346
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
She would defer to me

1347
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,247
But right now because she's

1348
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,855
Writing the shows and directing them and designing them and so forth she really is

1349
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
The driving

1350
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,975
Force of the show and I'm thrilled

1351
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:16,607
You know to play a part with Alvin and Simon and and Dave and Jenny gets frustrated with me when I wake him up

1352
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
At 2 in the morning and say that

1353
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Grande

1354
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,215
I think you could do like 27 better

1355
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,519
No he's not.

1356
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,591
But we do respect

1357
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,991
Each other we work really well together and I thought about that too about husbands and wives and I I I think that it

1358
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
Either works

1359
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,087
And I could be wrong about this but I think it either works or it doesn't work

1360
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
If a couple is committed to

1361
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,023
You know going into therapy and really working on their Communications maybe two people that wouldn't normally be able

1362
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Go to work together

1363
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
To work it out but

1364
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,631
But we we just naturally work

1365
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
Very very well

1366
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Together

1367
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
You

1368
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
You guys

1369
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
Scaled this

1370
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Concept

1371
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
In a way that

1372
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
Anime

1373
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Your dad mean

1374
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
He did well he made lots of money

1375
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
Alvin and Chipmunks

1376
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Build a great life for

1377
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
What is family

1378
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
You guys took it to the

1379
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,855
Stratospheric level

1380
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
Completely different level

1381
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
The ashes of this

1382
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,535
Native

1383
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
Alvin the Chipmunks

1384
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,887
Well first of all he would be

1385
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Proud but but but also because my dad

1386
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,567
Had a very limited attention span on things

1387
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
I'm sure he would say

1388
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
What

1389
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,223
The hell are you guys doing 40 years later that it I also have

1390
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Tell you this serendipitous

1391
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
Story We Were

1392
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
In the eighties we would have to

1393
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
To drive down with

1394
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Finally moved

1395
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
To Santa Barbara and we would drive down to LA

1396
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,951
Pick up lines

1397
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Because the show is going to be on

1398
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
2 Days Later

1399
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,839
And we do our work

1400
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
And whatever else we had to

1401
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,935
Fill in for the story

1402
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
And we drove back at

1403
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,543
Right I probably 3 in the morning and I just

1404
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,847
You know automatically turn on the TV to just

1405
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,383
Unwind

1406
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
And I said oh my

1407
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
My dad

1408
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,063
Just can't imagine because the show wasn't coming out the way we wanted and Rossi

1409
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Said oh my God

1410
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
I can't imagine what my dad

1411
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
Does thinking and I said no no

1412
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
Know your dad would be very

1413
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
Proud at

1414
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
How hard were working hell

1415
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
How much were trying

1416
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,607
And on

1417
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
The television

1418
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Was his father

1419
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:32,799
On Discovery Show on Earth Greatest Show on Earth

1420
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
And my dad is in the audience

1421
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
Applauding

1422
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
And we looked

1423
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
Until I couldn't believe it

1424
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
And

1425
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
We start to cry

1426
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,647
But that was that was serendipitous

1427
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,207
I have to say

1428
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,607
Janice Karman and Ross bagdasarian are the duo Baha'i

1429
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,143
Find Alvin and the Chipmunks

1430
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:03,519
By the way the Chipmunks were actually named after Executives of the original record label

1431
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Alvin Bennett

1432
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,359
Simon and Theodore keep

1433
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,711
Were the chief Executives of Liberty records pekin 1958

1434
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
If you ever call you Dave

1435
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
You know what sometimes

1436
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,231
But sometimes they do

1437
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Or they'll say

1438
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,911
You know you sound so much like that David Seville character did anyone ever tell you that

1439
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,959
And then and then you got to do it

1440
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:39,871
Okay well and hopefully I'm not going to burn the mic up here doing this but

1441
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,759

1442
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719

1443
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767

Hey thanks for 6

1459
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Sticking around because

1460
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
Time now for

1461
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,671
Today we're updating story

1462
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,207
We first ran last year

1463
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
It begins with Alex vanderwarker

1464
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
Of Chico California

1465
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
Here's his question

1466
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:37,983
Yeah so it's have you ever Mix Concrete before I personally have not next concrete before

1467
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
But Alex has mixtape

1468
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
Especially when he was at

1469
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Teenager helping out

1470
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
With small jobs

1471
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:48,223
His dad's Construction Company typically what you do is you grab a bag of concrete

1472
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:53,599
You put it in the wheelbarrow you break it open you throw water in there and use the trouble to mix it around

1473
00:55:54,111 --> 00:56:00,255
And then you need a wheel that wheelbarrow wherever you need a new pour it when you do this over and over

1474
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
Can get to be a real

1475
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,375
It takes too long it's messy and then pouring it is just

1476
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Too challenging

1477
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
To do

1478
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,519
My dad and I would say okay we need a better way to mix the

1479
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
The stuff

1480
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
And so one day

1481
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
I want to fly reel

1482
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
Alex and his dad

1483
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,711
Ditch the wheelbarrow and they decided to use a lightweight

1484
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
Heart instead

1485
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
Poured the cement

1486
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
And the water onto the tarp

1487
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
And then held it up

1488
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Between them

1489
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:32,511
And instead of using a shovel or any other tool I would just use these four corners no kind of pick one side up at a time

1490
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Ineffectively

1491
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,655
Both the pile of concrete and water over itself and it would mix

1492
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
Very quickly

1493
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,983
And then you can just sort of pickup

1494
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,335
The tarp from one side and pour it into where you needed it

1495
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
Basic hacking Alex

1496
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,663
I really didn't think much of it

1497
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,479
But a few years later when he was taking business classes at

1498
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
College

1499
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:57,343
He said to his dad you know maybe we can make a sticker tarp to mix

1500
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
Cement and then sell it

1501
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:05,279
But for us it was like this really difficult leave and you know how do we create something that does

1502
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,303
What we wanted

1503
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
To do without knowing

1504
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
How to create a

1505
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,447
We didn't really we're not experts in the textile industry

1506
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,007
We know how to mix concrete and that's

1507
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
That's it

1508
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,079
So in order to Market a mixing that

1509
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,383
That people would actually want to buy

1510
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,919
Alex had to invent a

1511
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,735
A tarp that would form 10 of a bull when you

1512
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,039
You held it so the cement wouldn't spill out

1513
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,855
Another tarp had to be tough and waterproof

1514
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,903
Even after he and his dad found

1515
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,999
Just the right material is called a polyester denier blend and it's

1516
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,327
Is coated with PVC even after they found that

1517
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,631
They still have to find a way to make

1518
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
The actual map

1519
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,495
I was calling people in China and Mexico

1520
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
Trying to just be like okay who can make it

1521
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
I thought it would be easy

1522
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,383
And that took

1523
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
Years to do

1524
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,783
We finally got the mat manufactured a few years ago but when they pitched it to their

1525
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
Dream retailer

1526
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Home Depot

1527
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
Home Depot

1528
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
No

1529
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
And the funny thing is I spent

1530
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
Probably a year

1531
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:13,119
Learning the same lesson over and over which is you're not going to get in the Home Depot if you're a nobody

1532
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,703
So this is where a brand new business has to Pivot

1533
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,751
And that's exactly what Alex

1534
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,079
Did he figured maybe he could get churches and charities

1535
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
Used to buy them

1536
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,919
Bats and then donate them to places that

1537
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
Really needed them

1538
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,575
You know a huge amount of people that are impoverished in rural areas of the world that have

1539
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
Absolutely nothing and they live on dirt floors

1540
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,695
And Alex has several donors have already bought them at

1541
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,023
To help rebuild after natural disasters and places like Haiti

1542
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Mexico

1543
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:46,143
You know it started off as a slow tech product we just wanted to sell to make some money

1544
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,935
And it has

1545
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983

1546

1552
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
