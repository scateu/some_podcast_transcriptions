8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
Hey it's guy here

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
Pretty silly idea

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,528
Storing our stuff in the cloud right like

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Files

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
Photos of music

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
Lives up there

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Somewhere

15
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,696
But when Jennifer Hyman launched Rent the Runway

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,048
She essentially wanted our clothing to live in the Cloud 2

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
So she created a website

18
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
What does huge inventory of women's clothing that

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,704
You never had to own you would do

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
Rent it and send it back

21
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
Jen calls it a closet

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
In the cloud

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
Here's a story of how she and her

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
Your partner built Rent the Runway

25
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Is episode first Grand

26
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
August

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:59,904
I sent you know we should really call Diane Von Furstenberg the famous fashion designer

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Fast forward a few weeks and we're driving to the second meeting and her system calls and says Dad no longer wants to see

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
She's not interested in this idea and I said

30
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Oh yeah

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
We're just around the corner like what will the strap by for a second

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
And add her sister very firmly said she doesn't want to see you what do you not

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Understand and I said I saw for cutting off and I hung up and then I said down the

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,856
West Side Highway and we were

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
At her office and we just showed up

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,120
NPR how I built this

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
A show that innovators entrepreneurs

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Idealist

39
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Stories behind the movements

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
They felt

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,968
How to women who wanted High fashion but couldn't afford the price tag

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Decided to make it possible

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
The Rent the Runway

44
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
So Rent the Runway is

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Now we're the hottest fashion companies

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Is in the US

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Growing like crazy

48
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,680
Doing more than a hundred million dollars a year in Revenue

49
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
12

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Hundred employees

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
Core product is

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Designer dresses

53
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
Surprised to discover

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,248
But just 10 of its employees work in the fashion depart

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Most of the rest

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Well

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
They work for a technology company

58
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Because that's actually what Rent the Runway is

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,768
The way it works is you go online or you go to the app

60
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
And well you better dress

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Thousands of dollars to buy

62
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,056
Except you only pay a small fraction of that look fabulous for one night

63
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
And then in the morning covered

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
You mail it back

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
It's kind of like Zipcar means Netflix

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Zappos

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Came up with the idea when they met in Business School

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
As you will hear

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,328
The path to building their company was fraught with all kinds of challenges

71
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Among them

72
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Rampant sexism

73
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
And even harassment

74
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
Recently been opening up about that

75
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
Their Story begins just after she graduates College

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
And job working as a junior analyst

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
For the hotel company

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Starwood

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,088
About a year into my time at Starwood when I was 22

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
I had this thesis that we had entered

81
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
The experience

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Economy

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
And people were getting married later and starting to value

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Experiences

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Like travel

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Over owning

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
And so I had an idea at the time

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
To Launch

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
The first honeymoon

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
History in the world

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
Where couples could register for

92
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,712
Their honeymoons and their friends and family could contribute by

93
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,552
You know paying for scuba diving or paying for a massage in Hotel night

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
As opposed to buying them pots and pans

95
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
So

96
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
As a 22 year old I

97
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Was really passionate about this idea

98
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
I emailed the president of Starwood

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
And I pitched him on this idea

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
To start a wedding business

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,055
Starwood where the Cornerstone of it would be with the first honeymoon registry just ever so

102
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
R22

103
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,711
That's that's incredibly precocious but was there anybody around you who is like

104
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
Hey stay in your lane or you know was there anybody was trying to

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Tell you to

106
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Oh yeah

107
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Several boxes of mine

108
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
We're telling me

109
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
To keep quiet and

110
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
One of

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
The experience is that really impacted me

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Was

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
I

114
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Had a female boss

115
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
And at the time I think she was like

116
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
35 or 36 so

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
Kind of about my age right now

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
And I would often

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Raise my hand in meetings and speak and make points

120
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
And

121
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
I remember her

122
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
Grabbing me after a meeting one day and

123
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
She said you know Jen I really want to give you some feedback

124
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,767
It's really important for your career

125
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,095
And I said oh you know I'd love to hear what's your feedback

126
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
And she said

127
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,447
You really need to shut up wow

128
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
You're a girl

129
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
And

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
It would be much more becoming

131
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
If you acted

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Sweet

133
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
In conversations

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
Because you know you're you're too confident you're too bold

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
And it's coming across the wrong way

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Hand of course

137
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
I didn't really know how to take this I mean I don't even know how I would take the

138
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
22 year olds I started hysterically crying I was in the middle of like an open floor

139
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Plan

140
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
And a more senior man

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Sami

142
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
I literally credit this guy for my entire career

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
He took me aside

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
And because I

145
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,367
Didn't even understand office politics at the time and like what I should and shouldn't say I kind of just blurted out

146
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Oh my God like

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,743
Just want to just told me X Y and Z and I repeated the entire conversation to him

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
And he said you know Jen

149
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
You keep doing what you're doing

150
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
Because that woman's going to be working for you one day

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Wow

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
She innocence gave me permission

153
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
To just act like myself

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
End

155
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Who I was as a 22 year old

156
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
The same person is who I am today it's the person who

157
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
How to creative idea about

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
The Experience economy and I wanted to share it

159
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:57,279
What are you doing with it with the idea you pitch this to the to the president of Starwood

160
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Yeah

161
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
I think he thought I was so

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Little bit crazy

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,263
For going in and pitching to him that his response was like yeah sure whatever

164
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
And I took that as a yes

165
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Wait he said

166
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
He didn't say yes he just said yeah that's interesting in you

167
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Went back to your

168
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Your desk and you started to

169
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Map out how this could happen

170
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
I started to work on it

171
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
I spent the next three years working on it

172
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
And

173
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,719
You know Starwood still participates in

174
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
The honeymoon registry

175
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
To this day

176
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Has taken it to a whole other level since I left

177
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,031
But it was such a fun experience for me to a work on something that I loved and was passionate about

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
Indeed be part of the process of creation

179
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247
So you are obviously on the fast track to like if you were still Starwood today you might be running the place and you were

180
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Doing this at such a young age

181
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Why did you

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Decide to leave after after a couple years

183
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
I always thought

184
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
But I would go to Business School

185
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Both my parents have gone to Business School

186
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
And so I thought that the track was you work for 4 years

187
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Between college and then you go to business

188
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Also when

189
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
I was at Starwood first

190
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
3 + years I applied to business

191
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
School and I got into Harvard

192
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
So here's a question for you about

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
Cuz we're going to get I want to ask you about of course what happens business coaches

194
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
The Incredibles 2

195
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Rent the Runway but

196
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
The vast majority of the of the entrepreneurs that would have been on the show

197
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Did not go to business

198
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,023
You had all this incredible experience and you were really ambitious and you were

199
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Entrepreneurial already

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Why did you think you needed

201
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Take to go to Business School

202
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Well first

203
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
I

204
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
Have always had Big Dreams for my career but I

205
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Didn't exactly know what those dreams were

206
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
You know

207
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
Sara Blakely was

208
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
A guest on your program and

209
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
She's someone who

210
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,599
Has always been an inspiration to me I remember being a

211
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Younger girl

212
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
And

213
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
Seeing her on Oprah

214
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,791
And she had this amazing business but she also like

215
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Seem like a real person

216
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Who cared about getting married and having kids and

217
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
Having friends and having a social life and

218
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
That was really important to me

219
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
I was still fearful

220
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
That you had to make a choice

221
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Between having

222
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
An incredible career as a woman or having a family

223
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
And I've always wanted both

224
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,183
So incensed going to business school with a chance for you to really think those things through

225
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
To think it through to get that kind of extra

226
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
Potentially stamp of approval that I thought that I needed

227
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,191
I had lots of opportunities that I could go into

228
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
Different kinds of companies in different fields

229
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
But I really wanted the time to

230
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
To think about like

231
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Where do I want to spend my time

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Like what am I most passionate about

233
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Yeah

234
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
You are why you were at at Harvard Business School you met the person who would become

235
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
The co-founder of Rent the Runway Jennifer Fleiss

236
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Yes how did you know

237
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
So it's a really funny story my sister Becky

238
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,911
Prior to me going to business school put a Post-It note on my pillow one night

239
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
With

240
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
Jenny Fleiss has maiden name on it

241
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Which was Jenny Carter

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
And

243
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
She said that you have to meet this girl when you go to Business School

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Because a friend of a friend of hers new Jenny Carter

245
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
And my response to Becky

246
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
At the time was

247
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Keto while meter if I meter

248
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Needless to say

249
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Jenny was one of the first people I met at Harvard

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
The school because we were placed in the same section

251
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
Because her name had been on a Post-It note for me I was like oh my God you'll never believe this like

252
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
My sister told me we need to be friends

253
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
And we became really fast friends and

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
You know the rest is history and at what point did you say

255
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
What's your business together when we leave this place

256
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
So we were friends

257
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
We actually

258
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Through our birthdays together

259
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm in September of

260
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
That second year of business

261
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,023
School and in November of the secondary business school I went home for Thanksgiving

262
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
And I was in Becky's apartment

263
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
And Becky had just gone to a store and bought a dress

264
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
That was higher cost than her rent

265
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Azhar

266
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
Responsible older sister I was

267
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Embarking how

268
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
She should probably wear

269
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
One of the dress

270
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,295
This isn't her closet again as opposed to being in credit card debt

271
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
And her response to me was

272
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
You know everything in my closet is dead to me

273
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
I've been photographed in it

274
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
The photographs are up on Facebook and I need something new

275
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
You know Becky was a 25 year old

276
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
Like normal girl who lived in New York she wasn't a celebrity

277
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,847
But she was talking about being photographed and not being able to wear something again

278
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
And I like it was a lightbulb moment

279
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
For me

280
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Cuz I realized

281
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
I was having a conversation with my sister about the

282
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Experience

283
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Of wearing

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
An amazing dress up walking into a party

285
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
Feeling self-confident and feeling beautiful and that's

286
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
What she cared about

287
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,607
And she didn't care about the actual ownership of the items in

288
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Her closet

289
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
The other things

290
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
She cared about was the

291
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Photograph that would exist after the party

292
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
That she could post on

293
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
Facebook and kind of share with everyone she knew how awesome she felt and how,

294
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
But she felt it that way

295
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
Sweating with this idea happened on a Saturday night

296
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
I go back to school on Monday

297
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
I happen to have lunch that day with Jenny

298
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
We were talking about our weekend

299
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Cuz I was like oh I had this idea like

300
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
What if we rent a dress

301
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
She responded on this sounds fun

302
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
You know that's like

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Work on this idea together

304
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Who do you think we should call

305
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
To figure out if it's a good idea

306
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
And

307
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
I said you know we should really call Diane Von Furstenberg

308
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,895
And like the famous fashion designer

309
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Jennifer

310
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Do you know Diane Von Furstenberg

311
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
And I said

312
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,111
Obviously I don't know Diane Von Furstenberg but we could probably figure out her email address

313
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,231
You could have this point figure out anyone's email address in the entire world

314
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,583
So Jenny and I wrote an email that afternoon

315
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
Too many different versions of Diane Von Furstenberg email address

316
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,823
And we basically said hey we're two women at Harvard Business School we have an idea

317
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
We'd love to come in and talk to you about it

318
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
This is where luck

319
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Plays into

320
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
To the situation

321
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Because

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
She or someone from her office

323
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Open that email

324
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
She responded I'll see you tomorrow at 5 p.m. tomorrow at 5 p.m.

325
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Yep and we

326
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Drove down

327
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
To New York

328
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
That next day

329
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
Put on our dvf dresses

330
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,983
And walked into her office and introduced ourselves as the co-founders of Rent the Runway

331
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
You have a name

332
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
You came up with a name

333
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Yeah we just

334
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
We did everything very quickly

335
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Now we didn't really have a structured idea

336
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
So

337
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,807
You know we were kind of iterating the idea

338
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Baidu

339
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
And

340
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,671
The initial idea actually a witch

341
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,279
You know we've never really told the initial idea was what if we could rent the dresses

342
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,631
That she is selling on her website so what if we powered rental

343
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Her

344
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
Dvf.com

345
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
You know when we went

346
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
To chat with her

347
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
She

348
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Was not too thrilled about

349
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
The idea of

350
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
Renting clothes in general and thought that it would

351
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Cannibalize her

352
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
Retail sales and it would dilute

353
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Herbrand +

354
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
She was ready to end the meeting with us after a few minutes and

355
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
I started asking her questions about what she disliked about the idea what was

356
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
She scared about end

357
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
By the end of what was

358
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Almost a

359
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
You know hour-and-a-half conversation

360
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
We learned

361
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
That

362
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
A lot of her customers were in their fifties and sixties

363
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
And not

364
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
If we were to build a business that could

365
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Make her relevant

366
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
To put

367
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Her products

368
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Into the hands

369
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
News of women

370
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
In their teens twenties thirties and forties

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,303
But that might be interesting to her and she might want to work with us

372
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
So what's next for you guys

373
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Nervous I mean

374
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
Just that you said business school students mean

375
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,639
I can imagine like what that would feel like to walk into that room and and try to get them keep her attention in

376
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Get her excited

377
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
What's a funny story so

378
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
At that first meeting I've always learned you know when you're in the first meeting schedule second meeting

379
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,671
So when we're in the first meeting we scheduled the conversation for a few weeks later with her

380
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Fast forward a few weeks and we're driving to the meeting

381
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
And

382
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
And we got a call while we're in the car

383
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
From her system

384
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
And we're on the West Side Highway where about

385
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
40 blocks from her office

386
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
And her system calls and says Dad no longer wants to see you

387
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
And

388
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
I said oh you know well

389
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
We're on our way

390
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
We'll just come in and say hi

391
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
And persistence like

392
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
No

393
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
She really doesn't want to see you

394
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
She's not interested in this idea

395
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
Can I set

396
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
We're just around the corner like

397
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
What will the stop by for a second

398
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
And again her sister

399
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
Very firmly said she doesn't want to see you

400
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
What do you not understand

401
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
And I said we're cutting off or cutting off and I hung up

402
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
And then I

403
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
Dead down the West Side Highway and we were

404
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
At her office and we just showed up

405
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
Wait most people in that situation would have just been like

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Crashed

407
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
Would have felt so dejected like I don't know what I would and would have just said well forget it forget dialysis move on

408
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
How did you not

409
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,887
Feel that how did you how are you able to just say

410
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
We're just going to do that for no walk in there

411
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
Well Jenny initially was actually started to cry and was a little bit upset about the situation which I polish them

412
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,199
People would yeah which I think is the much more natural reaction

413
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
And

414
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
I was like we're just going to do this what do we have to lose like

415
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
What's the worst thing in the world we show up and she doesn't meet us what if you walked in there and they were like security please a Scorpio

416
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Flipping out

417
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
Great then we have a story that we could tell all of our friends

418
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,679
When we come back what actually happened when Jen and Jenny

419
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Finally showed up at the house on 1st and Briggs Avenue

420
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567

443
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
Hey welcome back to how I built this

444
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
From NPR

445
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Before the break

446
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Jen was talking about how she and her co-founder Jenny

447
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Basically

448
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,399
Busted into Diane Von Furstenberg xoffice to have a second meeting

449
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
An amazingly

450
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Diane agreed to meet with them

451
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Pretty good advice

452
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,639
Actually that was the meeting where she told us you know I don't want you to do

453
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Do this on my website

454
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
You are going to have to

455
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
You sell this idea

456
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
The other

457
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,879
Designers and get lots of people on board if I'm going to do this to

458
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,951
So in a sense in that meeting she gave us permission

459
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
To make it a consumer-facing business and to approach

460
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
The rest of the industry

461
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
Reroute your business plan right right there

462
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Yeah

463
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,799
So did you walk out of her office would like names or contacts or did you just walk out of her office

464
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
This is this is clarified we now know

465
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
We're heading

466
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
Well we did ask her

467
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
4

468
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,599
Some introductions and I think that she introduced us to one or two people in the industry

469
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,951
We then would meet with those people and we'd ask them for introductions and so on and so forth

470
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
But we continue to just cold coffee

471
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,863
People so one of the next people that I cold called was

472
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
The

473
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
President of Neiman Marcus

474
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Because

475
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
He was Botha HBS alarm so I had access to his

476
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Is email address

477
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
And I thought that you know if this whole

478
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Rent the Runway thing

479
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Falls through like

480
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Maybe I could work for Jim gold Neiman Marcus

481
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
What he say

482
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,183
He said yeah this is a really good idea women have been renting the runway from my stores for decades

483
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,791
It's called buying something keeping the tags on and then returning it to the store

484
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
Which probably cost them

485
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Millions of dollars

486
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Yes

487
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Kind of the dirty secret of retail

488
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,007
That the return rate especially addresses

489
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
And special occasion

490
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
A tire is extremely high

491
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Cash pot for second a-10s this question which is

492
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,015
I'm wearing the outfit I'm wearing today like I've worn this in the last

493
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Few days

494
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,367
I have no shame about it and obviously there's a difference

495
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
Society has different standards for men and women

496
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
What is this about what does thing where where

497
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Women

498
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Do you like they can't wear the same dress

499
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Two different function

500
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
I really think that

501
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
There's a value that women place on

502
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Self-expression

503
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
And that clothes make

504
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
You feel a certain way about yourself

505
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
You put on an amazing outfit in the morning and

506
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,784
It makes you feel powerful or beautiful or sexy or relaxed or however you want to feel that day

507
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
There's just a general value in

508
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,696
Our society right now around individuality and self-expression

509
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
And so the way that you're going to achieve that

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
With fashion

511
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Is Viva variety

512
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
So I had seen

513
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
At the time and it's even more true today

514
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,056
Set the way that women were accessing variety and individuality was

515
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Through

516
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Fast fashion

517
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
An off-price

518
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Because the only place

519
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
That you could buy a quantity of items

520
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Was at a place that was selling them for a very cheap

521
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
Forever 21 or

522
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Exactly

523
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
So I think sit when you don't have to buy something

524
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
It allows you

525
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
To try

526
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
New things to constantly be playful to Experiment 2

527
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
Try things that are in colors or in

528
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
Trends were you know different kinds

529
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
The styles that you never would

530
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Because they're irrational

531
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
So with Rent the Runway

532
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
It's like a Willy Wonka land of fashion

533
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
Then you can have whatever you want whenever you want it

534
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Let's say you have a job in

535
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Curfew you have

536
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
A party you have a wedding you're going to

537
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
You're saying I wanted to arrive at my home on

538
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,720
September 15th and I'm going to wear it and use it for a few days and then I'm going to run

539
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,536
And it's about 10% of the

540
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Retail price

541
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
So how did you know for sure that

542
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Are the women will be interested

543
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
In like

544
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
Doing this mean did you get any research

545
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,104
No we never did research in an academic sense we did real life research which was

546
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
We went

547
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
To Bloomingdale's

548
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
We bought about a hundred dresses

549
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
All In

550
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Our own sizes

551
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,880
So that if this whole experiment didn't work out we would have an awesome new wardrobe

552
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
We spent a lot of our savings on this

553
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
We

554
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
Hosted a pop-up

555
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
At Harvard undergrad

556
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,912
And we invited different groups of Harvard undergrads to the pop-up and

557
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,240
Idea behind this was to learn a

558
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
Will women rent dresses

559
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
B what are they rent how much will they pay

560
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
What brands do they want

561
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
And most importantly

562
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
If they do run

563
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
What happened

564
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Titties

565
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Garments

566
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Destroyed

567
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
Can you send them through the mail

568
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
How do you dry clean these items

569
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
And so on and so forth

570
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
This is like still like

571
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
Travis sing

572
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Like a no-brainer but

573
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
Is what 2008/2009

574
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,496
This our first pop-up was in April 2009

575
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,568
At that time Netflix would like mailing

576
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
DVDs in the mail so that was going on

577
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
Zappos

578
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
You could get shoes need to mail them back but was still

579
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
It wasn't like when it is now then it was still new

580
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
It was and

581
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
It feels

582
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,952
Both so long ago and also yesterday

583
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
So you got the The Descent right away that

584
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,656
This that this could work because these these undergraduates useless women were like yeah I want to read this

585
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,520
I got the sense that it would work because I saw the emotional effect

586
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
So in this pop-up I saw girls

587
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
You know

588
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Stripping down

589
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Trying on

590
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
These amazing dresses and

591
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Feeling

592
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Beautiful

593
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
And you saw it

594
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Their facial expression

595
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,232
They threw their shoulders back and they tussled their hair and they walked with a new sense of confidence

596
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Tencent

597
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,560
You know I really thought wow

598
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,192
This could be a business that isn't just about offering her irrational or smart choice

599
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
But it also can be a business that is

600
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,640
Delivering something emotional to her making her feel

601
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
Beautiful every single day

602
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,112
Founders choose to do it on their own

603
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,696
Like me like Gary Erickson from Clif bar or even Sara Blakely

604
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Thanks and she has a hundred percent of her company

605
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
But

606
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
You guys went for venture capital

607
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
Pretty quickly player Leon y

608
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
We had to

609
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:50,848
Raise money because we needed to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory

610
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
2 even

611
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Launch a business or twists whether it was

612
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
A viable

613
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
Idea

614
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:03,136
And I don't come from a family that has hundreds of thousands of dollars

615
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Savings

616
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Especially

617
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
King of savings that they're going to invest in their daughters

618
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
Crazy idea

619
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:15,680
Until when you were pitching venture capitalist how much money were you looking to raise it in the first round

620
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,056
We raised 1.75 million dollars

621
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
What could you do is build a website right

622
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
You could buy initial inventory in

623
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
Various-sized runs with some depth

624
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Because we knew we needed many

625
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,136
Different designers we needed a selection right you weren't going to come and start renting

626
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
If there were only

627
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
5 units of inventory on the site

628
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
We could hire some people

629
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
We could launch a website

630
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
That was about it and take photos of the dresses and put them on the web

631
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
Tell us another funny story until 2 weeks

632
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
Before the website launched we didn't realize that we would have to take photos at the end of

633
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,616
We thought of course in this industry

634
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
There's some centralized plant that takes photos of this how ridiculous is it that every retailer would have to photograph

635
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
This inventory over and over again

636
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Needless

637
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
To say

638
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
We figure out like right before the website

639
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Meant to launch that we have no photos

640
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
And we

641
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,352
Put together a impromptu photo shoot where we

642
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,656
Found a photographer on Craigslist

643
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
Who ended up working with Rent the Runway for

644
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
6 years

645
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,664
Bring our own shoes and our own accessories to this photoshoot and

646
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Are you know initial team

647
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Of

648
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
5 employees in many interns at the time kind of

649
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Figure out how to do it

650
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
So once you

651
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,000
Watch how do you get the word out how do you how do you get people to even know what this says

652
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Hustling

653
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
So was the hustle the hustle was we wanted to build

654
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Alyssa

655
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Of as many women as

656
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Possible

657
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,848
You know the Sex in the City movie had come out that summer

658
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
And we would

659
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,760
Go to movie theaters with women who were attending that movie and we would get their email addresses we would

660
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Convince friend

661
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
Just send us email addresses of other friends

662
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,184
They're so like we were really doing anything and everything

663
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
So what are the names that was on this list

664
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,072
That we had built it Rent the Runway had

665
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,632
A at newyorktimes.com

666
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
And

667
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
I was like wow like there's someone who works at the New York

668
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:30,592
What timezone is email address and I looked her up and I saw that she was a twenty-two-year-old technology

669
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Reporter

670
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
Invite her in

671
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
Maybe she can write about Rent the Runway

672
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
So we met with her and we decided we were going to give her a story

673
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
And

674
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
I

675
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Thought

676
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
That

677
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
If Jenny and I were photographed

678
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
For this article

679
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Potentially we could be on the front page of the business

680
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
If it was a photo that

681
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Two of you

682
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Yes

683
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Because it was a technology

684
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,984
Reporter and no women are ever covered in the Technologies

685
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
So

686
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
I

687
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,152
Say to this reporter oh maybe you know you should take maybe you could take a photograph of us

688
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
At the kuantan port warehouse

689
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
The dry cleaner

690
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
So we put on like these crazy dresses

691
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
And

692
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
We showed up when the

693
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
Photographer

694
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
I showed up to

695
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
To the dry cleaner

696
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
And we

697
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Stewart on ladders

698
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,560
And we told the photographer to take a photo of us on ladders

699
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
In front of

700
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Kind of the

701
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Array of addresses

702
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Does that we're on the kind of dry cleaning

703
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Machine

704
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
And

705
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
Because the photo was so

706
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Utterly absurd

707
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,664
It ended up on the front page of the business section and

708
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,272
The headline A1 photo on nytimes.com

709
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,904
So we had a hundred thousand people sign up for Rent the Runway off of that story wow

710
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,280
People making orders yes

711
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,864
Did you have the inventory to handle all the orders no

712
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
So what you do

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,240
We raised more money so because of of

714
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Hustling

715
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:08,384
To get this story in the luck of ending up on the front page of the New York Times

716
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
We met our first year sales projections in 3 weeks

717
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,784
And we had a clamoring of

718
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
Venture Capital investors

719
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,672
We're kind of coming into our office pitching us on

720
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
Siri say so we got we have gone from

721
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
You know a very undesirable investment to

722
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
Black people

723
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Showing up

724
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
At the elevator

725
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
In our building

726
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
To meet with us unannounced wow

727
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,384
Because they wanted to pounce on the deal

728
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
I mean both you and

729
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Unfortunately

730
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,088
Still rare in in the startup world and they are your two women

731
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
Bleeding a huge company and end

732
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
The time when you were raising money

733
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
Did you ever get the sense from venture capitalist who presumably most

734
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Leslie Mann

735
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
That I don't know they were like

736
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
I'm a bit dismissive or

737
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
Condescending or

738
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
You know

739
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
I know treat you differently

740
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,432
Yeah we had several different very condescending conversations one

741
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,016
In which a partner at a very

742
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,880
Prestigious firm took my hand into his and he said you know this is so adorable

743
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,024
You're going to get to wear such pretty dresses this must be so fun for you how did you react

744
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
We both froze a little bit

745
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
We were very polite

746
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
And we walked out and we said you know thanks for

747
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
The feedback no of course we never

748
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
Interacted with

749
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:49,248
This former this investor again we never pitched them on any subsequent round we were like kind of good riddance to these people

750
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
So there's an element of

751
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
You know we

752
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Hydac

753
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
The capital

754
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
We had choices

755
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Because the business was growing

756
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
And

757
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
That's a privilege

758
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
I read an article that you that one investor says feel like

759
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
About about this idea

760
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Well that's something that we heard all the time

761
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
That wasn't one investor that was most

762
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Let me talk to my wife

763
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
My daughter or my admin

764
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
Those were the three

765
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
You know

766
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
Target customers that we would hear and

767
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Let me tell you why eat

768
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Is problematic

769
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
Number one the wife of a venture capitalist

770
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
What is the billionaire

771
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
So the wife of a venture capitalist

772
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Is not Mike Target

773
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,168
Write the daughter of a venture capitalist in most cases

774
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
This is about 12

775
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
Because most Venture capitalists are

776
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
When they're in the prime of their careers their kind of

777
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
45 to

778
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
50

779
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
So

780
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
You know their daughter is not a great Target

781
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Either

782
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
And their admin admins who work

783
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,112
In the Venture Capital industry cuz it's such a prick

784
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Prestigious job

785
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
Are often women who are in their 50s and 60s

786
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Again

787
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
Not women who were in my target demo so

788
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
We would

789
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Preempt

790
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
.

791
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
By showing videos

792
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
Inviting these investors

793
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,800
To some of our pop up show them who discussed

794
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
So that they really got a son

795
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
Thanks for who we were catering to

796
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
That there's been a lot of

797
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,272
A lot of attention recently to

798
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Tula

799
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
Roguish culture of

800
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
Venture capital in Silicon Valley

801
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
The end

802
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,304
And how women are are finally in a publicly being able to come out and talk more about

803
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Their experiences

804
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
Did you experience some of that

805
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Culture in in this process

806
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
I through the process of building

807
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
Renttherunway was sexually harassed

808
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
I'm by one individual

809
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
And I'm happy to

810
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
Share that experience

811
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
However I will say that

812
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
I've had interactions with

813
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,928
Dozens and dozens of venture capitalist at

814
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
Dozens of firms and

815
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
This was

816
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Just one individual

817
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
So

818
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
The

819
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,656
Far far far majority of my interaction

820
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Have been

821
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,800
Incredibly positive but I was in a situation once where I was kind of

822
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,664
Proposition sent sexual text messages

823
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Trying to raise my Rent the Runway

824
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
While I was building the company yes from someone in the investor Community sending you text messages like

825
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
Let's go on a date or whatever it was

826
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
God and things that are more explicit than that

827
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Toot toot sissy to get those

828
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
I was

829
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
I thought that it was

830
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:53,568
Inappropriate and fairly bizarre given that it was happening over text message so there was

831
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
Evidence created

832
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
Now there was also

833
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
You know conversations that were happening in person

834
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
That

835
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,808
We're also threatening and

836
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
Very bizarre

837
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Did you just

838
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
Ignore it was there anything you could have

839
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
Did you feel like you could really do anything about it except just ignore it

840
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
So I initially

841
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Ignored it

842
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
And that was the plan

843
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
I was planning on ignoring it in

844
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
You know

845
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Decided you know I was going to keep it silent

846
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
And then

847
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
This

848
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Person

849
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Decided to

850
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
To call one of my board members up on the phone

851
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
And so you know

852
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
John never responds to me

853
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,856
And I think that this is a real problem and

854
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,256
She's a really unresponsive CEO and she's probably she's doing this to me she's probably doing this other people and

855
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,840
He really challenged my behavior as a CEO

856
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Actually that board member

857
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Came into my office to give me

858
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Feedback

859
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
And say I need to be more responsive

860
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Which

861
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Was

862
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,616
My instantaneous reaction was

863
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Oh my God I can't believe

864
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Fattest person

865
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,808
After being rejected by making me sexual advances is now trying to ruin my career

866
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
And just a minute

867
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,976
How Jen handled that very tricky situation

868
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,048
I'm guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this

869

Hope to see you there

889
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

890
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Gyros

891
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
So in those early days if Rent the Runway

892
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,432
Jenn Hyman face the situation where one of our investors was

893
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
When she ignored his advances

894
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,112
Took it out on her he actually complained about her to a member of her board

895
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
She decided to be

896
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
Totally transparent about what was going on

897
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
I

898
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,120
I showed this board member the text messages

899
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
At that time

900
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Basically

901
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
You know ask my board member

902
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
How how they like me to respond

903
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
What do board members

904
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,152
I mean the board member was shocked I bet

905
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
I proceeded to tell everyone else in my board

906
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
As well as some

907
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
Key Executives who

908
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,392
We're working with me at Rent the Runway at the time

909
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
The board was

910
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,488
Unbelievably supportive

911
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,560
And we decided that we were

912
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
Not going to do business anymore with this individual or his firm

913
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:38,336
So there's that form of sexual harassment and I think that that's a lot of what's been getting recent media cup

914
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
End

915
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
Hopefully by nature of a lot of very

916
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Brave women

917
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Speaking out right now

918
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
That sort of sexual harassment will

919
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,696
Stamped Out of the industry in one way that I think over time

920
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
That it needs to be stamped out as bi

921
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
Diversifying the sources of capital making sure that

922
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
50%

923
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
Investors are women but let's put that aside.

924
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Just for a second

925
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
The second form of

926
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Sexual

927
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Harassment

928
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Flash

929
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
Gender discrimination

930
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Is way more subtle

931
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
And it's way more difficult

932
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
But for insta

933
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Overall

934
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
I have seen mail founders

935
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Receive

936
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
You know sometimes

937
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
More mentorship

938
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Or

939
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
More

940
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Chances

941
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
Is to be successful they get more

942
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,216
Strikes against them before their investors kind of pull the plugs

943
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
In a lot of cases

944
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
Women are only given

945
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
You know it's a one Striker you're out as this

946
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
CEO and founder

947
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
There are situations where

948
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,040
I've now come to understand that a lot of how deals get done

949
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,368
And how companies let they get acquired is

950
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
Someone is saying something like oh you should really meet the

951
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,512
This guy he's a Visionary he's incredible yet get to know him

952
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
And

953
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
I think across-the-board

954
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
More of those

955
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,448
Comments are being made about male entrepreneurs than they are about females

956
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Vsac

957
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Society

958
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
Feel uncomfortable

959
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,872
Using the words Visionary or brilliant

960
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
To describe women

961
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
That's not always in

962
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Tensional I think it's

963
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Ingrained in

964
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
People I would say in in in a lot of different instances

965
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
People have actually genuinely been trying to be helpful

966
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
To me like there was a time early in my career where

967
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
An investment firm

968
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
Beto sesame

969
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
OG and you know you should really meet

970
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
These other

971
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,336
Entrepreneurs are around your own age their brilliant you can learn a lot from them

972
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,664
They're building incredible companies they're going to change the world

973
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Now all of those

974
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Entrepreneurs were men and they were kind of

975
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
Breakfast is being Geniuses brilliant excetera

976
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
And

977
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:04,000
The same firm never introduced me in that same way to the same entrepreneurs even though we were at similar 10

978
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
On your end

979
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Similar stages in our company

980
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
The irony is a lot of

981
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,656
Those guys their businesses

982
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
You know aren't around anymore

983
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
And

984
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
You know I'm the one who still chugging

985
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
I don't think that they were

986
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
Trying to be intentionally

987
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Sexist

988
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
It's just that

989
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
There's a shade to which we

990
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
We all operate

991
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,576
That puts women at a bit of a

992
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
It's really amazing in you

993
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
It it it speaks to the this like

994
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Perception of a power dynamic

995
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
It's so

996
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Prevalent

997
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
In the end Adventure World

998
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
I think that those power dynamics

999
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Exist in so many different in Des

1000
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
3 up

1001
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
I don't think that it's

1002
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Just a

1003
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,080
Silicon Valley or technology problem

1004
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
And that's why

1005
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
I think that the more

1006
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Egregious

1007
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
Sending you a text message in the middle of the night

1008
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Asking to

1009
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Sleep with you sort of

1010
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Sexual harassment

1011
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
Hopefully

1012
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Can

1013
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Peace

1014
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Stamped Out via just

1015
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
Being more vocal about it

1016
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,071
I think so that the more subtle

1017
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Form of

1018
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Harassment

1019
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Slashed

1020
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Discrimination or just lack of opportunity

1021
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Is actually the

1022
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
Harder problem to solve

1023
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
This problem it's

1024
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
The reason why

1025
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,407
Only 4% of venture capital dollars are going

1026
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Towards women and

1027
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,503
You know very very few investors are women

1028
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
So

1029
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
You know we need to fundamentally

1030
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
Versify

1031
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Who has access to

1032
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
The power of was Axl

1033
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,743
What's the capital in order to get a diversity of ideas and

1034
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
There is out there

1035
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Yeah

1036
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,351
And obviously you have had incredible

1037
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,399
Success despite the challenges

1038
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,727
That you faced and women in in in Texas

1039
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
As usual.

1040
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
Begin to develop as a leader as a CEO

1041
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,711
How did you how did you make that transition how did you figure out how to get to manage Lots

1042
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
I think that

1043
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,831
It is a continuous work in progress

1044
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:10,207
I had never manage people across the diversity of functions that we have it Rent the Runway

1045
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,815
Rent the Runway is primarily a technology & logistics company

1046
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,399
If 1200 employees 10 employees are in my fashion Department

1047
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
And

1048
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,311
Hundreds are in my Logistics Department hundreds are in my engineering department

1049
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
And these are areas

1050
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
In which I had no experience

1051
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
End

1052
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:35,295
One thing that I've learned is that leadership

1053
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:40,671
Evolved over time for small being a leader of a 1200 person company is different

1054
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
Then being a leader of 100% company

1055
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,375
And so I have to really evolve even though I've had the same title for 8 plus years like

1056
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
There's so many things.

1057
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
You know I've done wrong along the way

1058
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
And

1059
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
I think that the thing that has

1060
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,383
Made me grow and develop is

1061
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
The recognition

1062
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Of

1063
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Failure

1064
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
And

1065
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
Desire to

1066
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
Improve in the desire to get better

1067
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
I don't want people to have the impression that this was

1068
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
Is all

1069
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
You know you do

1070
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
Freda From Success to success.

1071
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
Easy never know

1072
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Low point

1073
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
It's because I have been like with any company

1074
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
And

1075
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
And in 2000

1076
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
15

1077
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
You got some some tough press

1078
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
About

1079
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Some people who left the company

1080
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,431
They were quotes newspapers calling it a Amin culture and

1081
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
And

1082
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
And things like that

1083
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
From some of these employees who left to that

1084
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
Which would hurt by tweeting that

1085
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
That stuff was sobibor

1086
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,975
Criticizing you and and your and your management style leadership

1087
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
It was

1088
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,559
The most difficult experience

1089
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
Of my life actually

1090
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,423
It was such a difficult time

1091
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Because

1092
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
As a woman

1093
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
There's two things they could really call you as a woman

1094
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
They could call you the B word

1095
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Or they could say you're in it

1096
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Never really had a

1097
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,039
Had a fear of someone calling me an idiot

1098
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
But I do value myself

1099
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
For how I treat others

1100
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
So to be called mean

1101
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
+ 2

1102
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
You know

1103
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,631
Be quoted as having a Mean Girls culture at the company

1104
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Was so

1105
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
Unsettling and sad and horrible to me

1106
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,079
Cuz it's the thing that's the most important to me

1107
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Pino

1108
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
What had been happening at

1109
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
At the time

1110
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Was

1111
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
The company was going through

1112
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Quite

1113
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Painful and difficult transition

1114
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
From being a

1115
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
You know

1116
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
One phase of a startup to trying to develop some sense of entering our teen years are adolescent years

1117
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,935
And I started to realize that I needed to

1118
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
Make the tough calls

1119
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
End

1120
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Fire some people

1121
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
Was very unsettling to people

1122
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Because

1123
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
We give men permission

1124
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,503
As leaders and a CEOs

1125
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,087
To make the tough choices you know with women

1126
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,903
We don't give them as much permission

1127
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
To make those tough decisions

1128
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,255
And we often when when we do make those decisions

1129
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
We're often labeled as

1130
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
The B word

1131
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
Etc so

1132
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
It certainly was a low point

1133
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
But

1134
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
Lead to the biggest outpouring

1135
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
Of support of ever had

1136
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
It led to more

1137
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
Courage around

1138
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
My own decision making

1139
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Because

1140
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,063
I led the company into the best place it's ever been

1141
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
And

1142
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
In a sense it makes the future less scary because that article or

1143
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Reversion of it

1144
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
It will come out again

1145
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,119
And the next time it comes out

1146
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,423
It's just not going to have the same impact

1147
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
On me

1148
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,775
You mentioned earlier in the interview how

1149
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
You always wanted to

1150
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
Run a successful company

1151
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Start a successful company but also

1152
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,247
Have a family and a kid and you did that Yoo-hoo

1153
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
You have a child and a partner and

1154
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
How have you

1155
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Figured out how to

1156
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
To do in the way you wanted to

1157
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
First of all let's backtrack

1158
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,351
To being 28 and having the idea for run the runway and I just want to tell the real story here

1159
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,447
I because I think that a lot of women to go through this and end

1160
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
They don't talk about it

1161
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,567
One of the major considerations that I had

1162
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
In starting Rent the Runway

1163
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Was

1164
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,455
Is this a smart idea for me

1165
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,783
Because if Rent the Runway is successful

1166
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
Will I ever be able to get married

1167
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
I was always confident that I would

1168
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
Turn Rent the Runway into a

1169
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,071
Consumer behavior that millions of people did and that I would be able to

1170
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,911
You know I still believe we're going to build a multi-billion-dollar company

1171
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,751
But at the very very beginning when Rent the Runway launch

1172
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
I had been dating someone

1173
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,383
From Harvard Business School who I was very much in love with

1174
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
The day that

1175
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:23,039
Rent the Runway came out and we were on the front page of the New York Times

1176
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,879
She broke up with me shortly thereafter

1177
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
Auntie told me

1178
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
That

1179
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
He

1180
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Realized

1181
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
That he didn't want to be with his equal

1182
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
So that was really

1183
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,959
Sad and disheartening cuz I was very in love with this

1184
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
6%

1185
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
And that's what led into the sphere

1186
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
No

1187
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,383
Sphere was completely

1188
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,455
Unfounded and I had no issues

1189
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,807
You know falling in love while building Rent the Runway I just think that

1190
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
It

1191
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Paralyzed

1192
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
The number one priority in my life

1193
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,255
Has always been having a family and having kids

1194
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
So

1195
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,351
The amount of happiness that I have now

1196
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,935
Having a daughter I just got back from maternity leave last week

1197
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
I'm engaged to the love of my life

1198
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
I can't even

1199
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Describe to you

1200
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
The

1201
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
Level of

1202
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Joy

1203
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,943
But it brings into my life on a daily basis

1204
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
To truly

1205
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
Have all of my dreams

1206
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
To come true

1207
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Plaster you guys

1208
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
Pad Thai

1209
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
Which I should point out

1210
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Exceedingly rare soap

1211
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
And

1212
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
I mean your

1213
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
Revenues

1214
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Over a hundred million dollars

1215
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
La Quinta

1216
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Public reports

1217
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
Devaluation of companies I don't even know what it is

1218
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Do you know what it is

1219
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,079
I do know what it is

1220
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
Yeah but it's it's

1221
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Probably higher than you

1222
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Ever imagine

1223
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,991
Even though it it it may still be on

1224
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Paper

1225
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
This

1226
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,855
Thing that you felt that you in NN Jenny built

1227
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
Has made both of you rich

1228
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
Show me you are even though babe

1229
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
Spam paper you are rich your rich

1230
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,767
You did not grow up that

1231
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,655
Well being rich on paper is very different than being rich and reality so let's talk in the future

1232
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Because

1233
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,239
I didn't grow up saying I want to found a company

1234
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,639
I had this idea for renttherunway I saw that it was mission-driven I saw that it was driving self-confidence and making with

1235
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:29,503
Women feel incredible about themselves and I knew that I had to commit my life to that

1236
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
And I'm really proud

1237
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Got

1238
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
We have

1239
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
Had many

1240
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
Different women

1241
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:42,815
Leave Rent the Runway and then raise their own venture capital and start their own companies and go after their own dream

1242
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
And

1243
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Jenny and I

1244
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
2 years ago

1245
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
Decided to start a foundation

1246
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Where we've raised

1247
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
Millions of dollars to

1248
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,359
Support other female entrepreneur

1249
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,663
Scaling their companies and we've now helped

1250
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,223
Thousands of women throughout the United

1251
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
In scaling their organization

1252
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
So

1253
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
This mission

1254
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Of

1255
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:11,999
Empowering women and making women feel confident is the actual thing that I care

1256
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
Now if it happens to be

1257
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
That Rent the Runway brings

1258
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
With me

1259
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,799
The ability to provide for my family and thank my parents that would be wonderful

1260
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,871
But honestly if it amounts to nothing it is

1261
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,223
The absolute best experience of my life and I would do it over a million times

1262
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,599
Jenn Hyman founder of Rent the Runway

1263
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,415
By the way her co-founder Jennifer Fleiss recently left

1264
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
The company

1265
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
It was amicable

1266
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,023
Both Jen and Jennifer each own 13

1267
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
Percent of the company

1268
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,399
Put them on the Forbes list of the richest self-made women to watch

1269
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
Renttherunway isn't just profitable

1270
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,287
It's also become America's single largest dry cleaner

1271
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,615
Dresses from 500 different designers

1272
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Including

1273
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
So it took a while to convince her

1274
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,967
Diane Von Furstenberg

1275
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:10,111
Please do stick around because it just a moment to hear from you about the things

1276
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
Your building

1277
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,207
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors MailChimp

1278
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,023
MailChimp is so much more than female

1279
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
They've outgrown their name

1280
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,143
With automation ad campaigns and audience management

1281
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
MailChimp could help your business

1282
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
Outgrow its name to

1283
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
Not just mail MailChimp

1284
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1285
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,783
I know for how you built that and today we're going to update the story we ran a while back with Monica

1286
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
Huarache in San Diego California

1287
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,671
And her story starts a few years ago when her daughter Leo was

1288
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
Packing to go overseas on a gap year program

1289
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,559
She was going to be traveling to 14 different countries

1290
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:57,215
Which meant that she was going to be living out of a suitcase so we needed to find the system where she would be very organized

1291
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:01,311
Tyson her travels to be able to survive out of a suitcase pretty much for the year

1292
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,151
This for me or maybe even you you know we can just

1293
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,503
Throw a bunch of clothes into a suitcase and forget about it but Monica

1294
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
She is in

1295
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
Probably organized

1296
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
I was a mathematician College

1297
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
And I was

1298
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,743
What was daring to order like in math is one solution

1299
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,583
Came to packing I just couldn't find the system we tried

1300
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,423
With Ziploc bags we tried many other packing cubes

1301
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,727
But you couldn't see your things

1302
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,823
And I wanted to turn a suitcase into a set of drawers

1303
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,151
And what Monica came up with was a modular set of

1304
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,551
Clear squishy plastic cubes that you can stack inside a suitcase and pull out by a

1305
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
Handle it when you open your suitcase you can see

1306
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
Everything from your suitcase and eventually Monica ran into a friend at a barbecue who happened to work with

1307
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,583
Factories in China so of course she showed him her plan

1308
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399
Then he says this looks really interesting

1309
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Then he took it to China

1310
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,079
You made a prototype for me I told him I wanted to clear and Wanda piping I wanted to have a handle

1311
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,615
And she made

1312
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
The first prototype

1313
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
Soon after that Marcus scrape together some money

1314
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,759
And placed an order for 14

1315
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
Thousand of these packing Cube

1316
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
And a few months later

1317
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
A truck driver pulled up

1318
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
In front of her house

1319
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,231
I thought I was getting maybe 60 boxes or something

1320
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,095
We had a 20-foot Container full of boxes on a bike

1321
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Oh my God what

1322
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:36,287
Did we do and that was the precise moment when Monica realized she'd forgotten one very crew

1323
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Crucial detail

1324
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:43,967
She had not gotten the word out about the packing cubes no I didn't have a single client I haven't sold us

1325
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Singlecue

1326
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,575
Fortunately her son Solomon had study business and marketing

1327
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
In college

1328
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,951
And so he stepped in and he said he said we are going to work really hard

1329
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,767
We're going to put it online and we're going to sell it

1330
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:02,911
So Solomon started to email Mommy bloggers about the cubes and one of them posted it on Pinterest

1331
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
And sure enough he says

1332
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
We just got you

1333
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,639
Six or seven orders in like that was a big deal at the time that was like wow like this is working you know

1334
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:17,503
And he actually liked the idea so much that Solomon bought the company you from his mom

1335
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,295
And he called it easy packing

1336
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
She still helps out with the accounting and her husband does the legal work

1337
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
And other kids how about you but Solomon

1338
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
How does the

1339
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Bulk of the work

1340
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
You know what it's been an amazing honor

1341
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,887
To work with my son I never thought I would work with my son

1342
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,959
If it hadn't been for him I would not have been able to do it

1343
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
That's Monica mizrachi

1344
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Easy packing

1345
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Today

1346
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,871
Her son Solomon and his fiance

1347
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
Company full time

00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
Monica Still helps out

1349
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,319

1350
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:57,183
Doubled their business selling over 10000 packing cubes in the past year alone
