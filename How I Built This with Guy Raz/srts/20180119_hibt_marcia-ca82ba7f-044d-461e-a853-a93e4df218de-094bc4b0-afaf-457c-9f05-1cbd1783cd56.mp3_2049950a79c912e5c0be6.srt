Few days

24
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
I treated myself to a facial

25
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
After an economics exam and I had saved 40 or $50 to go to this place that was suppose

26
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
Supposed to beat the be-all-and-end-all of facials and I remember walking into that place and the esthetician look through the lamp

27
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
At my skin what a pity

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
This is not a treat and I left feeling so horrendous and I remember to see my reflection in

29
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
My face is kind of raw and blotchy and thinking if I ever had a place like that I would know

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Make my customer care

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384

Small town in Canada to New York

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
With just three hundred bucks

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,128
Turn yourself into a Serial entrepreneur the founder of five companies

41
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Bliss cosmetics

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
According to the small business administration

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,512
There's a 50% chance that your business will fail within the first 5 years

44
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Took there some things that entrepreneurs do to maximize the chances that their businesses will succeed

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
Planet research the market

46
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
Play the way Arthur Blank and his partner Bernie Marcus did for nearly two years before they launched

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
The Home Depot

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
Or the way Jenn Hyman from Rent the Runway did tons of market research and proof of concept

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Testing long before she went to investors all of this raise the odds

50
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Past 5 years which brings us to Today Show because this is truly a story about someone

51
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
Never had a bigger plan Marcia Kilgore didn't set out to become an insanely successful

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Serial entrepreneur

53
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
She never sat down and said hey I'm going to start a day spa in a line of skin care products

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,808
I want to start for more companies she was a personal trainer who had a side hustle getting facials

55
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
And what happened to her happened organically it just evolved into something bigger and

56
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Bigger

57
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,376
Marcia actually grew up in Saskatoon Saskatchewan Canada on the map

58
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,472
Busy very cold place even by Canadian standards

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Anyway the pretty middle-class home

60
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
Dad was a real estate agent mom took care of the house

61
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,688
Until age 11 when Marcia's dad died

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
After battling cancer

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
So her mom went back to work and Marcia well she started working too which is how she became

64
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
To become a bodybuilder

65
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,752
Pounds I can probably quiet 300

66
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
It was it was actually a skill and a

67
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
David translated self into you know what I could you later so

68
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
It would give us helpful

69
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Well okay

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
So I think I've always loved a big challenge

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
French and when I was living in Saskatoon which was

72
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
A small City and there wasn't really much to

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
To do

74
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Mysa

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
5 Middlesex

76
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
Started dating a guy whose brother owned

77
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
A gym

78
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,215
And he said hey you should come down to the gym and workout I used to run a lot

79
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Okay well you know

80
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Let me

81
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Go down to the gym and check it out it's something to do

82
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Because really

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Hino Saskatoon

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
10 months of the year

85
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,551
Pretty cold and they're only two television channels back then so it was it was pretty dry

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
So I went down to the gym

87
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
And I remember them hooking me up with this

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Sam

89
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
Female bodybuilder her name is Sherry something and she was missed

90
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Canada bodybuilding at the time

91
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
And they gave me a couple of sessions with her

92
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Learn how to do all sorts of

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
In a different weight lifting

94
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Moves and routine

95
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
And she work me so hard it was a basement gym and I could not walk up the stairs to get out

96
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
And I just thought

97
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
You know

98
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759

This is like a

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
8 method

103
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
And apparently you became like a

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Weight class

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815

00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Don't laugh out loud

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Miss Moose Jaw

112
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
I said don't laugh

113
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,039
But you know the it was great because I could also I mean by Todd aerobics when I was a teenager as well

114
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Earn extra money I waitress

115
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
Start of Lent itself to many different things that

116
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
That were useful

117
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
And in what

118
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
What was the idea

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Did you

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Did you have jobs in

121
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Did you earn money in part because

122
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
You

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
I don't know felt like there was some Financial NC

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Security at home and that you

125
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
And it was a way for you to kind of have some control over your

126
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Own financial situation

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
I think that I knew my mother was under a lot of

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,599
You know just just from being a single mother and trying to make ends meet and I didn't want to be

129
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
A drain

130
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
And if I could

131
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,255
Pay my own way in terms of at least not asking her for any money

132
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
And that was something that made me feel you know that it was it was

133
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Relieving

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Stressing from her

135
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Certainly I never made enough to

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Pay the rent

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
But I didn't have to ask

138
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Schizophrenic

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Because you're in high school

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
And your body

141
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Aerobics

142
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
So you're already looking at like

143
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
The fitness type person as a teen

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
Then what was your

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Plan after high school did you did you go to college

146
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
What when I was

147
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,951
17 my sister who is living in New York at the time so this was my

148
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Oldest sister

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Jody

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
She told me that if

151
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
I could get accepted to Columbia University and get

152
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Pass

153
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
All the different entrance exams

154
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Then she would pay my tuition

155
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
Wow how was she able to do that she was a model she was living in New York City and making decent cash decent cash

156
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
So

157
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
I came to New York I had $300 in my pocket

158
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,367
And I was supposed to go to Columbia and that year unfortunately my sisters

159
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
Financial situation was not as strong as she thought it was going to be

160
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
And so as a hat

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
Applied for a student loan

162
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
For a foreign student early enough

163
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
It's too late for me to get a loan

164
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
So I kind of was in New York

165
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
With my 300 bucks

166
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,103
And no school to go to and I had to figure it out

167
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
And this was

168
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
Like 1987

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
1987

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
So you don't have money for school

171
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
No work

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,439
You know this is the interesting thing so I started

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
When I first arrived in New York

174
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
I got myself a gym membership

175
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,423
With the little money that I did have because of course once working out is part of your life you really happy

176
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
When you have to go

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
Pretty much every day for an hour Rescue start to

178
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
I kind of lose that endorphin

179
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,919
Dependency and so there's a really great Jim go better bodies

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
And I met a

181
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
Film director their name Douglas cave

182
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
We chatted in a while we were working out and at one point he said hey do you think

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,439
You could be my personal trainer cuz I want to look more like you

184
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
He was very tall and kind of lead and I was

185
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Probably a little bit more muscular but not bulky

186
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,167
I said he wanted to have a physique like mine and so he was my very first

187
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Personal training client

188
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
And then other people

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Drew Cami inter

190
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
You just meet you and I started

191
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
My sister then

192
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
You realize that I was

193
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Trainer and started to

194
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,503
Refer models and actresses and actors and stunt man and

195
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
We are all kinds of

196
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
People to miso

197
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
I ended up having you know

198
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
Quite a collection of interesting personalities

199
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Personal training clients

200
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
And started to build up the money that I needed

201
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Go to some part-time

202
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Classes at NYU

203
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
So

204
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Did you think

205
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
All right I'll do this I'll take some classes at NYU I'll be at

206
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
I'll trainer and then

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
But like long-term I'm going to do this

208
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Store that did you was that

209
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Even like part of the equation

210
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
I had no plan

211
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
I think I was in survival mode

212
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
I knew that

213
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,463
Doing personal training and getting up at 5 a.m. and sometimes having your last night at 9:30 at night and then

214
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,351
Sleeping maybe 5 and 1/2 hours and starting all over again and maybe going to a class somewhere during the day that was unsafe

215
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Sustainable

216
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
And I used to fall asleep in my

217
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Economics

218
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Because I was so tired

219
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
And then I started to develop

220
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Quiet

221
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
A bad case of acne and it was probably because New York can be so humid

222
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
I was running around all day

223
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,063
And you wanted to look decent to your put makeup on

224
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
And then go to peanuts

225
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Personal training session with someone where you're sweating and then you put more makeup on cuz you didn't have time to go home and wash your face in between that climb

226
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Find the next client so my skin got really bad

227
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
I want summer I treated myself

228
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
To a facial after an economics exam that I took at NYU but I had actually walked up

229
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
Town I had saved 40 or $50 to go to this place that was supposed to be the be-all-and-end-all facial

230
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
And I remember going in there and I had been under so much stress trying to write this exam studying really high

231
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
Hard working all the time you know paying for everything myself and I

232
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,791
This was supposed to be a real tree and I remember walking into that place laying down on the table

233
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
An esthetician booked through the lamp at my skin

234
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
And then she said what a pity

235
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
Okay this is not a treat she actually been proceeded to go out into the

236
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
Common area of that spot and bring in the spa manager

237
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
Who was a gentleman who came in and they both look through the lamp up my scanning and sort of Tifton Ono

238
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
What a disaster and I left feeling so horrendous and I remember taking the subway home

239
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
And as the subway pulled up in front of me you have to have the stainless steel side so you get your reflection and I remembered

240
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
See my reflection of my face is kind of raw and blotchy and thinking

241
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:31,199
If I ever had a place like that I would never make my customers feel bad about the

242
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
And

243
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
I remember

244
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
I decided

245
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
To take

246
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
The crash course

247
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
And skincare

248
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
And I took this

249
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
I think it was probably

250
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Play 3 or 4 weeks

251
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Crash course in

252
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Skin carrying a base

253
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
6 skincare and how to do facials

254
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
And

255
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
I

256
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,215
Started to convince my personal training clients after I would take them jogging or

257
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Giving me yoga

258
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
The classic

259
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Whatever it was

260
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
To let me practice

261
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Facials on them

262
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
An end

263
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
And likes

264
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
And you would have all the

265
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
You know I'm driving

266
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Haven't had a facial.

267
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
Ever I'm sorry

268
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Wechat

269
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Like showing up in pee

270
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
People's Apartments

271
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
All the supplies you need to give a

272
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
Facial Impressions picture that you were you lugging around like potions and lotions and things like that

273
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Oh yeah

274
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,263
I mean this was a huge bag of stuff first of all I care.

275
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,383
Steamer which is a very outdated piece of equipment I would never seen somebody's face now

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,247
Back then it was what everybody did and that was kind of the method that we learned and we thought

277
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
That was good for the skin

278
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
You know since then we've learned that it's not so good for the skin Tokay this steamer which was

279
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
We like a small

280
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Coffee machine

281
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
And then I would have probably 20 tubes in jars

282
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Cotton pads and

283
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Towels and

284
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
You know it was certified

285
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Like a giant bat

286
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
If you were going to go

287
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Hike the end of the trail

288
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
You can go hike that

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
I was probably carrying around that

290
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
Because I would then also bring my personal training app

291
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
30 kilos

292
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Wow

293
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
So you

294
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
So you had this life

295
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Disservice

296
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,511
Sides and go and why you are also a personal trainer and

297
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
I mean it at what point Did you sort of

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Start asking

299
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
People to pay you

300
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Furfrou

301
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
I don't think that any of my personal training clients I don't think I ever charged them for

302
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
And then at one point

303
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
Kind of one of those beautiful organic things

304
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Where

305
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
I was doing a lot of

306
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Young model

307
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
I was their personal trainer

308
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,439
And there's an agency that used to send me all of the young models who were a little bit out of shape

309
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
To get them in shape

310
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
I'm at agency had

311
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
A couple of girls who were the boogers

312
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
And one of them had

313
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Quite Baskin and started to come for facial

314
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
And then she started to send me all of the young models

315
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,311
Who had bad skin and I started to really

316
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Gained a reputation for being able to

317
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
The clear up ads

318
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,015
At which point I got other people coming in who were not necessarily just

319
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
You know

320
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
Young new models but in fact

321
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
I'm more well-known individuals who happen to

322
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,999
Live downtown here about me through the grapevine and you know

323
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
Started coming in and paying for that service

324
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
Where where are you doing this at this point

325
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,751
What started at my apartment and then I rented a tiny little space probably

326
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
NSA

327
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
300 square feet

328
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
It was just a one-room Studio I had little closet where people could change

329
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
And a chair where they could wait

330
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
That was what I had in people to come in for their facials

331
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
So you would probably you were

332
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Mira const

333
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Currently working but it sounds like you were

334
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
When you were doing pretty well and you had money as a

335
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Coming in Premiere Pro

336
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Personal training good money it coming in

337
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
From the facials like that

338
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Expenses but you

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Like you were covering

340
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
Oh yeah I was covering my expenses I was at a very low maintenance person knows I lived in in the East Village in my

341
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Studio arts

342
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Isn't that sort of a

343
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Kind of call it a one bedroom

344
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
And I had a futon

345
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
For a sofa

346
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
I had a

347
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
Tiny TV that one of my personal training clients have given me because they didn't want it anymore

348
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
It's sat on a crate

349
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
I had a

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Vacuum cleaner

351
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
And you know it's a lamp in a radio.

352
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
So you know I was

353
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
I was

354
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
A minimalist

355
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
What's a client so mostly models at SFO

356
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Yeah it was quite funny because

357
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
Only have one door right over the door

358
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
And people just sent us at the door knock and then I would open the door and

359
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
I remember from time to time opening the door

360
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
And the person standing there was so

361
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
Outstandingly beautiful male or female that I wouldn't be able to

362
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Speak

363
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Gasp and lose my breath and then I have to kind of

364
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,071
You know get my composure back and welcome them in and show them where to change and then

365
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Give him a facial butt

366
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
That was when it really

367
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Exploded and everybody started

368
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Come in from

369
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Uma Thurman I didn't

370
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Kidman Demi Moore

371
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
Annie Leibovitz came in

372
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
How did you get all these Super Famous clients like

373
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
What was your

374
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
If I tell you I

375
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
I'm just really thorough

376
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,255
I think it's really important to be thorough and do you know

377
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Do the best job you could doubt

378
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Listen most facials

379
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Would take an hour

380
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Right.

381
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Facial is generally an hour

382
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
I might be in there for two hours

383
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
With somebody if they really needed it for me time you know

384
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
If I have the time and I could

385
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Could have somebody

386
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
Have there treatment for longer I would do it and I Bank

387
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
You get results when you put time in

388
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
So at what point did you think you know

389
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
This really could be

390
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
A business like I need to

391
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
Think about turning this into just something Beyond

392
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
This 300 square foot

393
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
In a little suit

394
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Walk-in closet

395
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
2 something

396
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
I think I've

397
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Realize that it could be

398
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Viable

399
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
I guess career

400
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
When my appointment book

401
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
Started to be

402
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
People first

403
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
5 to 6

404
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Thanks in advance

405
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
People would call and I couldn't necessarily get them in at the time that they requested I was working today

406
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
6 days a week

407
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
And still still trying to hang on to some of my earlier personal training clients

408
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
And realizing that it was just

409
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
So hard to be able to do both that I might have to

410
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
You know someday give that up

411
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
Also realize that I could train other people to do

412
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
The same thing

413
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
And that wasn't something that ever

414
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Entered my mind before because

415
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,031
Cuz obviously you know when you think that you're

416
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Early passes

417
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
You're going to go to university in your going to have a profession you're going to work

418
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
Professional never again no one in my family had ever

419
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
Have their own business or

420
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Give me that example

421
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
You can run a business that you can employ people that you can

422
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Grow an idea

423
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
So

424
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
I think probably after two years in that

425
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
That tiny little

426
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
300

427
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Square foot space I hired someone

428
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
I'm who came in and started to learn how I was doing treatments

429
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
And then I found a bigger

430
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Space that I could rent

431
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Which was just

432
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Two blocks away

433
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
And started to build out what was

434
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Ben called let's face it

435
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
So when

436
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
How did you become Bliss how did that

437
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Adeline name be

438
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Become the name

439
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Your company

440
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
So at let's face it

441
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
It started to become so busy that we were booked and they were

442
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
At that point probably 5S

443
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Estheticians

444
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,071
Esthetician being a person who gives facials and we worked on different shifts

445
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,167
So somewhere part-time but we tried to make the most of the 12th

446
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,543
14 hours that we could be open in our building during during each day and we were also open on Saturday

447
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
And at one point

448
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Probably after about

449
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
2 years

450
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
We were so busy that when people would call they wouldn't be able to get an appointment for

451
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Anywhere between

452
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
You know 14

453
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
16 months

454
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
And supply

455
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Yeah you know it was so amazing because people come in they would have their treatment they would leave it would be so hot

456
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
Happy and they would book

457
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
For that same time slot

458
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
For the next

459
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
12 or 18 months

460
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
I've never actually

461
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
Great story

462
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
Will you turn up the huge snowstorm of

463
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
In 1990

464
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
I-95 in New York where

465
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
Width of a snow piled up for 12 feet on the side of the road then

466
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Yes okay

467
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
Every everything around us with closing

468
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
Crate Barrel close Dean & DeLuca close

469
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Everybody clothes

470
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Are phone that day

471
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Was ringing off the hook

472
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
What people say

473
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Has anyone cancelled

474
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
Can we get in

475
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Because

476
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
They were hoping that a point would become available and it's somebody else would have cancelled their put and nobody cancel their appointments

477
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Somehow

478
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,663
Despite the weather everybody still made it down there cuz gossip are they going to cancel their appointment

479
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
So it was amazing

480
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
So I guess it was like

481
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,111
Like 1996 when when you open an even larger

482
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
Storefront right in this is when you called it

483
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Let's write

484
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Yep

485
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
And it was

486
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Much

487
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Bigger

488
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Area floorplate then we'd had at let's face it

489
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,983
We had 10 treatment rooms that we had a nap room

490
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
I'm and we opened in

491
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
The beginning of July of 1996

492
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,711
How did you have the money to do this I mean the Mustang you must have

493
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Rent a space you have to

494
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,855
Play Take a 3-year lease you had to put lots of money down yet.

495
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Convert the space I mean

496
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Did you bring in outside investment

497
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
At the time

498
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
I was pretty scary

499
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
And I again peanut having not had the experience of anyone or you know really any

500
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
Business school experience I didn't really

501
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
Consider I didn't even think about outside in

502
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
What I knew was

503
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
That

504
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
If I gave facials myself

505
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
All day long everyday

506
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
And I can probably take Sunday off

507
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
And charged you know maybe it was 80

508
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
For a facial then

509
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Then I could still pay that rent

510
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
By myself and I

511
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
How is a calculation that I made

512
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,024
I'm intensive of the build out of the spa

513
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,168
I took a little bit of a flyer on that one because at that time of course we were booked for

514
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
18 months in advance and I kind of did the calculation in terms of

515
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
What

516
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
You know

517
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
What we made

518
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
When we were full all day long

519
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Everyday

520
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
That we were really lucky

521
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
The timing was great on this

522
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
About two months

523
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,344
Before we open bless and while we were still in the construction phases

524
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
American folk

525
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
Did a beautiful piece

526
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
With a beautiful Irving Penn portraits

527
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,584
A girl having milk poured over her head and talked about

528
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Sweet cream

529
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,680
And one of them was a

530
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
I think one of them is creme de la mer

531
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,824
Which Pita Estee Lauder went on to buy and turned it into a big thing

532
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,944
And one of them was a Swiss oxygen cream that we saw and

533
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
When is

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Article drop

535
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Thousands

536
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
A people started to call to buy this with

537
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Oxygen cream

538
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
And

539
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
It

540
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Latin probably for four or five months

541
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Buena Vista

542
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,632
Article having such an incredible effect on the sales of products

543
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Out of our

544
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
The facial place

545
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
A lot of the construction

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
Cost for almost covered by that 1 hour

547
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Incredible

548
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,200
You think about like renting a space in New York City today

549
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
In Manhattan

550
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Insane like you have to be

551
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Multi-millionaire

Attentive

554
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Applications in end

555
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
And you did this in 1996 which

556
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:03,424
Still kind of do that and not be a millionaire I think so I think it was probably one of the last

557
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,288
Periods of time that you could do that not be a millionaire they seem to be a little bit more

558
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Rust in terms of hair

559
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
You know here's the kid I remember the landlord

560
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
Kind of looking at me thinking with his kid and she's obviously

561
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
Responsible and she's got this

562
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
Decent business already and you know let's give it a shot

563
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
Certainly I flinched

564
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
And it was terrifying filling out the paperwork

565
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
And it was

566
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
You're looking at it thinking of the responsibilities of that overhead

567
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
But for me

568
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Cuz I never had anything

569
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
To lose everything

570
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Was not a big deal

571
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,776
So here's what I'm

572
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
I'm trying to figure out they were at their worst

573
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Spas

574
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
They're still there

575
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
But you come in and you

576
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
You have this

577
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Baseball

578
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Call it that

579
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Somehow

580
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Was just

581
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Exploded

582
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
And I mean every articles and people are lining up in the key appointment

583
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
What was it about

584
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
That's what were you offering

585
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
That was different

586
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
From those other place

587
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
You know I've always

588
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
An instance then all the businesses that have started have been

589
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Places I want to go

590
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
So I wanted to go

591
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
To get a facial or get a body treatment to get a pedicure in a non-judgmental place where people were having fun with them

592
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Music was not about whales

593
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Singing or

594
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
I hated that kind of music I loved

595
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
Your Jazz and really good sofa music so he's a mix of music myself

596
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,560
I wanted it to be different I wanted to be a place that I would like to go that I would feel comfortable

597
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Where people will be at

598
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Accepting of me

599
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
You no answer that's what we did for everybody else

600
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
And

601
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
I think

602
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
It was

603
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
Fantastic because it was

604
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Very egalitarian

605
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:51,712
You would have those Superstars and their soap Madonna and whoever but then you would also have

606
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,832
Secretaries who had kids from NYU let you know terrible problems with their skin

607
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Just wanted

608
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Relief from it neighbor

609
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,464
Are going to school at the Block so it was easy for them to come to us

610
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
Yep really everybody and it was

611
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
It was

612
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
Wonderful because everyone

613
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
Was treated exactly the same way

614
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
I think I'd be nervous getting Madonna facial

615
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
She was very curious

616
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
She's one of those people with tons and tons of questions

617
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,360
What are you doing now what is this what is that supposed to do

618
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
But you don't screenshot with it really nervous

619
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Giving anybody a facial

620
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
So much fun

621
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
There was so many characters

622
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
From the people who work at the front desk

623
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
The client

624
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
New New York

625
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Bulova Mason character

626
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
It is like watching a television show

627
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
It didn't seem like work

628
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
In just a moment

629
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Call Marcia sold Bliss

630
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544

632
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
And then another

633
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Then another

634
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

672
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Gyros

673
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
So it's 1996 let's face it

674
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Becomes Bliss and it opens as a day spa in New York Soho neighborhood and almost instantly

675
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
The phones are ringing off the hook

676
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
So in a very short. Of time Marcia decides to expand double the size of bliss

677
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,832
Chelsea gets married around this time to her boyfriend Terry

678
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
And he joins the business and the two of them decide to try new things like make a line of skin care products under

679
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Under the name Bliss

680
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
And soon

681
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,864
They start talking about expanding to other cities

682
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,216
But just as things start to take off this is 3 years in the business

683
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,288
A huge multinational brand comes knocking

684
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Lvmh

685
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,152
The conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton and they want a piece of bliss

686
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
70% and they're offering Marcia

687
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
A lot of money

688
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,600
So the amount of money that's been reported

689
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
It was anywhere from

690
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
30 to 50 million dollars for that

691
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
That's 70% stake it which is a lot

692
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,840
But you guys were just hitting your stride so

693
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
Why did you sell it at

694
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,544
Pumpkin oat for about a year prior to 1999 if we actually had a lot it was a

695
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,616
Hot time for beauty companies

696
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,688
Retrospectively there were a lot of

697
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
Cool new companies starting and a lot of interest in those companies from the big Beauty conglomerates they were starting

698
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,672
To buy up smaller players rather than you trying to build their own

699
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
And of course both had such a reputation

700
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,840
That we we had more than one large large company come and try and get us

701
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
And I think the most exciting thing for me at that time was the idea of not having

702
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,312
All of the financial responsibility

703
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
For that business

704
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:09,248
I'm on my head we actually were we had expanded and Along Comes A large company

705
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
Start looking at books

706
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Which was

707
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Was also very funny because they had a

708
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
Account and I think based in Chicago who couldn't believe

709
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
But we were making this money without doing something illegal

710
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,840
They came in and made it a report and there were all these things in the report like

711
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
You know Bliss purports to have celebrity clients

712
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Play reports to be doing facials in the what do you think we're doing in here

713
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,432
It was really it was quite funny to read I guess they just never seen anything like it before

714
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
But

715
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
It just

716
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
It seems like after so many years of

717
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Being

718
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Kind of flat broke

719
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Or

720
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
You know on the edge

721
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
They would be nice just to have a little bit of money

722
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
In the bank

723
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
It is getting

724
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Obviously Bliss

725
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
Really well but you guys were

726
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Still living

727
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
Yeah I'll be okay so for anybody whose live their entire life worrying about money or you know just kind of

728
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
You're living very minimally

729
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
You do wonder if that's your motivation

730
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
And if your motivation and all this

731
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Skills that you've developed will

732
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Somehow profoundly changed when suddenly there are some zeros in your bank

733
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
So that was

734
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
The bit of Christ

735
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
This thinking will I be

736
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Different if I'm not

737
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Starving

738
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
But

739
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
It was just too good an offer

740
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
To refuse

741
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
They had flown me to Paris on the Concord

742
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:37,568
I had gone to pick Christian Dior Boutique they took me to Orleans weather Factory was where

743
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
They were you know manufacturing math

744
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Skara and

745
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,504
I'll be there when you come back to me or actually I have to say I came back to New York

746
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
I flew back on the Concorde and I'm on the subway

747
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
America

748
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
In a Coca-Cola spilled all over the

749
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Feed the garbage strewn everywhere and

750
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
Hanging on that subway car thinking Kind of Wonderful is the only person on the Concord this morning but then the subway

751
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,704
And it was just it was it was funny cuz I can happily do both

752
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:09,056
But you did realize that maybe after having worked my tail off

753
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,944
For 14 to 16 hours a day for the last however many years at that point I guess it would have been 11 years

754
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,784
Maybe it didn't have to be that hard anymore

755
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,160
Did it change your life like suddenly coming at all this money

756
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
You know I think

757
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
You get a few a few

758
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
Dollars in your bank account and I did have a laugh and we used to joke when it got wired you know we said the eagle has landed

759
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,496
Okay we laughed and then we went and got groceries in our regular shopping Brooklyn

760
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,568
Don't see money to you it just goes into

761
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
It's numbers on a

762
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,944
On a piece of paper and it lands and then yeah baby

763
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
You might

764
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
Fly business class

765
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
A maybe you might

766
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,904
Go and buy a few more clothes than you normally would maybe once

767
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
And then you realize

768
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
You know what you love is what you love and

769
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
I think it takes quite a long time to start

770
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,632
Living differently when when you

771
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
Live for so long with the same attitude

772
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,800
Okay see you guys in 1999 you sold

773
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,360
About 70% of the company to

774
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
To lvmh

775
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
2014

776
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
You sold the rest

777
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Your shares to another come

778
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
You walking

779
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Tiredly away from Bliss

780
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
That's what was

781
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Who is going on in your life

782
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
Lvmh after 2001

783
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
They started to divest of most of it Beauty businesses

784
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
And we were one of the first ones

785
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
To get snapped up by another business

786
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
So Starwood Hotels and Resorts

787
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
Because they wanted to have blue spots

788
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,128
And it was put those into W hotels and another hotel

789
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
And so

790
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,784
Yeah that was also very flattering so first I had you know one of the largest luxury groups in the world by

791
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,416
My business and then I had the largest hotel group in the world by my business so you know to two Good Hits

792
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,744
But they put somebody in charge of the business

793
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
Who was the young guy probably The Prodigy of the

794
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
The man who owns Starwood at the time

795
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,704
Really didn't understand customer service the way I understood it

796
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
And

797
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
I felt like I was spending most of my day

798
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Trying to teach him but he was ready

799
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
And

800
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
For me

801
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Do you know

802
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Chip

803
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
Spend my time on

804
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,832
That when the person is not necessarily

805
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
Open Tuesday ideas

806
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,464
Just felt like banging my head of

807
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
It was very

808
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Is it raining

809
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
So I decided to take a

810
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
And I didn't really know what I was going to do

811
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
But I just didn't want to do that

812
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Anymore

813
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
So when when you left

814
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Starwood

815
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
What did you do to chew Dino

816
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Musa London

817
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Like for a while did you just

818
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
Can I hang out

819
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
Controller not working for a while

820
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
But probably had a

821
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
About three months

822
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
Off

823
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
And

824
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
As soon as I

825
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
I had

826
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,048
A little bit of energy back I started to

827
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
Come up with a few new ideas for a new brands and and new things that I has a woman again

828
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
The hole in the market

829
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Play Store

830
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
So I guess the

831
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
We should we should we should point out here that

832
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
It didn't take very long for

833
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
How to decide to start a new business

834
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Which it which was soapandglory

835
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,576
And this is going to be like before tubal personal hygiene products

836
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
Yeah I'll be okay so I remembered you

837
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
You know scanning newspaper says scanning these

838
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Journals

839
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
Every Sunday and

840
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,352
FEMA Zeitgeist really being one about collaboration

841
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
And you know Heist

842
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
Street prices all right you know

843
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
Really affordable pricing for designers

844
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Stop an H&M was Leading The Way with that

845
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
And also

846
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
About waist

847
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
There was starting to be a lot of

848
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
A lot of

849
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,576
Interest in environmental concerns there was a story about David Beckham

850
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Only wearing his underwear once

851
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Throwing it out and how wasteful it was you know that

852
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
SOA

853
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
I started to think

854
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
You know people are really

855
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Worried about the environment

856
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
People want more for them

857
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
And so how can I roll that all up and do

858
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Fun little brand

859
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
That I can sell

860
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,080
And soap and Glory it was designer affordable

861
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Cosmetic

862
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,944
And then of course I we also did Dre sample packaging that wouldn't be

863
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
You're too hard on the environment

864
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
Took all the Zeitgeist ideas

865
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Bundle them up and

866
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
So we launched at Harvey Nichols

867
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
Really fun department store and then

868
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Boots came knocking

869
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:51,680
Medusa's the big the big drug store

870
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Britain

871
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,032
And so we rolled out into boots and it was

872
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:01,152
It was actually very small for the first couple of years we didn't do that much business but within

873
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,968
I'd say 767 years we were

874
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
Probably be telling about a hundred million

875
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,392
And you didn't and you did not take any outside investment for this cup

876
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
I know cuz you didn't need to you had you could use the money that you had from the sale of blessed to

877
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,656
Do lunch this next company organic growth

878
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,752
People think about these overnight successes and very rarely are they in overnight

879
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:32,128
My things do take years and they grow but then once they grow big enough they start to snowball

880
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,968
And though it started to snowball in it at one point

881
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
I remember

882
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Istudent

883
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
Crazy Christmas bags

884
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
Is Chris inspectors stop

885
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Full of Prada

886
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
And they were literally

887
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
But hundreds of thousands of them produced

888
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Every Christmas and

889
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
The week before Christmas

890
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
That would be the special offer

891
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
We should go in and get

892
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
Soaking for a Christmas bag and if you walked around London

893
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Every third person was

894
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Carrying

895
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Three or four of these on their arms

896
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
It was such a big

897
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,152
In the midst of of launching soap & Glory

898
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
A year later

899
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
You lunch to another company

900
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
In addition to that you lunch today

901
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
A company that makes

902
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
I like flip-flops

903
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
FitFlop

904
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,280
So how did that happened why would you like a second company whilst

905
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Trying to a lunch

906
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,400
Second company why would you like to third company

907
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
But trying to get your second

908
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
You know

909
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
This is very interesting

910
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
White lights to kind of simultaneously

911
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,920
However I have just read this book called Originals

912
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,200
And this one chapter

913
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
In that book where it says

914
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,552
2 entrepreneurs always hedge their bets

915
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Right you don't give up your day job because

916
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,184
You think that you are you know side hustle or whatever it is

917
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Is going to actually pay off

918
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,840
You always do two things at the same time cuz one of them may not work and you want to make sure that you've got another one

919
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
And it's kind of like personal training

920
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
While I was doing facials

921
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
What's right and I guess I did that

922
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Again where

923
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,592
With soap and Glory when I started it you know it was only a year later

924
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,664
But I also launched FitFlop and it was really based on

925
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,784
The idea for one shoe which was economically correct which would align your body while you watch

926
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
Because of my personal training days and trying to

927
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
Use my time more efficiently and having started this

928
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,280
This new business open Glory thinking that I'd have work-life balance and then finding that I had

929
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,328
No time at all actually

930
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
Or very little time to exercise

931
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
I was thinking to myself

932
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,240
What can I invent to make more out of this time that I

933
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,544
That I have when I am walking

934
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
How can I make walking really work for me in an optimal way

935
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:47,040
So I've been spent a lot of time on different trains in the UK going to different universities trying to find somebody

936
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,624
Who would be able to help me realize this idea and in fact

937
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Eventually I found Doctor Dave Cook at the University

938
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
South Bank in London which was

939
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
Probably a mile away at the

940
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
So I eventually met with DACA

941
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
When I went in at security idea

942
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,032
Blah blah blah and he said I know how you can do that

943
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,616
So they told me they could make a prototype that they had a shoe design

944
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,712
Course going on within the University

945
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,064
I waited and waited waited about three months later I come in to see this prototype in it

946
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Literally it looks like a lump of coal

947
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
With some breaks

948
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Finance

949
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Sell vested so ugly

950
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
No one will wear this outside no matter what it does for them

951
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
But we tested it right so we

952
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
We put it on

953
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Some

954
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Different

955
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
University students feet and

956
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
Put electrodes on them and we looked at their

957
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Forces

958
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,336
You can see whether or not the technology is helping

959
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,384
To align

960
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,944
The force that goes through your heel

961
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Your heel strike

962
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
When you walk

963
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
And

964
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,856
It worked right said this this lump of coal with the robes

965
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
It worked

966
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
So

967
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
I've been thought okay

968
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
What do I do now

969
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
About the shoe

970
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
It does what I wanted to do

971
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,656
I don't know how to make a shoe or where to go to get shoes made and then I felt like

972
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
To go to Nike or Puma or whatever and they thought no I can't cuz it going to steal my idea

973
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,824
Yeah and then in the recesses of my mind

974
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,152
Right I remember that I knew somebody who did Footwear

975
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:21,248
At the time they were called Peter black they've since been bought by a Chinese conglomerate

976
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,344
We called Peter black Footwear and we met with somebody who did sourcing for them

977
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
And then we had a mold made

978
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,000
Which again you know which one of these since you got to take a flyer it was probably

979
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,304
$40,000 to have the mold made

980
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:39,424
So you have to really hope this is going to go because $40,000 is not nothing

981
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
But at the time

982
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:46,848
I thought you know what I buy this shoe with the shoe was available so I'm sure other people will buy this shoe

983
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
And so would you run up we made a prototype

984
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
Ratably comfortable

985
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
Incredible

986
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
And

987
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,368
I remember sitting down so course I went to retailers that I knew

988
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
From my American days first and then and then also to Busan in the UK who is selling soap & Glory but about

989
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
A year before that I had met with Bath & Body Works

990
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Explain the idea

991
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
And the buyer from Bath and Body Works

992
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Looked at me and said

993
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,544
I'll take summer between 300000 and 500000 pairs of those in a year

994
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Wow

995
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
I was shocked I remember walking away cuz they wanted to meet at claridge's so we went to claridge's you know and had tea and talked about it then

996
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
Walking out of claridge's tanking

997
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Whole new level

998
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,952
I mean I couldn't get 300,000

999
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Facials a year

1000
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,096
It's incredible I mean if you if you think about it right so you

1001
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
You sell blessed

1002
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
You walk away from blessing

1003
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
You then

1004
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
Launch soap & Glory in

1005
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Run that business

1006
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Simultaneously launch

1007
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
The economic shoe line

1008
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
FitFlop in 2007

1009
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
You sold soap & Glory To Boots

1010
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
So I guess in

1011
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
2014

1012
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
And then last year you launched

1013
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
A brand new business

1014
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,975
A subscription service

1015
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
For high-end cosmetics

1016
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
That are actually

1017
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Very little money

1018
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Adpi

1019
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
How do you do that how do you

1020
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
How do you

1021
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,799
Create so many how do you say on top of so many different ideas and Company

1022
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,151
You know guy today I don't feel like I'm quite so on top of it

1023
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
But beauty pie the whole idea behind it was

1024
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
Knowing

1025
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Peanut in the Cosmetics industry

1026
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
Fun it is

1027
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
To go to some of these third-party lab

1028
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
And that you walk out of there with

1029
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,743
Peanut bags

1030
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
For a free cosmetic

1031
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
And

1032
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Yeah you're you're walking

1033
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,959
Through of cosmetic store with a bag that you just got from the third party lab.

1034
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
It's probably

1035
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
Got a $2,000 street value

1036
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
And they were all free and thinking

1037
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Wow

1038
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,663
You know what if I can bring every woman into the

1039
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
Into the luxury cosmetic Factory with me and we can raid it together

1040
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
Have fun with that babe

1041
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
What a thrill is like being a kid in the candy store

1042
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,183
And so that was the idea behind PewDiePie how do I

1043
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,791
How do I give women the same feeling that I have to get the

1044
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Furnace parts

1045
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Of being able to work in cosmetics is Wendy's

1046
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Reebok

1047
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
Stuff from the lab show up

1048
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
And Pewdiepie is a little bit different if buy stuff at the factory

1049
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Drake Hospital

1050
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Is practically

1051
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
Compared to what you pay for it at retail

1052
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,711
What what's interesting is that you don't seem to be

1053
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,783
Service sentimentally attached to your comfort

1054
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
You lost them you create them you

1055
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Tournament

1056
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
Incredibly successful companies

1057
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
And and you sold at least

1058
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Two of them and

1059
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
And you may

1060
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
Sell others

1061
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Do you

1062
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,143
Is there a certain point where you just say yeah I don't know

1063
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,215
I just want to move on and in and start something new like is it

1064
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Is it almost like

1065
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
When a business becomes

1066
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
To bake or

1067
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,127
Hey or are you just going to get bored of you

1068
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
You want to

1069
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Start something new

1070
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
You know I thought about this one a lot

1071
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
I did get asked you and why

1072
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,111
Why do you keep doing this

1073
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
And I'm and I think about the

1074
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,791
Thrill that is beauty pie right now which is really like I'm rubbing sticks together

1075
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
And I think it's

1076
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
What really drives me and what I really love

1077
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
Have you ever heard the expression

1078
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,519
Your first marriage is for love the second One for money and the third one

1079
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
Companionship

1080
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
I think some famous divorce

1081
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
Say probably

1082
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
They said that one

1083
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
The companionship that

1084
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
That

1085
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
I get out of having a business where I can really

1086
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,367
Interface with women and I'm making them happy

1087
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
Answer Man of course we have

1088
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,767
We have 4% men at the moment but do you want to make people feel that happy and

1089
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,839
And have them communicate that to me is what

1090
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Give me the

1091
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
Biggest Buzz I mean it's

1092
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
It's

1093
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
What do you think

1094
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
That

1095
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
That your your brain works that way that

1096
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
That you just

1097
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
R generating all these

1098
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Hainan and ideas that

1099
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
That don't just going to

1100
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Flowed up in

1101
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
In the space that ideas

1102
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
You actually

1103
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Stop sit down and start

1104
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Really

1105
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
They almost seem too obsessed

1106
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
DC Legends

1107
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
/ take everything

1108
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
In your world like

1109
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Why do you think

1110
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
That happened

1111
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
How did I end up like this

1112
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
It was sort of yeah

1113
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
You know I have

1114
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,079
But a lot about that cuz you have to psychoanalyze yourself and I

1115
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
I also tell wannabe entrepreneurs right

1116
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
I would tell them that

1117
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,015
One of the tools that they should have is understanding of how the human brain works

1118
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Text right because if you can understand how your brain is fooling you

1119
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
When you might be reacting

1120
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
To something rather than making a sound

1121
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,815
Decision or when you might be feeling insecure when you really shouldn't be a when you're jumping to a judgment

1122
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,911
Nest doesn't have enough information to back it up

1123
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,287
Now when you try to think those psychoanalyze yourself I would say well I must be extremely

1124
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
Competitive because I will come up with these ideas and things

1125
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
I can't do that and then I'll think

1126
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
I have to do that and then I'll take

1127
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,551
But if I don't do that fast somebody else is going to do it

1128
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,599
And I don't know why I care

1129
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
I need why do I care if somebody else goes and does it

1130
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,511
There must be some competitive aspect to it and so I much

1131
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
More comfortable

1132
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
Where I feel like I'm building something

1133
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,655
It's got to be genetic

1134
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
Right cuz there's nothing else that would

1135
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Really

1136
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Blamed

1137
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
How much of

1138
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Of your

1139
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Just teasing

1140
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Is because of

1141
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
Of your intelligence

1142
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
Hard-working how much how much do you think

1143
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Is because

1144
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Good luck

1145
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Okay

1146
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Okay

1147
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
I'd say

1148
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,671
I'm certainly above-average

1149
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
And intelligent

1150
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
I'm not a genius

1151
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
I know a lot of people

1152
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
People who are

1153
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,863
Much more intellectual than I am actually much moisture

1154
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
TJ

1155
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
And

1156
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
People always say that I'm very stressed

1157
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
Teejet but I don't think of myself as such a strategic

1158
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Sick person Digest

1159
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,359
Tend to think of things in very

1160
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Simple

1161
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Terms

1162
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Luck I've certainly had some

1163
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
I mean

1164
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
Moving to New York and having a sister who was

1165
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,855
Really good looking at in a field where she could

1166
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,183
Give people who could afford my services

1167
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
You know if they

1168
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,047
An introduction to me so that I can have clientele

1169
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
And then more of those people

1170
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,167
I would prefer more of those people that's certainly lucky

1171
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,263
However if I wasn't good at what I was doing I don't think I would have any up

1172
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
And if I didn't show up on time if I was

1173
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
Pet friendly and

1174
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
In a reliable I suppose

1175
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
You get a bit of luck

1176
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
I don't have to make something out of it

1177
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
And

1178
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
I find

1179
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,391
When I see and I'm sure you see this is why you see people were so talented

1180
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Really genius at what they do but they're not

1181
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
Ever really

1182
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
Successful they're always struggling

1183
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
And I always wonder

1184
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,191
You know is it just a choice that you make where at one point you say you know what I am

1185
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
I am worthy

1186
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
I deserve this why not me

1187
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Because

1188
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
You know why not you

1189
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,967
And if you're willing to work that hard why shouldn't you then take the success that comes with it

1190
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,807
And I think that's a very complex thing for many people

1191
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
And somehow I've managed to

1192
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Over

1193
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Combat

1194
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:34,303
It is amazing how many how many of these companies

1195
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Created

1196
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
E-end

1197
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
All the things you've done

1198
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,959
Have you ever come up with the idea that that you thought was just going to

1199
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
Amazingly well that you just

1200
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,823
Didn't pursue because it wasn't actually quite right

1201
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,871
I have one right now but I

1202
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
Not that I'm not pursuing it

1203
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
Not right

1204
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
But I can't say what it is because we're patenting at the moment you are going to lunch something new

1205
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
On top of all these other

1206
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,439
Incredible a guy to you

1207
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:05,791
Doesn't your brain want to explode

1208
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,191
Marcia Kilgore is the founder of bliss Spas soap

PewDiePie makeup and also a v brand we just ran out of time to talk about it

1212
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,247
It's a line of environmentally friendly bath products called the super duper

1213
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:30,111
Mercy has built so many companies that on the last episode of the Oprah Winfrey show

1214
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
Oprah named her one of her

1215
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Personal inspiration

The first of quick thanks to one of our sponsors

1219

Starbucks

1220
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
For the first time

1221
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
43 years

1222
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Starbucks

1223
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,103
Introducing a second espresso

1224
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Starbucks

1225
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
Blonde espresso

1226
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
It's smooth and supple

1227
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
So whatever your drink is

1228
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
Try it with Starbucks

1229
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Blond espresso

1230
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
Hey thanks for sticking around

1231
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:09,535
Tylenol for how you built that and the business were about to talk about goes

1232
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Back about

1233
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
25 years

1234
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,911
Before we all had cell phones and back then

1235
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
The most

1236
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
Portent handheld device

1237
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
In our lives

1238
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
Was probably

1239
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
TV remote

1240
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
I mean

1241
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,199
TV a week and it's a device that we

1242
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
Use everyday

1243
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,063
This is Steve Crowell of Chicago

1244
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
Steve worked at a big box

1245
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
Electronic store

1246
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,463
He discovered the many many ways that the

1247
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
TV remote

1248
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Qingdao

1249
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
The baby

1250
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Takes the remote and starts to

1251
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Banging

1252
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
Destroys at the dog bite

1253
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Fix the remote

1254
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
Control and a half

1255
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,495
Text the

1256
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,639
Numbers have the remote control really angry bird

1257
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
I am surprised myself

1258
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
About why people are missing

1259
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,783
So many remotes

1260
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
How to file this information away

1261
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
In his head

1262
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,439
And in 1992 when the electronics store where he worked

1263
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Went out of business

1264
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,815
He and the other employees get a discount on the leftover merchandise

1265
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
And while I was buying some of the

1266
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
The used electronics one of the store managers

1267
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,239
Big box of remote controls

1268
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
And I asked my how much

1269
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Are those

1270
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
I'll just give him

1271
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,711
And Steve already figured that with lots of people probably have broken and

1272
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,527
Smash remotes lying around

1273
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
Take this box of

1274
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Perfectly usable remote

1275
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
He'll sell them for a few bucks

1276
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,463
A month later I started selling these at

1277
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
Flea market and they were just

1278
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Flying off the

1279
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Michelle Phan

1280
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Like what

1281
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
You know there wasn't a man

1282
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,959
Not only were there a surprising number of people who needed remote

1283
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,519
Steve found out there were actually boxes of

1284
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Orphan remotes

1285
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
Floating around in the marketplace because

1286
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
The TV companies usually made extras

1287
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
To all he had

1288
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
Do was become a middleman

1289
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,831
And fortunately this coincided with the internet Revolution

1290
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
The internet was

1291
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
Push-up it wasn't for the

1292
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
Internet I wouldn't be in this fix

1293
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Cuz I remember to this day I

1294
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,815
Started selling on eBay March 3rd of 98

1295
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
So you might be thinking yeah I get this year

1296
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
He's no family with you know a crazy pet bird might need to replace the remote but he is this thing scale

1297
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,127
Could Steve actually make money selling these things

1298
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
In the answer

1299
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Productivity yes because he

1300
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,759
He figured out how to sell wholesale like

1301
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,343
He could sell a bunch of remotes to a budget hotel

1302
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Solder

1303
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,439
TVs are quite old let's say from the mid-90s

1304
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,719
Please I've got to update some

1305
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,535
And they're trying to cut their cost

1306
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,839
So they may buy a bunch of

1307
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
TVs

1308
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
From a refurbisher and they met

1309
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
Knock it the remote controls

1310
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,519
So then they contact me

1311
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
So after years of doing this

1312
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
Steve now knows how to source

1313
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127

He charges anywhere from $0.50 to maybe twelve bucks a piece

1317
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,367
