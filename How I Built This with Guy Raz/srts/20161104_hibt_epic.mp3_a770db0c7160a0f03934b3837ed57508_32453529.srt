Probably would have been better if I just kept my own company and not

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
I'm going to work for anyone because all of a sudden I had a lot of money and not a lot of friends and I was in

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
Immediately attacked by the media and the industry and I felt the cold shoulder from ever

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
Everyone and I said oh my god I've made a massive mistake here

Powerful executive

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
In music

25
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
Built his own record label

26
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
And then he went on to manage several others but

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
What is really known for is

28
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Finding amazing

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664

Any others

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Everything about him is

34
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,768
He just seems to have this sense of what pop music fans want to hear

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
In that sense it really began when La was

36
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
Did the kid growing up in Cincinnati in the 1960

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
Listening to a lot of music

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Just hearing music on the radio

39
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Buying 45

40
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
Buying James Brown's records

41
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
Old Motown records to buy old soul records

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
And bringing them home

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
And just drumming on the table along with the songs

44
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
By the way I thought I was going to be the next James Brown

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Didn't work out

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,560
So the truth is that I failed miserably like a

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,216
Oh yeah all the time fake Mike's of the broom you make the mirrors

48
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
You know we did everything you know we had a great time growing up and music was everywhere

49
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
So how did you get into into play NAB and how did that happen

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
Funny Story I played at home by myself forever

51
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
And never play with the band

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
And then one day I'm in my

53
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Basement and

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,144
I look out the window while I'm in the basement playing by myself

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
And there's a guy staring at

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
And it startled me

57
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,384
So I stopped and I went outside and I said hi and he had friendly eyes so you know the fear kind of went away

58
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
And he said

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
You play pretty good there's a band around the corner that needs a drummer

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
You know his name was Vince and Vince took me around the corner to meet

61
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
A couple of other musicians of bass player and guitar player

62
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,720
And you know I joined their van it was really that simple

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
And one band Led to another and

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
I think things started

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
How to get pretty serious by the time I was in high school

66
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,984
So I read that this is around a time or where you met somebody who would become this

67
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Transformational figure in your life

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
His name is Kenny Babyface Edmonds

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
One night Kenny came to watch my band play

70
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
And

71
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
About six months later I got a call from him asking me could he join my band

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Acid

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
And I don't think you fit

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
And then I met him a little while later in the studio

75
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
Man in the session

76
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Kenny Edmonds was writing a song and performing it

77
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
And I walked in while he was

78
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Recording

79
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
And when it came out of the booth

80
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
I was like oh my God that's Skaneateles

81
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
What's the guy that called me and said he wanted to join my band and ice

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
I said no

83
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
How stupid am I

84
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Because he's pretty incredible

85
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
So what you doing

86
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
I instantly befriended him

87
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
You did join our band we started to write songs together

88
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
And I made our demos that eventually got us

89
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Recording

90
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
And the name of the band was

91
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
The

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Deal deal

93
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
And you guys like

94
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Started to

95
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
Yeah we we had

96
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Some notoriety for sure

97
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Our first record

98
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
Was a song that I co-wrote called body talk and

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
It became a top-5 song

100
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
On R&B radio

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
That was good enough to get us on tour with

102
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,599
The great Luther Vandross who allowed us to open for him

103
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,999
So pretty much

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Overnight life change and all of a sudden we are

105
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,679
On a massive stage in an arena with 15 20000 people for night

106
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
But the most fascinating thing was

107
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
The talent that was around

108
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Watching Luther Vandross every night

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
And watching the musicians in the background singers

110
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
And the entire Productions that went into the shows

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
And I think I became more

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
Fascinated by the talent that we were around

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Then I was about actually being

114
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
A performer on stage

115
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
I think those probably the beginning

116
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Miso adrift

117
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Into

118
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
A talent finder in a talent nurturer

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
More so than I

120
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Performer

121
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
So how does you

122
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
And Babyface

123
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Disco from

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Being a band

125
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,159
To say hey you know what let's get out of this business

126
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
We were signed to a label in

127
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Los Angeles called solar records

128
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
And

129
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
The label was

130
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Like Junior Motown

131
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
The head of the company dick Griffey

132
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Call

133
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,287
After hearing some demo that Kenny and I did and asked us to

134
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Come out and produce other artists on the label

135
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,943
Before long we started getting calls from all the record labels in town

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
And back then you have to write the song ever

137
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
So we did it all

138
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
How many how many number one hits

139
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Did you guys write

140
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
We had probably

141
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
35

142
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
What

143
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
How did you guys know what

144
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
What it was

145
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Hey

146
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,599
It just takes great talent and Kenny Edmonds my partner is one of the most prolific songwriter

147
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Ever

148
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,231
But he had this great talent and I had the greatest job in the world I would hear the songs first

149
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
And decide which ones were

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
The good one

151
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
See what you would you say oh that's going to be

152
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Perfect for Whitney Houston exactly

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
This song is great but

154
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,287
The bridge not quite sure or that lyric I'm not sure if that lyric is it

155
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Or

156
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
It sounds great doesn't as a slow song

157
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Let's make it faster see how it sounds

158
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Maybe you should take it from that artist

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Give it to another artist

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
That was my thing was

161
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
To try to find the absolute perfect

162
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Pairing

163
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
I-40

164
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Material

165
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
UCCU in Babyface are

166
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Training at these hits

167
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
And at some point

168
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
What happened

169
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
What does he say to you or do you said in hey you know we

170
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
We should stop working for other people we should like

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Bill orender white why are we allowing

172
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
Our music to be picked over

173
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
Or people to make decisions about which songs will be singles

174
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
You know we actually know we're very close to it

175
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
We should do it ourselves

176
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,087
We lived in Los Angeles by then we loaded about trucks when we move to Atlanta Georgia why why Atlanta

177
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
We didn't have a reason

178
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
We really didn't

179
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
We decided Atlanta

180
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
By looking at a map

181
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Insane

182
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
How about Atlanta

183
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
And we did it move to Atlanta put a flag in the ground we open

184
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Turn it up a little office and called it laface records and we held auditions we would go on the radio and

185
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
Say Okay auditions are being held at the club Roxy yard or the Atlanta Knights or any of the night clubs and we will

186
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,551
Just hold auditions looking for talent

187
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
And before long the talent just came running

188
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Because we were the only shop in town and it's nobody's you wonder why

189
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
People think of things like that and I did it and I did

190
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Wildly successfully and I still don't know why we did it

191
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
How are you funding the business

192
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
We will work for hire so we will get paid

193
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
And we use that money to build a recording studio in Atlanta

194
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,135
As a record label we were funded by Eros the records

195
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Which way is

196
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
The great Clive Davis

197
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
So they had look up with joint ownership

198
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
Yes we had a joint venture we brought the talent they brought the money

199
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
We made creative

200
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Decisions in

201
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
We would bring it to them

202
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
For marketing and promotion

203
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
So

204
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
How did you learn how to run a company

205
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Up until that point you were

206
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Jamie was a two of you and you weren't here

207
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
You said you were a writer but like at this point you are

208
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Your CEO

209
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Yeah

210
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,111
It is I didn't know how to run a company but what I did know

211
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
What's how to manage

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
How did how did you know that

213
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Because I was a band leader for so many years

214
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
Yeah and you know there's not very much difference

215
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
Between being a bandleader and being a

216
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
CEO of

217
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Because it's managing tala

218
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,823
I won't say that I mastered it but I certainly do something about it

219
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
When I started

220
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
The company

221
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
And I figure the rest out

222
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
People who are summer

223
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
The biggest pains

224
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
In the world

225
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
Riley China goes there weren't bigger pains in the ass than the kids I went to high school

226
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
I mean

227
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
Imagine this I was at a very young age trying to manage people that were

228
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Drug addicts

229
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
Are people who weren't particularly motivated

230
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
But maybe they had great talent

231
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
Or people who

232
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Wer

233
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Just difficult for the sake of difficult

234
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
And I did manage to get these people out of their houses

235
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
And onto a stage

236
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
So for me was always people management

237
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
It was never completely company manager

238
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
Tomatoes always people man

239
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
And I take it one meeting at a time

240
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
And one person at a time

241
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
How did st stephen the First

242
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Like at the beginning

243
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
The first two years

244
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
That we had to label

245
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
Sharp learning curve

246
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
Who started the label in 1989

247
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Our first signing

248
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
Was a band called Damian Dame

249
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
And we gave them our best material

250
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
And it didn't work

251
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Like it's just nobody was stitches fell flat black people weren't buying the records we just thought you know we thought hours to record to fail this

252
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
Because we we thought we were perfect like

253
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
You know we could all these hits we have

254
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,511
So can't be the music it must be the production or the promotion I'm sorry

255
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
And Clive Davis said to me

256
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Or maybe it's the talent

257
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Yes they were

258
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Berrytown

259
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
The people but they would not

260
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
World class super

261
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Start

262
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Level Talent

263
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
They weren't

264
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Lake Whitney

265
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
So we learned pretty quickly that we needed

266
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
YouTube time better Talent

267
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Did you feel like a failure after I mean cuz

268
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
You can put all of your

269
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Effort into this

270
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
This is your first

271
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
Big test and you guys are sort of this

272
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
You know the successful Duo and then

273
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
Best thing to spike falls apart pretty quickly after you

274
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Silent mode will you feeling like maybe this is not going to work

275
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
Maybe we're going to go out that it would work but I did

276
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
Have to think about a different strategy

277
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
So my strategy was

278
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
Wait a minute this isn't working let me think

279
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
What are we doing wrong

280
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
I said I know what

281
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
We should get a soundtrack

282
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
To a big movie

283
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
And we should put all of our artists

284
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
On it and we should put all of the talent

285
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
That we have relationships within the industry

286
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
We should ask them to be a part of it

287
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
I will use this as a launching pad for our label

288
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
And our new artists

289
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
So I dreamed up this idea Dennison. Now how do I put

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Give me the movie

291
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
Need a movie

292
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,991

We've been asking you for your stories about the

318
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
The things that

319
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
You are building soap

320
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
Please do stick around to the end of this episode to here

321
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
One of those stories

322
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
It's how I built this from NPR

323
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
Gyros so it's 1991 and laface Records just had a major failure with one of its first bath

324
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
But Ellerbe thinks they can recover they can pull out of this

325
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
If they do this

326
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,031
One thing is a produce a soundtrack for a major Hollywood film

327
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
But of course

328
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
To find that film

329
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
So

330
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
He picks up the phone

331
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
So-called friend of mine her name is Cassandra Mills

332
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Ship recently had a soundtrack

333
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
For a movie called New Jack City

334
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,671
I said Cassandra how do you find that movie how do you find the soundtrack

335
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Tell me walk me through it how does that work

336
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
And she told me she said okay you have to go to the movie producers and have to go to the studios and just see what they say

337
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Bellator releases look like

338
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
And try to attach yourself to one

339
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
I said okay that sounds like a lot of work and I know no one so this

340
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,639
Not going to go out really didn't have those relationships right living in Atlanta

341
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
And living in La working in recording studio at no salt

342
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Yeah

343
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
So Cassandra callback

344
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
Eddie Murphy has a movie called boomerang

345
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
It's in production

346
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Perfect for your labor

347
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
You should go and meet Eddie

348
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,607
They should meet the producers in the director Reginald hudlin and Warrington hudlin

349
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
And convince them

350
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
I said you know

351
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Perfect

352
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
How did you get a meeting with him

353
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,311
I just called about the numbers I called their office and

354
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
I said hi this is LA

356
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575

357
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111

So they gave you meeting and end you flew up to New York to go to New York and I met them

I have to get

368
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
What was your pitch that was your pictures

369
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,063
My pitbull is basically that your movie is a reflection of who we are as music people

370
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
We are all cut from the same cloth

371
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
We write the songs

372
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
That your audience wants to hear

373
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,303
You know I don't remember exactly what I said but Boyle I must have been good that day

374
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
Anyway so they said okay great

375
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Now who was host

376
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Who's Distributing your life

377
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Innocent Clive Davis from Alistair Begg

378
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
They said okay well if you can get Clyde to come in

379
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Will do it

380
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
So I call Clive and ask him when you come to a meeting with the headlands

381
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Clive agree to do it

382
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
Came to a meeting with us Clive Eustis

383
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
His magic Charmin

384
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
We had a deal

385
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
And that was it

386
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
And how many artists of that point had you signed under under

387
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,583
Not many we probably had we just signed Toni Braxton with just signed TLC

388
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
And that was it and so you needed

389
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
Did to have enough artist to sing those songs but we had great relationship

390
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Types of talent

391
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,103
And we went to Boyz II Men and we asked Boys to Men to be involved in

392
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
We asked Johnny Gill to be involved we have

393
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Cuz you've been writing songs for these guys

394
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
It's already yes

395
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
And we put it all together

396
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
It became Boomerang was sold 3 million copies of the album

397
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
And

398
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
We launched

399
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Toni Braxton

400
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
We launched

401
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
TLC

402
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,095
Offset album and we won Grammys with Boyz II Men Four end of the road

403
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:18,495
So that album was the launch pad for our Label laface records

404
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,735
Wow so you can

405
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Really busy at this

406
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Yeah now I'm managing

407
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
You know Kenny and I'm managing

408
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
The artist on the label and

409
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,511
The songwriters and the rappers and a managing the relations

410
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Arister

411
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,399
And I'm also putting together a little staff and figuring that out and figuring out how to

412
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
Keep those doors open and keep the bills paid and

413
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
I learned

414
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
So what were some of the mistakes that you made

415
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
In a while your run

416
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Was there any

417
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
You did

418
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Take a look back on

419
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
I think that was just

420
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
Is really dumb or something to learn from that I'm glad it happened

421
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Because I learn from it

422
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
I think I really ran into my difficulties

423
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
When Kenny and I decided to seller come

424
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
2

425
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Eres Tu record

426
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
What did you decide to do that

427
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
I'd watch

428
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Berry Gordy built Motown

429
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
And sell it

430
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
I'd watch this as a business practice

431
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
I watched David Geffen build record companies and sell them

432
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
So a part of my goal

433
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
From the very beginning was

434
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
The building asset

435
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
That we could sell

436
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
The idea was that we could make a lot of money by selling this company

437
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,367
So you know we got our Stewart agree to buy the company from us

438
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
And there was one stipulation

439
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
This was like the

440
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Most difficult thing in life

441
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Probably my entire career

442
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,911
The owners of our stuff they said we'll buy your label but you'll have to agree

443
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
To a move to New York

444
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
You'll have to replace Clive Davidson takeover hours to record

445
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
As its president

446
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
The sky was your mentor

447
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
And also

448
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
Arguably the most famous

449
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,599
Record Executives in the world

450
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
In the World Records who was it was that tents

451
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Between you and him at all

452
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
We went through a very tough. We went to a very very tough.

453
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
And Clyde felt I betrayed him

454
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
NFL he'd ignored me

455
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
And ignored my opportunity

456
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Cash in on

457
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
The work that we do

458
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Done

459
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
So we both had

460
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Issues were

461
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
Put each other before that it happened

462
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Aren't you able to just have no it listen

463
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Going to cash out and move on

464
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Yeah

465
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
But that really wasn't

466
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
How it works

467
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
Because it wasn't an option for you I didn't want to move I mean I wanted to work

468
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
Yeah but I mean you could have cashed out and then gone

469
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Started your own thing

470
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Sort of but

471
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
The way it really works is

472
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
I'm the manager of the

473
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
The talent

474
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
And

475
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
What you're buying

476
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Is really me

477
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
You're not just buying

478
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
Those records that have already been massive

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Successful your buying

480
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
What do you hope to

481
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
The future will be

482
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
So

483
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
That's kind of how it work

484
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
How do the people that are so reactive

485
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
The people and arastoo

486
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Clive loyalist

487
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Didn't react favorite

488
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Night of the any of the other record

489
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Executives at the other labels or the media

490
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,192
All the artist community no

491
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Active favorably

492
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,520
And being all of a sudden being in charge of Carlos Santana and Whitney

493
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Career

494
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Along with all of my laface artists

495
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
It was bittersweet

496
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Because

497
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
3 years after I took over hours to record

498
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
We were

499
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Wild

500
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
More so than we were at

501
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
My face what was that word that success comfort

502
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
What light from which artists

503
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
An example was

504
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
We had pink

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Food sold 10 million albums

506
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
How did you discover

507
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
Pink was a great one

508
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,960
Sharon Daley was an assistant at our office I walked past her office

509
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
She's listening to a demo

510
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
I said hey what's that you're playing

511
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
She said I was just girls

512
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Philadelphia

513
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Turn it up

514
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
She turned it up

515
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
What's the weather look like she pulled out a picture and these three white girls

516
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
I thought they were black

517
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Oh my God this is really mad

518
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
One of them Alecia Moore

519
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
With the outspoken lead singer

520
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Who's about 16

521
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
But maybe 17 years old

522
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
And we signed the group

523
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Based on hearing that demo

524
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Walking down hall

525
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
And then once we sign them

526
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
I encouraged her to leave

527
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
The group and become a solo

528
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
And she left the group

529
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Change the name to Pink

530
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
Become a world-class *

531
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,720
How did you like how did you identify her as the one

532
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
The band

533
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
That was going to be

534
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,632
That's just one of those things you know if I get if I have a gift that is my gift

535
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
I love Talon

536
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
By the way I'm not any difference in the public the public knows also man of a great artist comes on television or on the radio

537
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,664
Republic always knows Lady Gaga that's great right

538
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,064
So I think of myself as a super consumer I don't think of myself as a professional

539
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I think of myself as a

540
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Fan

541
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
And anyway something became a fix

542
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Assassin

543
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
We had Usher who had a big

544
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Assassin Outkast

545
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
Had the Monumental success they won album of the year

546
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,472
They sold over 12 million copies of their album

547
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
But at the height of it all

548
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
I got fired

549
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Wait

550
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
But why

551
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm doing many things

552
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
We were we were really successful

553
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,296
So it wasn't Talent are you hard you think your hard work

554
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
I don't know that I'm

555
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Particularly deaf

556
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
I do believe that I'm very

557
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Other people who have my

558
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Job similar

559
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Play cat Hustle

560
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Look

561
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
If I'm in the room

562
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
With the other record exec

563
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,032
Pretty difficult did not notice me

564
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,712
20 years I've been the only black hat

565
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
So I definitely stand out in that respect you. That can be good and bad you know that's the reality of the world you know

566
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
And I am not

567
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,768
Playing any kind of a race car door complaining at all because I have a wonderful

568
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Career and I've been supported

569
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:12,192
Both by Executives and by the talent so I don't say that as an excuse for

570
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Getting fired

571
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Maybe I just pissed somebody off

572
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
And the takeaway was

573
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
If I

574
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Not sold my company

575
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
Then I wouldn't have gotten fired three years later because

576
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
I was the owner

577
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
How do you feel when when you lost a job like where you

578
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,768
I didn't get a chance to get upset was the weirdest thing I think in that moment

579
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
That I got fired

580
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
I felt like someone

581
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Iceman

582
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Ear

583
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
And I was

584
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
I saw Stars

585
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
4 sec

586
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
And as I'm writing down the elevator

587
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,152
You know from the skyscraper in New York City

588
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
And thinking about what just

589
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
To place again in my car

590
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
I call my lawyer

591
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,088
And I said you know I just got let go

592
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
He says yeah I know

593
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Call you right back

594
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,256
You literally called me right back within like

595
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
A minute or two

596
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
He says okay Doug Morris wants to see you

597
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
He's the head of Universal Music

598
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
He wants you to come to his office right now

599
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
So I drove directly to Doug's office

600
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
That day you were fired

601
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
Call DET hour

602
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,040
And 40 minutes later I was shaking hands with Doug Morris and I become the vice chairman of the Universal Music

603
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
Within within minutes

604
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Wow

605
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
And Ducks as you know I'm the luckiest guy in the world

606
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
They just let go of a great talent

607
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
And I'm so happy to have you

608
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
And Doug and I are still together today

609
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
So when you were fired from that was a

610
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Period when you then

611
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
Went to Universal and indigestion

612
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
Stuffed animals where you

613
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Usurp oversight

614
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Zio versus Island Def Jam

615
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Yes

616
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Is that where you sign Rihanna

617
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,968
Yes Rihanna came to my attention through

618
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,832
I heard now manager Jay Brown who was an A&R guy at the label

619
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,672
He brought a demo to my office one night I usually work really late at night

620
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
And he played me to Delmar said that sounds really good get her here

621
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,584
He brought it to New York City auditions for me and for Jay-Z

622
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Kjzi hired as

623
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
The president of Def Jam

624
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
We signed her on the spot

625
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
On the spot yeah it's always on the spot yet

626
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,896
Yeah I don't let people leave if I think you're going to be a big star I don't let you leave you know

627
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Sometimes people insist they can I think about this then the answer is usually no

628
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,880
You can't you need to do it right now because the minute you walk out my door

629
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,232
And other record Executives know that you're talking to me and I'm going to sign you

630
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
You have 10 offers at your daughter next

631
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
So I can't risk

632
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
Yeah

633
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
Do you see you've you have

634
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Foremost your career you

635
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
I've worked

636
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
With other beer companies

637
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Store for bigger companies

638
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Do you still work for a bigger so

639
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
The parent company now or right

640
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
But you still see yourself as an entrepreneur

641
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Oh I think so

642
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
Yeah because I still do

643
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
Music publishing you know as an.

644
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
Napa Norfolk

645
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
But I'm also an entrepreneur for the

646
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Major corporation

647
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
So you know the truth is

648
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
Maybe it's a little bit of my calling

649
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
To be a little bit

650
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Both

651
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Because

652
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
And I jumped at the Opera

653
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Opportunity right or wrong

654
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
You know or whether I handled it well or not

655
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
Whether it was difficult or not I jumped at the opportunity

656
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Become to work at Aeropostale

657
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
So I think there's something I liked

658
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
About the major corporation

659
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
It's something that they like about me being enough

660
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Give a miss

661
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,856
Timbermist like sitting in a room and and writing songs for other artists or do you

662
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880

663

I'm keeping all the balls in the air

671
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
That's what I love I love music first of

672
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Of course but I think I get

673
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Great

674
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176

Owner of Wawa

00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,048
While I tech company that makes very delicious coffee can says

729
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
Even though that coffee is instant and it comes in a little packet you don't always have the time

730
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,288
Time to grind your own coffee being able to just

731
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
Add Water wherever you are is

732
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,920
Pretty special in my opinion without compromising

733
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
The quality for

734
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Even the highest coffee snob

735
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,344
It says that he's actually going for a flavor that tastes as good as a

736
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
$4

737
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,768
