Okay here's the show

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
Do the same thing but I think there's also like we could have tried

20
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
To go any faster there's just not that much was in our control we didn't have a lot of money we didn't have a lot of info

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
A lot of connections so we're moving as fast as we could and that's kind of his that's as much as

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
You can do

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,240
From NPR how I built this

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movement

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Build Kickstarter and with it a culture of crowdfunding ideas

26
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
Might have never gotten off the ground

27
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
You know there's a kind of mythical narrative around

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
Startups especially if we're talking about tech startups and

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
It goes something like this

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Founder has an idea

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,784
Ben founder recruit some friends than friends sit in a room and start writing code

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,672
And then they try to get the app or the website out to the world as fast as possible and then

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
It just explodes blows up

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
Millions of customers sign up and investors.

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Beating down the door

36
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
But today

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
We have a somewhat different story

38
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
This is the story of Kickstarter and they did of course

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Start with an idea

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
But it took eight years before that idea

41
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Became a reality

42
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
The three co-founders did build a website but

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
None of them knew how to code

44
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,112
And he spent years refining the concept before anything even went live

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
And they were working with a very small amount of money

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
It's a path Less Traveled exam

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Much less likely to 6

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
It's not how I would recommend anybody

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Attempt to do this

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
This is Perry Chen what are the co-founders of Kik

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Kickstarter

52
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Harry grew up in New York City

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,616
We went to college in New Orleans where he was really into the local music and arts

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
And after he graduated he

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Came back home

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
To me you are counting like a lot of college graduates

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
I didn't know what he wanted to do

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
But he knew one thing

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
He needed to find work

60
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:12,000
I came back to New York and at the time I've been DJing a bunch of New Orleans and I start to work on my own music

61
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
I applied some record labels like you know

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Send my resume

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
To whatever the worst get job they have is where you like you're just stacking CDs on the Shelf

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Yeah but you're opening box

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
And

66
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Of course I never heard back

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,712
Answer that that didn't happen I don't think I had any idea and then I heard from somebody that they said that

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
A guy went to school with look

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Looking for Warm Bodies

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,344
To do what

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
2 Above All Things

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Day trade

73
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Did you know anything about

74
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,096
Nothing nothing nothing he just needed people to what to show up and do like

75
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Click buttons

76
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah you know I think at this time in early 99

77
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
What's kind of the Wild

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
X stock market

79
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
And

80
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
So I went down I talk to him

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
10 minutes

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
He like an idiot like an office and then had no it was like a large room

83
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,600
You know it was like a open floor before dressing like jeans and t-shirt and you know mostly

84
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
Guys mostly under 40

85
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
And you know he talked to me and he's like okay fine you know he's like

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
You come in you know will trade you

87
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
For 5 days

88
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Then you just go trade will put a small amount of money on your account you just trade another no clients not telling anybody anything

89
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
It's just this guy's money he's like if you

90
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Do well you know you'll get

91
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Some of that energy

92
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Keep down

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Just don't worry about it and then you know

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
That's it

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Yeah they were like you got it was something

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
Play Modest like $2,500 a month you know

97
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,719
I mean listen it was you. Beggars can't be choosers I was like sure what happened

98
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,559
Was literally just get sat down in front of a computer and

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Sitting there by yourself and you can buy or sell stuff in your decisions on like what I'm reading the Wall Street

100
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,079
Journal or no not at all I mean you're buying and selling something and in a minute

101
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Allow or 5 minutes or holding it you don't

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
You might not necessarily know the name of the company

103
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
It was like a combination of

104
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Mario Brothers and surface in the ocean I assume and I see a wave come

105
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Means you're like okay

106
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
It's simple it's a little instinctual

107
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
And

108
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
I did it for maybe

109
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,703
Little less than two years or so did you walk away from it with some listen cash

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,567
That was a little bit I mean nothing crazy but definitely decent for

111
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Somebody in their 20s

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
But you know after while I mean I was kind of like

113
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
What am I doing you know I'm not doing anything I'm not helping any

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
Best what I'm doing is neutral MMS telling somebody on any

115
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
I think so

116
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
The traitors like to think that there

117
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
Providing liquidity from great service but

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
You know it's it's your doing

119
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,095
Nothing you're shuffling some numbers from one computer to another

120
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
So

121
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
Judge had to go back to New Orleans it's much cheaper than New York

122
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,775
My intent was to just kind of really focus on working on music

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
Sick to get better as a as a producer

124
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
I'm kind of

125
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Pick up jobs here in Irvine

126
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Did the idea of Kickstarter

127
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Come to you

128
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
At that time

129
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
I think so I think it was

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
I always stay late 2001 early 2002 because to be honest

131
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
You know I can't remember but

132
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
You know what New Orleans jazz festival is kind of one of the

133
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
The two big breaks the year the right now other than Mardi Gras

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
So I wanted to throw a show

135
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
Where I was going to bring in these this to

136
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Electronic artists

137
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
From Austria

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Critter endorf

139
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
See that you fly them

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
From

141
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Vienna to New Orleans and have them do a gig

142
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,551
Sure I mean you know the hope is that though they would just happen to be in Mississippi

143
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,183
Yes I mean I was not an event promoter so this is all just kind of on the Fly

144
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
But

145
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
It didn't happen

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
And

147
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
It just kind of bother me

148
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
And why is it

149
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
The dad

150
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
I would need to

151
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Come up with the money and make this decision that this thing would

152
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Have enough people,

153
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
I I thought

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
What if the people that

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
Would want to come to the show could have a say in that

156
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
And if

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Enough people

158
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Could do that before a certain point then show can happen

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
And if not

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Ben it

161
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
That was it that was

162
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
At the beginning

163
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
And

164
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
What I remember most about like

165
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,559
Are good ideas all the time and and you know but within a little thinking you're going to find the Fatal flaw

166
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
And so what struck me most about it was like

167
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Confined

168
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
Edits so it stuck with

169
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And so I kind of

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Had this feeling I was like this is

171
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
This may be something

172
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
After that feeling I was like okay

173
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Cool

174
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Impacts of regular life

175
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Music

176
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
And

177
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Being in New Orleans

178
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Riding my bike

179
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
It's a good life like see your friends from high school or college

180
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Coffin and start

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Play careers in

182
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
Laguna Clara Finance anything

183
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,679
Yeah yeah maybe I should go into a career

184
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
No I mean you know what I felt was

185
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm living in New Orleans

186
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
I'm working on music

187
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
This is why people work for 35 years

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Retire

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
New Orleans twerking music

190
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
So

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
Am I jealous of my friend who works

192
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
70 hours a week

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
No

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
All right so you are so you're in New Orleans

195
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Your

196
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,839
Doing different things you have this idea that sort of comes and goes

197
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
And I guess around 2005 you move

198
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Back to New York

199
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Yes exactly May of 2005

200
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Who was the reason why he moved

201
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
I think it was a lot of things I mean I think that

202
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Partially because I was

203
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Moving

204
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Away from music a little bit

205
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
I was kind of fighting with it

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
You know what I think

207
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
A lot of times we have an idea right and you can

208
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
Put on the shelf of your brain

209
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
Somebody will say something at certain points in a remind you

210
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Yes I think that's kind of what happened

211
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,815
As I was getting close to probably in the final year of New Orleans isn't getting

212
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
Close time back to New York leaving year-and-a-half

213
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
I think I kind of came back in Moorpark

214
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Go away

215
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
I knew that

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Pepper soup

217
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
You knew that you were going to

218
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Previous idea to educated come back to you

219
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,175
Yeah part of the reason being to is that in New Orleans it would have been pointless

220
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
You know I don't know of any

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Tech Community

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Who's there

223
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
In the early

224
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
It might have been

225
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Certainly I wasn't

226
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
So yeah it was my plan A

227
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
When I bent my back to New York

228
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Well

229
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
I got a job

230
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Working at a restaurant in in Brooklyn that actually

231
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,543
Yeah you used to love you were a waiter there I was

232
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,639
And you know I'm at UNC after I've been at the restaurant for a little bit

233
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,735
Music at the time she would come in

234
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
We chatted a bit and we were like talk about music and

235
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,903
Baseball and then we just hung out a few times and end

236
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
Pretty early on we hung out maybe the second time or third time I kind of shared with him that I was working on this idea

237
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
His reaction when he told him he's had some brilliant idea

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
What's funny that that was not the reaction I mean it wasn't it wasn't the extreme opposite

239
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
Like I'm not sure

240
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
So

241
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,943
I don't know if my thought of time with that would be working together but I thought

242
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
You'll be worthwhile to

243
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Talk to him

244
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
And we started talking more and more about it and simultaneously becoming better and better friends

245
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
I think we

246
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
It just come naturally came together and set it to work together did either of you guys know anything about

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,935
Coding orbital the website or or anything like that

248
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
Well I certainly didn't throw any technical sense

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
I cannot code and I couldn't code

250
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
But I think I

251
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
How to send of

252
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
What a Chick-fil-A

253
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,807
I know what I like I know what I think feels good when I'm on a side

254
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
But

255
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
From the deep technical stuff

256
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
No

257
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
That was not my background at all Yancey probably have been closer but

258
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
He's not a cuddler

259
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
So what did you start

260
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
To do at that point to meet you

261
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Pinhead first

262
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
This idea and

263
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
And what were you doing during the day

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Yeah it was at first

265
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
I mean I was reading blogs

266
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
On the internet

267
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Bye

268
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
People who

269
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Had started

270
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Internet companies

271
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
I was reading about it

272
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,831
And maybe finding a friend or friend of a friend and you don't plan to give me telephone to talk to somebody

273
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
And I did it

274
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
It was slow going

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
But yeah you can learn a lot by just kind of

276
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Google Excel

277
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,631
HP Connected to two you have a third co-founder Charles Adler

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
We need

279
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Somebody was a designer user experience person

To help kind of

281
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543

We

00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
Work together kind of like almost everyday or every weekday

290
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Couple months

291
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,143
Your hand drawing like what the said look like Man drawing or 12 go into Photoshop or illustrator in

292
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Kind of like

293
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
You know just a rough

294
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Mock up stuff

295
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
You're getting into detail like

296
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Here's a button

297
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Here's a

298
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
A video

299
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
This is what happens when you click this

300
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Your real in depth

301
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
At the end of the document

302
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Pages about how the sight words

303
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
0 code

304
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,159
What was it what were you doing who are you making this for you making this her potential

305
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Investors or region

306
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Which is something that you guys would have

307
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
This was to make

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
This is not fair

309
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
This was just

310
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
You know what we would use

311
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
When we

312
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Had the money to

313
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Higher

314
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Developers to

315
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Build it

316
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
But this is critical

317
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Call you know you going to know what

318
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
When did you guys get investors

319
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
It was in 2006

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
I had a friend of mine

321
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
And her cousin is David Cross

322
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
The comedian from Arrested Development mr. show

323
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Great stuff

324
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
And so she

325
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Connexus

326
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
And we went and had a drink at a bar and I and I talked about the idea and and a few months later he invested

327
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
A little bit of money and that was our first investor and

328
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Two and a half more years for free of the lock the website

329
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
From your other early investors in 2006

330
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,807
I took a year-and-a-half so from that point probably from there too early 2008 we raced Maybe

331
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,207
$120,000 in a year and a half that was all of the money you had

332
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
To basically pay for server space or whatever you need to do to find a developer code

333
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
All these people

334
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
I think you know

335
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
At first like the working title for years in my mind was critical

336
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
Because it was very much of the mechanism of life

337
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
When you reach a critical mass of

338
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Park

339
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Then

340
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
I think it out

341
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah but you know I think

342
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
A lot of things

343
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Sisters

344
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Bicycle organization in NJ

345
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
It's really you mechanical

346
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Anyway so

347
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
I think it has been together.

348
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Grueling process

349
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Prezi what domain you can get

350
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
And yeah and then came out with this and

351
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Was able to get the domain for

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Appreciate

353
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
Tell me what the business model was from the

354
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Are the idea was exactly as you see it today which is

355
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
To charge

356
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Small fee

357
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
If and only if the project

358
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Sounded so

359
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
You know if a product and get funded another listing for you so

360
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
We would

361
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
Get nothing you have this plan

362
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
People would put their projects up if it's funded

363
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
You guys get a cut what's up percentage cut

364
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
5%

365
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
Soak City start with 5% if it's not funded

366
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
You get nothing

367
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Yeah

368
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,639
What's interesting about your story which is very different from a lot of other

369
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Tech companies is

370
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,319
You didn't just like get to a minimally viable product like in 6 months and

371
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Have it up and running like this

372
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
At least 3 years

373
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,279
Yeah I'm into two-and-a-half 3 years but very different from

374
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,143
More classical stories were it's like a couple of friends who worked in the industry who

375
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
May have connections or they can build it themselves

376
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
I don't think any of us had a sense of

377
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Where the end of the road was or where the goal was

378
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,663
Who went when the three of you like when Nancy and Charles and you would would serve

379
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Talk to other people in your life and you would say

380
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
I'm working on this and I'm trying to do this website and then you would see them again 6 months later

381
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
How long do you think people were skeptical or or whatever

382
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,351
You learn what it feels like to be a documentary filmmaker

383
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Laura reiter you know it's like you still working on the book I'm sure people thought that and I wouldn't blame them I'm a

384
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
It was long in the tooth for us certainly to

385
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
Aren't you getting stressed out that somebody else is going to

386
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Beaches punch in and do the same thing

387
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
I think that's certainly comes to mind

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
But I think there's also like

389
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
We could have tried to go any faster there was just

390
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Not that much was in our control

391
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,975
We didn't have a lot of money we didn't have a lot of influence with

392
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
A lot of connections

393
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
We're moving as fast as we could and that's kind of his

394
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
That's as much as you can do

395
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Why do you think you guys stuck with it

396
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Intersecting

397
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
People wouldn't normally lose patience right

398
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,199
So was it just that connection between the three of you guys like each other was at the idea or was just like

399
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
You just stuck it out

400
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
I think it was the idea

401
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
You know so many things don't have access

402
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,695
There aren't Industries or investors whatever set up around 2 fun things.

403
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Market Minot besides

404
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,119
And then even the things the market might be sizable enough that the deal you have to make to do that

405
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
You might have to contort your idea and something

406
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Start sit

407
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
What's your idea anymore

408
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Yeah or you just happen to have money

409
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Like this can't be the only way that

410
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Ideas can get

411
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
I think we saw it

412
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
You know

413
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Sometimes you just see it

414
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
I guess you're not always right

415
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
But just seeing it

416
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Is really critical and so

417
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
And where was changing over these years you know talking about 2005.

418
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
It only made us

419
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
See that what we're building made more sense

420
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Not less than

421
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Good morning

422
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Did not laugh if you would

423
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Engage with it more easily

424
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
With the rise of social media with the rise of YouTube

425
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Not laugh

426
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
And so

427
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
Of course is luck involved that that was Rising as we were taking our sweet time

428
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,391
Getting it going when we come back

429
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,999
The opportunities Kickstarter had to grow into a much bigger company

430
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
NY Perry Chen decided not to pursue any of them

431
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911

Capital One na

457
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,047
Welcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm guy rod

458
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
Who is Perry and his co-founders continue to make

459
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Slow progress on Kickstarter

460
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Competitors began to appear

461
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
In fact 18 months before Kickstarter went live Indiegogo another crowdfunding site

462
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Launched

463
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,783
I'm just wondering how you were able to

464
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,111
To withstand the uncertainty of it all.

465
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,255
Your recollection makes it sound like you were just sort of like yeah you know whatever will this is my thing and I have a plan B and

466
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
I want to do this but I mean

467
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Most people I think wouldn't

468
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
Feel that way they would feel

469
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Anxiety

470
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
About the uncertainty of

471
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
Do you think that you're just wired differently

472
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
I mean I felt a tremendous amount

473
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Radiator

474
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
But it wasn't that excited with driving me

475
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
And I think it normalized

476
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
A little bit over time

477
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
One of the things I noticed

478
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Not just as weird

479
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
Triangle on butt after we had launched that

480
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Those years were so trying

481
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
But I kind of had

482
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
To learn to adjust

483
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
I kind of like stay in the middle

484
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
Hey you don't have to get too high or too low because I think that both happen like

485
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
Somebody might invest small amount of money and we be like super site

486
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
You know

487
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Or

488
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
Hey we found a developer wants to work with us or whatever do little things

489
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Super excited

490
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Okay. Going to happen with

491
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,783
And then something happens where that doesn't come and you all look down and I think that happened so many times

492
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Ups and downs

493
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Dad

494
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,696
I think it just kind of I just maybe my defense mechanisms

495
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Kicked in tonight

496
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Force me to stay a bit more in the middle

497
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Either way

498
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
Right what's the name of steamed amazing happened or what

499
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Maybe sign that's him.

500
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
So what was the thing I mean

501
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
It was almost three years in the time that you form a company to the

502
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
The time that the website actually launch what was that

503
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
Who's the Triumph of what enabled you to actually make this thing

504
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Go live and become a reality

505
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
Well I think that

506
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
In some ways we made every mistake in the book

507
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Some kind of fruit did that we did one lap that way

508
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Classic stuff like

509
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
People with experience telling us

510
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
You know you shouldn't do something

511
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
This way

512
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
And us being like well

513
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
We appreciate that but like you know

514
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,216
It'll be different for us and then of course it's like exactly what I said happened

515
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Like duh

516
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
And so I think we had got a little experience after few years

517
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
But then they're just people you know we found amazing

518
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
People one of the people we met

519
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Was Andy Baio

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Who really helped us kind of

521
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
Figure out what kind of Technology we should be using and helped us interview the developers that we

522
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
Would hire and he didn't give him a first date

523
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
That was tremendously helpful

524
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Because none of us could

525
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Review the code that we were

526
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
The developers were

527
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
On the right track

528
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
So that was that was really critical

529
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Those things kind of

530
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Coming together

531
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah

532
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,520
When do you launch the day you launch

533
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
How did you get

534
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
The word that has people even

535
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Find out about

536
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
I think you leading up to when we actually

537
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Knew we were going to lunch or believes

538
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
Are we even talking to people about it

539
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,624
Telling people to try to build up

540
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,952
Projects collage on the side as well so there was that Outreach

541
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Waiting for the lodge Detroit

542
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Whatever their products

543
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
And I think we launched with Jenna maybe 5 or 10

544
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Projects

545
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
The first week

546
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
Did you remember what were those projects for

547
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
I think the first

548
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,384
One might have been drawing for dollars

549
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Which may be raised

550
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
10 or $15

551
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,528
Do you just contributed a Kickstarter campaign to that person

552
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Draw whatever

553
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
You know I can't recall whether it was that they're making a specific drawing but as part of a reward May did you get if I return dollars

554
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,096
They would also make one for you but it was great I mean it's amazing see anything I backed that project

555
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
Launch go on with our friend Claudia

556
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
The first day as well which is called New York makes a book

557
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
Which was trying to get people to give $30

558
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
And everybody who did will get a book and page in the book to submit

559
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Whatever material they wanted

560
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,016
And did Kickstarter make money right away like with a fees

561
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
The first 6 months I think was free

562
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
You know people don't even know what this is you know how much can you ask

563
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Pay money for

564
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,048
What was it do people notice it right away that you guys

565
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Right away

566
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,936
Realize it was successful or was it still kind of underground in the shadows

567
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
It was a very

568
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Suppose by the wrong word

569
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
Steady and I think that in the sense of that it

570
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
With things on the internet I think

571
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
We sometimes

572
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
This feeling of

573
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Oh my God one day

574
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Just 10 million people

575
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
It wasn't like that I know it was like the first

576
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,952
Wait there was 10 project in second week there was 20 in the third week there was

577
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
30

578
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,304
You know what does exponential saying but it was really nice and steady and

579
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
People got it

580
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
We have to go through a long. We're like

581
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Nobody guess this

582
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
We have to like change the whole bunch.

583
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
But it wasn't also like oh my God we have to hire

584
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
20 people tomorrow

585
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
I think we're very

586
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Fortunate in that

587
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
You know we're able to

588
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
Hire like one person a month

589
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Maybe

590
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Maybe even less than that

591
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
So we could kind of

592
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Build a culture

593
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Because it's not one day you come in

594
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Which is

595
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
It's hard it's hard to maintain

596
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,144
So as you guys in that first year as you started to kind of open up and allow anybody to to raise

597
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,728
You know money for the project what kind of projects are you getting

598
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
I mean it

599
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
You know it's amazing depth of the human imagination

600
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
You know like tattooing

601
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
That's wild

602
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
You know

603
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Anything you can think of

604
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Films

605
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
School plays

606
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Albums

607
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Concert

608
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
People who

609
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
Wanting to fund their residencies

610
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,416
Books A lot of people doing projects to

611
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Probably

612
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Weren't doing projects

613
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,096
Had ideas in this was an outlet for them like a format for them a lot of really Whimsical stuff

614
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:46,752
Podcast it was amazing to say it was really heartwarming I just loved it I loved it

615
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,152
Everywhere I went out and sought money

616
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,224
Money from Big names in the in the Venture Capital world

617
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Sokka and and in others

618
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,112
How did you go over the terms and you gave them was there was there any

619
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
Because once you do that you start to lose control

620
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
ONN

621
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Those investors they want

622
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,608
The only one exit strategy they want to know how quickly they're going to make money after

623
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
So how were you able to

624
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Attract investors and avoid

625
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
That trap

626
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,848
I think going into it we knew that we weren't building this to sell this and we weren't

627
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Trying to

628
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Credit public dump

629
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
And

630
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
When we went out for investment this was

631
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
You know one of the first things we discussed

632
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
First of all

633
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Was Chris sacca is Angelman

634
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
It was their personal

635
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
And that was kind of berry

636
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Purposeful

637
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
You know I think that they can say hey

638
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
Cool you guys want to do your thing and you're not going to try to eat the world

639
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
And

640
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,192
We're done with that ends are on money and it's not that much

641
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
So it's very different than

642
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
I think that a lot of

643
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
We did have one actual

644
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Venture capital

645
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Again not that much money

646
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
You need to raise money to

647
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Michelin Tire people in to expand

648
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
Kickstarter

649
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Yeah it's a

650
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
Can I actually just tell her that you in a modest even a tiny modest one

651
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Getting a salary at all

652
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,352
No I thought you know I think that there was some sort of

653
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Irregular

654
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
Bruno 3000 bucks a month

655
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
If you're there for me and maybe me or Charles

656
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
But

657
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
Yeah we're getting ready to charge your money at this point so there's no guarantee of

658
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
That continuing

659
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Ring for very long

660
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
In India

661
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
First year after launch what

662
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
What was your salary

663
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
Either 60 or 60

664
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
$1,000

665
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Yeah

666
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,952
So at what point did Kickstarter

667
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
Become profitable

668
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
I think you know the first 6 months

669
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
Not at all no Revenue

670
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
I think we've been a year after that

671
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
I was in the first

672
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
18 months

673
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
We got in the black

674
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
And you were there

675
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
The CEO

676
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
I was

677
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
And added you

678
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Yuan

679
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Kickstarter became more popular

680
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,736
A lot of companies that were making

681
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Gadget

682
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Extang

683
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,112
Were using to Kickstarter say way too kind of

684
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Prototype

685
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
There

686
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,768
They're saying that was out there some companies raising millions of dollars

687
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
I guess that at a certain point you guys just had enough we're not

688
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
Doing this anymore and you

689
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
Is the quote that I read that you gave was we're not

690
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
A store

691
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
You kind of

692
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,568
Stopped allowing Kickstarter to be used as a platform for

693
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
For these kinds of things right

694
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Well it's

695
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,712
It's not entirely accurate I mean basically what happened was that

696
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
We created

697
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Additional

698
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Process

699
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
4

700
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
Product design

701
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Project

702
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
And

703
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
They had more of a review process

704
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,512
Other projects may be more classical

705
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
Creative areas

706
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Like an album

707
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
I didn't

708
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
And

709
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
That was really because

710
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
You know we saw that

711
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
The danger of people

712
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Kind of

713
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
Approaching

714
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
Kickstarter her and things are being put up there

715
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Like new Prada

716
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
I'm buying this like I'm buying something on Amazon like I was going to come exactly the date

717
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
They're saying and

718
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
We felt that that needs to be understood that Kickstarter is not a store

719
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,856
If you support a short film

720
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,696
You don't expect this short film to be the best short film you ever saw

721
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Write 1 people by like a

722
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Gadget

723
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
People can have

724
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
More of a consumerist

725
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
So we said

726
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
Hey you need to show where your prototype

727
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
You need to add

728
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
The risks and challenges of

729
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
In the checkout process we had

730
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
Pixar is not a store and we link to some of our policies

731
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Just let people know

732
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
What does a product need to do to get

733
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Hear what we might know and what we

734
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
Might not know

735
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
And

736
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,648
We want to let people be able to then make the Judgment of their own butt

737
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
With a little bit of context from us

738
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
A company came to the kickstarter

739
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
And you know said hey you know what the

740
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Coolant product light

741
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
What headphones do something

742
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
King and I

743
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,496
And we want to partner with Kickstarter to raise money

744
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,128
Kickstarter will do some promotion for us feature that the headphones in the homepage Drive traffic to it

745
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
And then an exchange you know we'll get Kickstarter

746
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
I think I might like

747
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Like 10%

748
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,576
Could you imagine doing something like that

749
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
No I don't think so it's probably had

750
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Probably a game request like

751
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
In the past

752
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Listen to site

753
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
Is open you log on your credit password

754
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
You put your project

755
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,728
I picked a lot of times big companies that want to do a partnership they want to sign a contract that's

756
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,288
If you want to go do it to go log on the side

757
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
If you want like some special stuff from us or

758
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,456
Whatever I mean that's just not we do it's a relatively open door but you're not

759
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Any better than

760
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
Some young Creator who

761
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,856
Working on their first idea this platforms built

762
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
To do what you say you want to do so

763
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
You know

764
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Gopher

765
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
How much money has

766
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,608
Internal leasing capacitor projects raised

767
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Recently

768
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
We passed the three billion dollar

769
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Pledge mom

770
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Wow

771
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
So huge milestone

772
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Yeah.

773
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
Excited about

774
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
The money that's gone to projects. Really had very little

775
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
Funding sources are really constrained funding sources are funding sources that would really

776
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Boris The Creator to contort their projects in a way that they

777
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Might not recognize it anymore

778
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Force them to kind of makeup

779
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Compromises that a lot of crazy people have to do

780
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
But they're really hard

781
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
That's definitely what I'm

782
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Most proud of

783
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:39,520
I've seen Kickstarter describers like that the People's National Endowment for the Arts and people is even

784
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,848
Who discovered as likely modern-day House of Medici

785
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
Which is pretty complementarity I mean it's a pretty incredible thing to say about

786
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
About the site that

787
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
You created you

788
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Do you identify with us

789
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Descriptions

790
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
Not really I mean

791
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Listening

792
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
I'm proud

793
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,328
But you know the medicis were giving up large amounts of money and it was a small group in a way we're trying to

794
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,144
Provide a clear alternative to that

795
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
We know that

796
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
Whitman had funded some first editions

797
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
By having

798
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Subscribers that he

799
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:17,920
Brother names in the first edition get smaller amounts in Mozart Concerto in the same way

800
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
Statue of Liberty the base was funded

801
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
They actually the

802
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
They would some Miniatures for a dollar or larger one for $5

803
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Why not that fun

804
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Did the bass

805
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
So

806
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
A lot of stuff that you see on the web is

807
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Has maybe B

808
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
Existed

809
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
In another form nothing new Under the Sun

810
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
Pretty much it would Kickstarter

811
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
If I was telling a friend that I was working on an album and it

812
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,752
Can I talk to somebody to go into a studio to mixdown

813
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
They're not going to hand me $5

814
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Write in a coffee shop

815
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,688
But if I put it up on Kickstarter and I'm trying to raise two grand to go to my next off my album

816
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
That's in front of me give me $5

817
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,344
There was just this friction there was this social friction before that existed

818
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
And

819
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
The model has been able to eliminate that or even

820
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
But in a way that's socially positive

821
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
So it's the sentiment people have people want to help

822
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Each other

823
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Bring

824
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Good

825
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,216
An interesting ideas to life

826
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
We have nothing to do with that

827
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
We are

828
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Enabling

829
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
What we think is a good weight

830
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,688
The idea of the model of Kickstarter is just

831
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
Seems like a no-brainer not really think about

832
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Companies like Uber or Airbnb or

833
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
You coming to connect people with other

834
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,696
People and in some ways Kickstarter does the same thing

835
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
And

836
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
You guys only take 5%

837
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
Which is a pretty small amount of money

838
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
You could take

839
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Lots more money

840
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Did you

841
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
Think about it

842
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
I mean

843
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,640
If you're going to try to make a lot of money you know that's almost change the fee is probably not where people

844
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
We'll talk about that we talked about

845
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,576
Raising hundreds of billions dollars and venture-capital quadrupling the size of the company and the international footprint

846
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,136
Doing major marketing campaign or

847
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Selling the company and

848
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
Making a ton of money

849
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
And one shot

850
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
But I think there's also like

851
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
There's got to be a way

852
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
But it doesn't have to become this kind of vehicle

853
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Only four

854
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Maximize

855
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Prophet

856
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
You know

857
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
It was a quote I wish I could find

858
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
The attribution bias

859
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
We basically that

860
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
If a corporation was a person

861
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
It would be such a

862
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
And

863
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
When you create something

864
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
If you wanted to

865
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Cher

866
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Your values

867
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
That's kind of why I ever since

868
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
The beginning we wanted to make sure to

869
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Hold on to

870
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Controls

871
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
Outside forces couldn't drive it that way

872
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
And then

873
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
Two years ago we became a public benefit Corporation

874
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
Which is still up for profit

875
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Company but

876
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
It means that the

877
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
Obligations of the

878
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
Of the board and executives

879
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
And the company is to balance

880
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
The shareholder interest

881
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
With

882
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Greater state

883
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Including

884
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
The environment and

885
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
And your various community

886
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
And that's it that makes it again something more

887
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
A representation of people

888
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,560
But really underneath the Mandate is

889
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
At the end of the day and make the most money for shareholders

890
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
It's a really

891
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
It's not really a good fit

892
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
For humans and I don't think it's

893
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
It portends very well for society

894
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
If it's what we accept

895
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
As the only way to do

896
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,760
You are you are no longer the sea yeah right

897
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
No now I'm chair

898
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,880
And it was the Target on that did you just feel like a day you know it's

899
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
It's got a new place where I don't care I need to run it on a day-to-day basis anymore

900
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
Yeah I mean I think that

901
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
Once we were out there

902
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
And

903
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Things for work

904
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
I started to see that

905
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Especially since we

906
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
Don't want to sell

907
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,800
Where's this go if things continue to

908
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,408
Then it just continues

909
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Just continue

910
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
But does that mean I do this

911
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,600
Till I can't do this then Doric do this for 30 years and then I write a book on leadership and I could give

912
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,952
It's like you know so I was like

913
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
And I also didn't have

914
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Time to work on other ideas I had

915
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,608
In the Arts. Do companies and so

916
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
I think we were just there when I just started the window I start to see

917
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,800
Hey you know a gust of wind is going to blow us down we got a great team here

918
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
And so

919
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616

I Have Nots I've never seen those guys and I haven't heard that much I'm sure they're still out there making music

923
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:50,048
I haven't even been caught up on my crush right now you could kick-start that show now if you did for the truck

924
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448

The first purchase

942
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,104
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

943
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
And let's just say that

944
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Our team actually got into an argument about this next product because the problem it's meant to solve

945
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
Well some people didn't even know this problem existed

946
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Like

947
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,792
In your bedroom right if you just throw quilt over your bed to make it then you may not get this

948
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
If you have a duvet or a comforter then you know the extreme frustration of trying to

949
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,080
You stuff it back into the duvet cover it says if you're taking it a big pillow

950
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
And trying to fit into its pillowcase but it's bigger than you are and you could Crystal Gordon from San Diego

951
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
Why do you have to you know get on top of the bed shake it so that it all fits properly and neatly and it's not all crumpled

952
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:57,280
Bullet inside of its cover and if you've never had to do this you know exactly

953
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,864
Something she had to do when she was a kid

954
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:06,752
Anyway now that Crystal is a mom herself she's always looking for ways to save time

955
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,640
And so one day about a year ago she thought Spade why don't I design something that makes it

956
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
Easier to put the duvet back into the cover

957
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
It needed to be absolutely simple that is Standalone you don't have to hook up any wires or any hooks

958
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,024
And doesn't require assembly or any of that Crystal actually has a background in aerospace engineering

959
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,632
But why can't a designing something to help you make a bed

960
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
I had no idea how to invent something so I started toying with things I I read a book on basically

961
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Inventing things

962
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
And bought some stuff from Home Depot

963
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
But really basic stuff they're like rope some clothes pins and a kitchen sponge which he litter

964
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:57,440
Early staple together into a kind of clamping device that was my ultimate first Raw

965
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
Prototype 2 just passed my theory of

966
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:06,400
Having this cushion underneath the mattress to work as an anchor and then and what Crystal Adventure

967
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,240
Actually came up with is a flexible clamp actually two of them

968
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,568
That you can use at the top two corners of the bed

969
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
The clamps are kind of liking it to the hands of somebody else there you're helping hand the clamps

970
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
Are shaped like a spatula with his little plastic gate in the middle that can hold the duvet cover

971
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:32,768
Cover in place as you push the duvet into it and you can do this task alone in

972
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
In a few seconds with with very minimal pain and time after she's settled on her

973
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
Final prototype crystal found a manufacturer in Turkey to make it she calls her invention the

974
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Duvaid

975
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,200
There's nothing like it that exists we have no competition Crystal

976
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Biggest challenge right now

977
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Getting the duvaid into brick-and-mortar stores

978
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,648
She's been selling some of them online just a few hundred dollars worth so

979
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
For now she's keeping her day job at a solar energy company and whenever she can have got my list of store

980
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
I've been trying to call with nobody picking up the phone and you know I need to start getting more creative sending them like

981
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
Chocolate the box of chocolate there's something with my card in it

982
