Hey it's guy here

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
You know Sadie Lincoln still remembers the name of the

13
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
Very first person who signed up for a membership with

14
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
Barre3 back in

15
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
2008

16
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,184
Which is pretty incredible because at the time she was also.

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
Teaching 19 classes a week

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
And cleaning the bathrooms at the studio

19
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,400
Today there are barre3 studios in 33 States

20
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
Sadie also joined us for our first-ever how I built this Summit last month and she shared some helpful tips on

21
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
How to build a grape

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
Company culture right from the start

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,456
If you want to check out a video of Sadie from The Summit

24
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Just posted it

25
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,528
At our how I built this Facebook page

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Go check it out

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
Anyway this episode with Sadie first roundabout

28
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
A year ago

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
One evening we put the kids to bed I'll never forget that swear in

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
In the living room and Chris came up to me and he pulled a spreadsheet out of his pocket

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
And he said Sadie I've been holding us in my pocket for a couple weeks

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Open it up and it was a spreadsheet a model of how we could

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Seller home all our possessions and drop out and not work

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
And that was the spark to building

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,848
Running PR

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
How I built this

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
A show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Stories behind the movements

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
Lego

40
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,024
Lincoln turned a room with mirrors and a ballet bar into a multimillion-dollar company

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Let's not one of the fastest-growing fitness programs

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Us

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
So if you want to take a little bit of

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Pilates in some yoga

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
And then throwing some ballet into the next

46
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
You get bar

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
It's actually been around since 1959 when a former ballerina named Lottie Burke invented the whole car

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Concept in London

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,464
But you didn't really begin to take off in the US until this past decade

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,328
And today there are more than 700 Barre studios around the country

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,680
Companies like core Fusion physique 57 and Pure Barre

52
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
The people who go to Barre classes

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Overwhelmingly women

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Most of them are just

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Going to the exercise is there actually connected to the

56
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Culture around the whole bar movement

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,808
It's about building confidence in a steam but it's also big business

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,416
The whole Boutique Fitness sector which bar is definitely a part of

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
Is now a 30 billion dollar industry

60
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
And one of the best-known faces of bar

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Sadie Lincoln

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,448
Her company barre3 now has about a hundred and Thirty locations all around the world

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
And the company is still privately owned by Sadie and her husband Chris

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Just one outside investor

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,200
All of this has of course made them rich and in Sadie's case

66
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
It's made her a celebrity Fitness Guru

67
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Which as you will hear

68
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Has made her very uncomfortable

69
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,976
Because Sadie isn't actually is flashing and slick as her online videos would suggest

70
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
In fact her upbringing

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
It was pretty unconventional

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
My mom and her four best friends

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
Dropped out their part of the counterculture

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,848
Translate they live in California and they just dropped out they were living in California yet they found each other

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
They're kind of gypsy like they're traveling around together they ended up in Taos New Mexico

76
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
And each of them

77
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Ended up having a child

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
The dads off

79
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
And they

80
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
Basically raised us kids collaboratively

81
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
That's what I mean was that there

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
Your plan like to all these women to move to tylosand

83
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
You know basically have children and then

84
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
Ultra raised up these children together

85
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Because it

86
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
I mean that's how it works out

87
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
Is that how they thought it was going to work out I don't think they had a plan

88
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
I think it just happened and it was a time of

89
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Serration

90
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
It was a time for them to

91
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Go inwards

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Look inside

93
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Live close to Nature

94
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Chester intellect

95
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
And create and discover a new way of living

96
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Number 5 kids

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
All together

98
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Soul artists

99
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
8 years older than me so she's sort of like an honorary Auntie anyway but lark

100
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Sophia

101
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
GI

102
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Kyle

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Megami

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Sussex

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
First Fitness

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,503
Part of your Early Childhood we used to do what we called the Tea Party

107
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
Tanya rad record and Boogie

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Dance our butts off

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
Bob Dylan Willie Nelson and Chuck Berry

110
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
The Beatles of course

111
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
We did that as a family often

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
So that was my first introduction to just

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Loving moving

114
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
Does your mom like make ends meet

115
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
Well first of all we are off and on food stamps

116
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
I do have memories of going to the

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,711
Store with food stamps with a note for my mom that I could use them and thinking of this is I have different money than other people

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
But

119
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
They did and that

120
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
I meant went once they got secure and they had some

121
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Ability that they created their own

122
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Are they created a newspaper called what's happening and then changed it in later years to Eugene weekly which is still the weekly

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Publication in Eugene

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
Yeah did you sometimes

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Feel like a weird kid like a different kid

126
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Yes I felt like a weird kid

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
And

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Then I

129
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Tried to play Norma

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
You know I thought I played normal for a long

131
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Kind of I don't want my friends

132
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
That I had this alternative

133
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Out of the box family I was really attracted to

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Normal kids normal families

135
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Were you embarrassed

136
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Oh yeah

137
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Yeah I was in bear

138
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,047
I mean my mom was wearing Birkenstocks before they were cool they were smoking weed

139
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Before it was late all they were

140
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Outrageous annies

141
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Now I think

142
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
It's wonderful that back then

143
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
You know I wanted to

144
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
To be I was like Alex Peak

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
And Family Ties

146
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Kind of

147
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
I was like

148
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
You know I became a cheerleader

149
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,551
You know which is very you know of course they all supported me because that's what they do unconditional love no matter what your choice is

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Ana's really social

151
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
I just want to be normal

152
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
2

153
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
Were you a pretty good student

154
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
In my school

155
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Horrible skin

156
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Really bad

157
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
I went to Alternative School called magnet Arts

158
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
I developed a great deal of confidence there

159
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
You know we did

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Pottery and dance

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
And music and

162
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
But I didn't learn the basic

163
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,991
And then Middle School I entered middle school and I didn't have the foundation

164
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Nor the interest

165
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
And so I just kind of survived on

166
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Having fun

167
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,767
So After High School Sadie took off for La. Should become an actor

168
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
And in the meantime she started to take classes at Santa Monica City College

169
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Actually liked it

170
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,007
A couple years and she transferred to UCLA

171
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:44,639
And it was during that time she got really into fitness classes so after college

172
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Sadie decided to look for work

173
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
In the fitness industry

174
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Yeah

175
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,599
I landed a job with a company called 24 Hour Fitness

176
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
And

177
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
The reason I took that job really was I wanted to move to San Francisco to live with my girlfriend I lived in on her dining room floor

178
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Four letter lie

179
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
And

180
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
They were based on the bay area and Fitness

181
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,727
What was the job that you were hired to do

182
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
I was hired to run

183
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
All of the group exercise for I think 25 gem

184
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Wow is it

185
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
We were acquiring gems

186
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Got to wrap it

187
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
Okay so I started I think we had around 50 gems

188
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
I ended up staying there for 11 years

189
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
When I laugh react 430 location

190
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
So this was just

191
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Massive explosive growth

192
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,559
Explosive growth I thought I was going to work there maybe to one to two years and

193
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
I ended up

194
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
Reporting directly to the founder and CEO

195
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Mark masterov

196
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,543
And he just kept igniting interest in me because he gave me all these incredible projects along the way

197
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
So everything from sales

198
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
2

199
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,967
Brand strategy which is my favorite I mean it was the ultimate

200
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Learning

201
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
Experience for me I traveled all over the world

202
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
Alter Scandinavia and

203
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Asia and

204
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Spain

205
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Italy

206
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,047
Mark had other businesses besides 24hourfitness that I got to be apart of gems in Russia

207
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
So he's like a major

208
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Fitness Mogul there is no one

209
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
Greater I mean in the fitness industry he's known even Tuesday yeah oh yeah

210
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
OKC to you are at 24 Hour Fitness

211
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Exploding in growth

212
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Is that where you met your husband Chris

213
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
I'm at Chris in San Fran

214
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Just outside of

215
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
24-Hour Fitness

216
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
QuiBids work

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Game for a startup software company

218
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
I met him at a Super Bowl party

219
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
And we connected instantly his last name is Lincoln

220
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
And I meant he introduced himself as Lincoln everybody called him Lincoln and I remember in that moment thinking Ash my name is going to be Mercedes link

221
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
My real name is Mercedes so I knew that insta

222
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Wow yeah I knew

223
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
I know

224
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Q41

225
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
And

226
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
He

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
After a couple inches with Mark

228
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Mouse Drive

229
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Mark pulled Crescent to the loop

230
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
As well so he ended up working direct for Mark as well

231
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
And so Mark now had me and Chris and he would put us on Project

232
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
So it's a wonderful testing ground for us as business partners

233
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
To see how we work together

234
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
Chris is really analytical really grounded

235
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
I'm more the new shiny thing

236
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Dreamer

237
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
Ennui

238
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Bought a house

239
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
Which is like climbing Mount Everest in the Bay Area

240
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
Which is really exciting to find a moment for us for me especially I

241
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
I rented

242
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Michelin Tire

243
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Life growing up

244
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
So how actually owning a home with Incredible

245
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
We had two children back-to-back 18 months apart

246
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
So I mean

247
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
You're living in the Bay Area and you've got this gig with Mark and both you and Chris are kind of doing projects for him

248
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
And

249
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
What what happens if you have a scissor some sort of Crisis that kind of propels you to make a big life change

250
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Will the first

251
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Prices for me

252
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
I think happened before I was pregnant with my first

253
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Child eye

254
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,271
Even though I was part of this booming business and my career was booming

255
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
And I was making it

256
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
Great salary and you know we're buying a house and all that good stuff

257
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
My own health was declining

258
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
And I didn't feel good

259
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,655
You know I've just been immersed in the fitness industry but it wasn't working in my own body I was

260
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
I was

261
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,311
Really uncomfortable in my own skin I don't feel alive inside that make sense

262
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
I

263
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
With working out really hard everyday

264
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,527
Running on the treadmill counting how many calories I was eating and how many calories I was

265
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Spending because that's scientific

266
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
Calories in calories out doing all the right things

267
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
That I had learned where it was the formula for success in this is

268
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Multi

269
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
Billion dollar industry I was in with working

270
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Selling like hotcakes

271
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
And

272
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
This attachment to an idea

273
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
I was sort of drinking the Kool-Aid

274
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
And

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
I was shameful that I wasn't looking that idea or feeling that idea

276
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
So what changed

277
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
When I got pregnant with Audrey

278
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
I think

279
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Being pregnant is the ultimate

280
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
Opportunity to realize

281
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Because

282
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
If you think about it inside your body

283
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
I I was craving a baby without

284
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Thinking about it

285
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
And I never felt more alive and connected and happy

286
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
For me becoming pregnant reminded me

287
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Add my grits

288
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
My auntie's

289
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,151
The power of intuition what healthy really Wyatt's with living close to Nature being intuitive forces following someone else

290
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
The formula

291
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
And I had this a high thyroid to do yoga at home

292
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
And I had this

293
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
This Moment of clarity I'll never forget it

294
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
At where

295
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
I literally said

296
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Myself

297
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
Maybe I'm not feeling sadness

298
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Maybe Fitness is failing me

299
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
And

300
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
I'm probably not alone

301
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Even though in the fitness industry is booming the vast majority of us it's not working I mean that's the new

302
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
New story on the news everyday

303
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,871
It's like Abby cities on the rise people are more stressed out than they ever have been

304
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
There's all these magic spells magic answers formulas that were also Desperately Seeking

305
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
You having this conversation with your husband

306
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Chris

307
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
I would say the conversation

308
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
Chris and I are having more at that point versus Fitness is failing or not

309
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Was we were alone

310
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
Really lonely as a couple

311
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
We were having a hard time finding belonging

312
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
We don't have a strong community

313
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,311
And like is this it likes it just you and me you know

314
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
What's going on he was having a hard time relating to

315
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Business as he was

316
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Managing

317
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,783
Vista Studios he was managing with 24 Hour Fitness in

318
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,879
You know I just I remember this one moment walking into the room and

319
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
You was on speakerphone and the manager that was working with

320
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Coaching him there on a conference call

321
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
The guy and he was did it with such great intention but he would

322
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,679
And nobody could see each other so he was saying okay everybody raise your right hand

323
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Now put it on your back

324
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
The lift it up

325
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Now put it back down

326
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Now lift it up

327
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Put it back down

328
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
So he was having a run on the conference call Pat there and back

329
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
And Chris instead of doing that was flipping off the screen

330
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Right

331
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Something needs to change

332
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
So we felt empty there wasn't a sense of purpose

333
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
So what did you do

334
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
So we started

335
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,095
I mean over the year is over like maybe a two-year

336
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
He was coming up with all kinds of different business

337
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Plant watering business

338
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
The pizza

339
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
2 Nail Studio tour

340
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
And

341
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
So that was sort of in the backdrop

342
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,199
But also it was like I had this good gag I was working from home I had two babies

343
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
I'm he had a

344
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Good job I mean

345
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
We had bought our house

346
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
So I feel like things are kind of moving along pretty pretty well

347
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
And one evening

348
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,071
We put the kids to bed I'll never forget that's where in the living room and Chris came up to

349
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Tumi

350
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
And he pulled a spreadsheet out of

351
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
And he said Sadie I've been holding us in my pocket

352
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Her

353
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Couple weeks

354
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
And

355
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
And I just need a sheriff

356
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Can you open it up

357
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
And it was a spreadsheet

358
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
A model

359
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Of how we could

360
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Seller home

361
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
All our possession

362
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
And move to Bend Oregon

363
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
And drop out

364
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
And not work

365
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
4

366
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Well and

367
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,655
Yo I'm the one that's usually thinking of these outrageous ideas he's more conservative and

368
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Super analytical first

369
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Himtoo

370
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Bring me this outrageous

371
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Idea

372
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Was honestly one of the hottest things

373
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
Because I was just like you see me

374
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Eufy Adventure

375
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
And

376
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
It's also a reflection of how is

377
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Raised

378
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
It gave us permission

379
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Think outside

380
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Of

381
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Any kind of

382
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Donburi

383
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
If we can not work for a year

384
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
What can we really do

385
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
So that idea morphed into

386
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Let's sell the house

387
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Every single penny

388
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Into

389
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
I dream job

390
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,311
That might fail but we don't care let's just try to

391
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Build a life for yourself

392
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
That

393
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,455
Will feel like dropping out that will feel

394
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Free

395
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
And

396
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
That was the spark to building

397
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
But we.

398
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,463
And so with the money you move to

399
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Bend Oregon

400
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Deciding on Portland

401
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Because

402
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,191
I wasn't as excited about then you know I wanted to be in a more thriving

403
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Urban Market

404
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
How much cash did you guys have to live on

405
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,943
I don't remember the exact number but I can tell you this we went down to one car we packed all of our belongings into

406
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
The car

407
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,831
I'm moving van we moved our two kids are cats Portland Oregon we rented a small little house

408
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
We just went down to the bare minimum

409
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
And how much did you have to

410
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Put towards

411
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
This business

412
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
So our only investor

413
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
This day is marked

414
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
So he he said hey

415
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
All all work with

416
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Yeah it so he gave us

417
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Small investment

418
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
I want to say I like under 200000

419
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
And then our house

420
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Which

421
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
So we probably had maybe

422
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Three or four hundred thousand

423
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,455
And that was with a Christian Life

424
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
Poured much of that into this business idea

425
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
Yeah so what what was the

426
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
The concept that you guys started to work on when he got

427
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Oregon

428
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Well

429
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
I became enamored with

430
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Studio

431
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
And

432
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,679
Going to yoga studios going to Barre studios in the late 90s early 2000

433
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Barb

434
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
Reigniting and New York and in Sanford

435
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
It's just for people who have no idea what bar has

436
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Can you explain it a little bit

437
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Little bit more

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Yeah

439
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
Well bar back then was

440
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Based off of the Lodi brick method

441
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
Which she was a dancer who we happen

442
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
Kristoff basically at a ballet bar and

443
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
Her first instructors start at the first Bar Studios

444
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Confusion

445
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,279
57 Bar Method there's a bunch of them out there

446
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
And they sort of had a Renaissance

447
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
In the early 2000

448
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,447
And I started to take those classes and I was as intrigued by them

449
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
How come

450
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,031
For one thing they reminded me of

451
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Part of a contemporary

452
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Jawzrsize

453
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
And then using the ballet barre

454
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
As a prop

455
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Just has this

456
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
Instant Grace and art and Heritage

457
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
That was really attractive

458
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Tumi

459
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
And when you got into when you decided to

460
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Open a bar

461
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
There were

462
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
Competitors

463
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
So did you think

464
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
How are you able to say well we're going to be different

465
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
This way or track customers by doing this

466
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Yeso

467
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
We moved to Portland

468
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
A conscious decision where there was no bar

469
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Around us

470
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,223
And I love using the ballet barre I love the isometric work of Lotte Berk

471
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
And the small movements

472
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Animusic

473
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
But I wanted to create a studio

474
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
That instead of

475
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,511
Being something didn't answer being a methodology I didn't want to be the Sadie Lincoln method or the barre3 method

476
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
I just wanted it to be an exercise

477
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Experience

478
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
From the very beginning in R instructor manual

479
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
The very first sentence

480
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
The one thing that never changes at barre3

481
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
If we're always

482
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
At the very beginning of class

483
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Commissary instructor will start by saying

484
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Walking to barre3

485
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
I give you full permission to do something different than I say

486
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Your only job

487
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Adolescent

488
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Not to me but yourself

489
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
I'm your guide

490
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,951
Turn the music on I'm going to show you how to line your body and then I want you to make it

491
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Your own

492
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,583
The chest as an idea to introduce people I mean obviously

493
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
The people on the show up

494
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
Taking the classes right but

495
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Like

496
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
When you passed by

497
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
The studio

498
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
You saw this

499
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Barre3

500
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Carrie

501
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
A lot of people may be sick from speeding

502
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
For men I guess I don't know

503
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
Probably betraying my

504
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Stupidity

505
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,927
Would say what is Bareilles like what is this thing right and so I can't be the only person

506
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
Thought that when I first saw it

507
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,119
Nobody knew how to pronounce it nobody knew what it was I had a tagline at the beginning where ballet barre meets

508
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Yoga and pilates

509
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Wichita

510
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,775
Right to it too it was a descriptor to explain what it was

511
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,103
How did you come up with a routine did you spend like

512
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Weeks in months kind of

513
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Writing it down or

514
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
White hot for about 20 years all different concepts

515
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,367
And so I started a piece together

516
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
The

517
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
Concepts that balance the body so

518
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,791
I really focused on working opposing muscle groups in every x-ray

519
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
So if I work the bicep I was going to

520
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Weekly work the triceps

521
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
So I had this host

522
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
When you open your doors and is August 2018

523
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:04,127
Was it right away was it like a hit two people over people like letting us come in Wizard of curiosity

524
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,967
Got before I even opened our studio I taught free classes

525
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Upstairs

526
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
At what is now Whole Foods but at the time

527
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Kind of Wild Oats

528
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
And

529
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,903
Never forget the day we finally got our

530
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
Permit to open the doors

531
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,048
I sent out an email to the community that was coming to my free classes

532
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
And I said hey I got my

533
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
Certificate of occupancy

534
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
I'm going to teach a class 2

535
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,776
And I thought maybe a couple people that show up you know my friends my good friends that I've made

536
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
On 12 people showed up

537
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
That night

538
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,664
And I sent out the email at 2 and I think I taught it 5:45

539
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
And I will never

540
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Forgot that moment

541
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
The sun was coming in

542
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
I played my opening song with seal amazing

543
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
And

544
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,720
To this day when I hear that song it's such a visceral memory of

545
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
This is going to work

546
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,144
Sadie Lincoln in just a moment

547
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728
How she took barre3 from a studio above Wild Oats

548
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
Two locations across the country

549
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
And in the process

550
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,640
Almost became someone she didn't want to be

551
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,248
I'm guy Raz stay with us you're listening to how I built this from NPR

552
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Support also comes from fidelity

553
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
As a Fidelity wealth

554
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

572
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Gyros

573
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
It's 2008 and at this point

574
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Saadia krisar

575
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Pretty busy running their studio in Portland

576
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,680
Let me spend so much time there that they actually have to hire a babysitter to be at the studio

577
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
So that their kids and their clients kids

578
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Can also come to the studio

579
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
I was a busy mom with two kids and I think the most important thing to both Chris and I as we wanted to have it come

580
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,808
We wanted a place where we could attract people that were inspirational

581
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Thoughtful

582
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Connected

583
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Exciting to be around it was just the two of us at the beginning and then one of my girls

584
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Friends who would move from the Bay Area

585
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
And she taught one or two classes

586
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
But I checked everybody in

587
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,288
Open the door as checked everybody and clean the bathroom let me know how things hot all 19

588
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Teen classes 6 a.m.

589
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Time to 8 p.m.

590
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
I was there

591
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
I knew every single client Maryellen I remember she was the first person to sign a membership she's still one of my clan

592
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
And if you were a drop in at that time how much do you have to

593
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Cepeda

594
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,720
$20 to wasn't it wasn't it was probably as around $5 more than yoga

595
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
How much runway did you

596
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
You have

597
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
Before this had to actually start make

598
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
I think

599
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
Our return was maybe in

600
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
16 months or so

601
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Is that pretty quick return

602
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,688
You know starting with 19 classes a week and having those classes have at least 10 to 12

603
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,504
People was our goal and that's exactly what we did

604
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
I mean you must have been stressed out

605
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,672
Even though you were doing 19 classes a week and you probably got a lot of your

606
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,792
Stressed out that way you still must have been stressed out 19 classes a week is not healthy

607
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
And if not

608
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
Yeah right

609
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
It is not

610
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
The chart of the story of my body

611
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Literally my back went out

612
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
And I remember my mom saying to me

613
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
Honey you're embodying

614
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:26,528
Because I was like walking around like a nine-year-old woman you know with my back slumped over like whining

615
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
Hurting and it was like

616
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Yeah

617
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Shoot

618
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
You know this

619
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Isn't good

620
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
So that was

621
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,840
A moment I was training instructors at the times I did have some relief

622
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
But I learned that

623
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
To be healthy

624
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,568
It really is okay to pause to not move cannot achieve and do not have an outward expression

625
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
I've what exercise means

626
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
You must have like

627
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
You know

628
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Pull out of this because you

629
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,088
You still managed to open up a second location pretty fast right

630
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
Pretty much right away I mean the first

631
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Year

632
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
We are open we put up a tab on our website

633
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
But that grow with us

634
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
And we got

635
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
Instant

636
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Interest

637
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Me and you liked by start your own barre3

638
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:23,360
An industry where we knew how to run multi-unit operation so going into barre3 we thought unilift open Maybe

639
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
20 of these

640
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,200
And that pacific northwest from the get-go you thought

641
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
Armada should be franchise

642
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,832
We have this unique knowledge and wisdom in the industry's so

643
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Instead of raising money

644
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
To open our own

645
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,768
Let's look into this franchise model which is really ultimately about empowering someone else

646
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Turn back

647
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:47,168
In this idea that we have in our wisdom and open up their own business pension to instead of going to

648
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Venture capitalist

649
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Thanks or whatever

650
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Yeah you didn't have to

651
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
At 1:10 we don't want to be beholden

652
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
To institutional money

653
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Instead I was really excited about still am excited about the idea of being the Holden and two other people just like me

654
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:08,160
Who had a dream and wanted to open their own business and have their own skin in the game

655
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
And

656
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Be able to make it their own

657
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
So where was it the second location

658
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Our first

659
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Two partners design

660
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Wer

661
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
The Philippines

662
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
In Manila

663
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
And Bend Oregon

664
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,312
Wow should you franchise immediately to

665
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Manila

666
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Yeah

667
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,944
This woman came in her name's Tanya town and she was in the states

668
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
And discovered ice and her family is very entrepreneurial

669
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:40,928
Are they have a family business and then their children each have different business models and she's the youngest of all the children and she

670
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
And because you and Chris had this

671
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Experience at 24 Hour Fitness

672
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
Franchising you understood how to structure

673
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Idet

674
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
I was weird we are bullish that way and

675
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,288
I mean it was exciting it was an adventure but we knew we could do it we knew we could do it internationally

676
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
With the right

677
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,968
And then Darcy and bend was close enough and she was coming to class and really a part of our tribe

678
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
Shortly after that was Carrie who opened in Vancouver Washington which is

679
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
220 minutes away

680
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
So most of our franchise Partners were

681
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Or our clan

682
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
So they

683
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Came to barre3

684
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Loved by three

685
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
New barre3 where owner Opera

686
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
So

687
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
Unlike some franchises are franchises owner-operated so if you're going to franchise I thought you're really going to live and breathe the product are going to teach

688
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Action management

689
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
And I'll be the face of it

690
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
It's interesting cuz we had Jerry Murrell on the show the founder of Five Guys

691
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
And which is like

692
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
The fastest growing

693
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:41,600
Very different business from yours Burgers and Fries

694
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
But you never

695
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
And

696
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,536
He was supposed to it like all of his sons part of the you know of the Five Guys

697
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
They like to do this

698
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
And he really didn't want to do it because

699
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
To him

700
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,984
It's a burger that they were serving in the fries at they were serving was

701
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
It was great to keep control the quality

702
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,360
You just completely opposed the idea obviously

703
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
Slickdeals differently today

704
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
Two weren't you nervous about handing over

705
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Your concept is somebody who could

706
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Like

707
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Screwed up

708
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,672
No I I think that's one thing about I have unbridled optimism in people

709
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,512
Sometimes to a fault to be honest but I really do believe in people

710
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
And here's the thing we don't

711
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Our product isn't a burger

712
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
It's a person

713
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
It's someone

714
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Teaching

715
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
A class

716
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
And

717
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
I cannot pretend to be able to control that

718
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
Because I can't control other people nor do I want to

719
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
But how did you

720
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
I mean there's no way

721
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,320
Is a creative person in this concept that you spent

722
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Gill years on

723
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Honing

724
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
There's no way

725
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
That you just hand it over and said go run with it like

726
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
You have to get there mentally I have to assume

727
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
Well it's person by person

728
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
You know we would meet with these people

729
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
And see if there was a deep connection

730
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
I believed in our training program

731
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
I believe in my ability my Master's is in education

732
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
I love training and develop

733
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
And that's what I wanted to bring to Fitness is this idea

734
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,504
Teaching and a true teacher at the teachers that I left the most going back to

735
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Santa Monica City College

736
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
And the teachers who really

737
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Brighten Academy

738
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
It wasn't that they were all knowing

739
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
And that they had the answers

740
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
They spark something inside of me

741
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
That made me realize I have the answer

742
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
And

743
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
I love doing that with body

744
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
I love doing that

745
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
I like showing people that

746
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
You can

747
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
First of all run your own Studio

748
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
And you can do it your own way here is our blueprint

749
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
But you

750
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Now get to go

751
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,248
But your own fingerprint on it

752
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,832
Because I do not want you to copy this is not the Sadie Lincoln

753
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
I am not a guru where the anti Guru

754
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
And

755
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Your true power

756
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,584
All of my owners is is in Collective with them just like I was raised

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
We did I mean I think the biggest problem with this emoji

763
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
It's scary and it's

764
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
And

765
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Does first Partners take a big wreck

766
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696

And it's for the long-term

775
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104

Expanding

789
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
Exploding in growth

790
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
I mean

791
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
At what point

792
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Did you just

793
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Did you impress you say

794
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,968
This is crazy I mean it must have been like a hamster wheel that just never stopped

795
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Going

796
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
Yeah I mean right in the middle there I kind of lost my

797
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,672
We are booming we're being acknowledged as like

798
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
We're getting great press

799
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
You know we really

800
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Hit means

801
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Stream

802
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,888
It went from this really insular like

803
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Word of Mouth

804
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Table

805
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Kind of secret

806
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Stage

807
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
And

808
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
Worldstage really

809
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,896
And I was at the center of that so that was

810
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Kind of crazy I got lost

811
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,016
A little bit just being a public figure

812
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
In a way yeah

813
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
And I started to fall in

814
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
2

815
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Marketing machine

816
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Which I had

817
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
Laughed when we moved to Portland weed

818
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
Excitedly shut out all traditional marketing

819
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
And a weighted like a

820
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
Express ourselves we don't even like

821
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Tetanus

822
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
I'm in an office and I kind of got back into that machine

823
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Shein

824
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
And I was in Publications

825
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Was working with

826
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,968
The producer in LA and everybody was telling me that

827
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
This way

828
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Talking about Fitness this is the way you

829
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
Speak about what you're doing come to you sing Sadie we can turn you on

830
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Jane Fonda

831
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,816
UNF you go to the website and you still are the face of it and then videos of you and

832
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
But you don't Embrace that

833
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:47,520
Well I did want it because the idea of growing and serving the company that way was really it's

834
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Exciting to me and to be able to get that kind of attention and

835
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Interpol our business was super exciting

836
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
I meant really helps

837
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,248
Soulfully though it went against

838
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
My

839
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
Intuition about not being a guru

840
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,160
And I don't want to see the messages that are already

841
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,512
So loud we've got the message is loud and clear everywhere yes

842
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
If you work out

843
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Can you do these things are going to look like that

844
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
And

845
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
I was getting trained by

846
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Produces and stuff

847
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
To say thanks

848
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
While you're working out your always have

849
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,056
How to say you're working out this muscle so you can have a thinner waist for bikini season

850
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
You're doing this so that you can have this

851
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
You know it sells like hotcakes

852
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
This is the way you're supposed to do it

853
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
I tried it on

854
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Precise they also said

855
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Get hair and makeup

856
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
You don't get a stylus

857
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
So I did all that so we have online workout

858
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,672
And I just little era of online workouts

859
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
Were you can see where I did this to us we've pulled some of them but

860
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
I hired a makeup person

861
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
I started to be more

862
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,936
About what I wore on camera and then I started

863
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
Speak in a different language that was more like quote-unquote results-oriented

864
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,104
And under the videos the people who are commenting

865
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
They were checked

866
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
My clan

867
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
People who are part of my movement

868
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
We're checking me out the door

869
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
They were saying

870
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
Honey you don't need to wear all that bronzer your beautiful as you are

871
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,464
And you know what you don't need to tell me to get teeny tiny arms

872
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
Like I'm doing this cuz I want to be

873
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
I'm sure there are people who are Saints

874
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632

875
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,472
Next million-dollar company xxxx

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,360
And then you can do that and you can become like Jillian Michaels are like another

877
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
You know

878
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Jane Fonda

879
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,248
10% by the way I respect all this

880
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
For all these Incredibles

881
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
People in my space

882
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112

883
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Incredible women

884
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
And I think

885
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
We all

886
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Want the same thing

887
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
In terms of

888
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Growing bigger

889
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
I'm actually not focus on growing bigger any

890
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
We pause

891
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Franchising

892
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
For now

893
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
We're just holding

894
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,496
Being still and we're being uncomfortable and still

895
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
Being still is uncomfortable to bury a neurologist

896
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
10 class and we're still

897
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,128
In closet when you try to meditate I don't know

898
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
If you ever have

899
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
Yes I'm comfortable if I do everyday and

900
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,064
It's hard it's hard to be still because it's a real like intermere thing

901
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
You have to check in and see things

902
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
So if you look at a company as a person

903
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
We've decided Lee

904
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Decided to meditate

905
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Easter

906
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
What was the reasoning to do something

907
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
What happened or did you impressive

908
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
Just put some pod

909
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Why I mean in any

910
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,080
Other business people would say we're growing withdrawal it's growing program

911
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Which is exciting

912
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,920
What we was trying to be courted by a lot of inside

913
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Anchors

914
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Pure Barre was sold for 100

915
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
21 million dollars

916
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
A bar

917
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,416
Champion Powerhouse

918
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:50,816
Right and like the story we kept hearing this who's going to be number two who can be number two and you could be valued at gazillion dollar

919
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
Where is and

920
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
So we started entertain a bunch of

921
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Conversation

922
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
You could have just cashed out

923
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Like majorly

924
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah

925
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,824
There's lots of choice out there right and

926
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
Kind of feel like

927
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
I want to be a bit of a rebel

928
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
So I am

929
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Right now others

930
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,904
CEOs other Founders other people in this world who are going at it alone

931
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
So I just want to protect

932
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
But I had

933
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Versus

934
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Make it Giant

935
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
And I want to show

936
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
Business community

937
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Do it that way

938
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
There's not that many

939
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
People saying that in the business community

940
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
You know the value of not

941
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Growing

942
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
The value of not

943
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Sign

944
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
You know it's interesting because there's is kind of Drive

945
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
An intern segments of the business world to do that

946
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
What are plenty of companies including

947
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,416
Episodes in the show with you with with with Angie's List

948
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Companies that are not

949
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Profitable but they're sustainable

950
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
They are

951
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
More like breaking even if every year

952
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
That has enabled them to hire

953
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,240
You're more than a thousand people and in their lots of companies at

954
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,336
Aren't as focused on profit but our focus on sustainability and just

955
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Creating jobs

956
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Syncreon careers for

957
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
4 people

958
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
So it doesn't

959
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
Have to be about growth and expansion and growth and expansion

960
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
That's right

961
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,624
That's really what I love about my product is that

962
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
We literally embody ideas and barre3

963
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
So we're teaching exercise but wearing body and

964
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
Stay with me for a second I know this is strange.

965
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
But I think what you just said is so analogous

966
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Chuze Fitness

967
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
You can do a 30-day

968
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Extreme programming

969
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
With your body

970
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
You know

971
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Exercise

972
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
Every single day

973
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Eat nothing White

974
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
You know drink tons of water

975
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,456
Get 10 hours of sleep every single day

976
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
You know lift lots of weight

977
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
And get tremendous results

978
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Dislike

979
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Exciting

980
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,416
Write a tremendous like change in your body

981
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,976
Is that sustainable

982
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,328
To exercise every single day until to be. Regimented and disciplined

983
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Not from us

984
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
It's a short-term

985
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
And that is the story were sold over and over again

986
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
The story which is listen tok

987
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,664
Cicada know a lot of people but over time I think they really get it is this

988
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Sustainability model

989
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
Exercising

990
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
10 minutes a day

991
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
Being in touch with the food you're eating

992
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
You know that it's okay to drink a glass

993
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,184
Relationships are just as healthy as X

994
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,560
And that developing a long-term relationship with exercise that's

995
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,608
Sustainable is actually

996
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
Going to benefit your posture you'll live longer

997
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,240
I'm feel better in your skin

998
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
Yeah you won't shed weight in 30 days Nessa

999
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
The Sara Lee but in the long-term you will

1000
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Listening

1001
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
I've been meaning to ask you about which is

1002
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:55,392
We had like Melissa & Doug on the show who came up with Melissa & Doug toys for kids and

1003
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:01,792
Incredible Partnerships the married and they are they built these incredible businesses

1004
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Together

1005
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
But then you know I've talked to other entrepreneurs to say there's no way I could work with my partner there's just no way I mean might might might

1006
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
The person who I have a family with like that we would just

1007
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Kill each other

1008
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
You and Chris have built

1009
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
A business together

1010
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Is it just

1011
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
Your personalities mesh and you

1012
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,064
Naturally find your way or is there ever any tension or

1013
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Yeah I mean

1014
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
There's no way

1015
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,488
I'm sure there's a way by can't imagine a way of not working

1016
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Yesterday

1017
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Saul start

1018
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,680
We're different and that he's really analytical and his

1019
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Those are different

1020
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,568
A very thoughtful he doesn't talk very much he thinks about things for a long long long time

1021
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,128
Whereas I just got in the sting

1022
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Yeah we're both starters

1023
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,760
We're both entrepreneur all we both are

1024
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Really into our children

1025
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
And our dogs

1026
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
I have my best

1027
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Friend

1028
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
By my side my rock

1029
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
He's the one that gives me courage

1030
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
To be

1031
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
And to make crazy decisions

1032
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
And so it just works for us

1033
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
Are you always talking about the bass

1034
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
We talked about it a lot

1035
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
Like we talked about the business more than we do our kids

1036
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
We are joking we're talking about how

1037
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
How many businesses

1038
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
Decisions have been made in bed

1039
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
But then we are laughing about how funny that sounds

1040
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,088
Because it was nothing about that sexy it's like Carol and Mike Brady

1041
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Like

1042
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
That's why we are in bed

1043
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
We are laptops

1044
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
What color should it be orange okay

1045
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,072
What's your name be part 3 sounds great

1046
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
But it's kind of beautiful to

1047
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
How much of

1048
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
I asked

1049
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
Too much everybody's feeling show about

1050
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
This question was just how much of what happened

1051
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
To you guys

1052
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Acid with locking how much

1053
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
Evan has to do with your skill

1054
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
An inability

1055
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Oh God

1056
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
I think

1057
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Timing was great for us

1058
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
This Boutique movement started and

1059
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
People wanting connection and community

1060
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,303
I was I'm a teacher and group exercise became hot again

1061
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,375
I'm moving to Portland and just the right moment

1062
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
Being shut out from all the noise so we weren't

1063
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,495
Competing with anyone we can just do it exactly what we need

1064
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
Scratch around Edge

1065
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,591
So that's like anyway but the movement you know

1066
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
At the right time

1067
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,199
But a lot of hard work and enter work and

1068
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
Paying our dues out there in the business world

1069
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,039
Certainly was a part of

1070
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
I think probably like most business is a combination of all the factors

1071
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
Sadie Lincoln

1072
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
Founder of barre3

1073
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,631
By the way if her childhood story sounded somewhat familiar

1074
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,727
It's probably because you heard her brother Miguel's version

1075
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,799
Previous episode of the show he's Miguel McKelvey

1076
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,127
Founder of the multi-billion-dollar company we work

1077
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,223
Miguel also grew up in that all women's Collective

1078
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
And like his sister Sadie

1079
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,343
He also rebelled against it by going into business

1080
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Was it better than Miguel

1081
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
Hahaha

1082
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
So much better

1083
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,839
But I will say I was really excited because my high school

1084
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
Took me over him for the holiday

1085
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Oh that's good

1086
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
San Miguel

1087
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
That's Heavy kids you know

1088
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:37,087
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things

1089
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Your building

1090
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,183
The first a quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

As of just 13 and a half hours of battery life

1094
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,703
8th gen Intel Core processor

1095
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
You can work for as long as you want to

1096
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Wherever work takes

1097
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
Hey thanks for sticking around because

It's time now for how you built that

1099
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,039
And today we're going to the story about Alexander

1100
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
That we first ran last year Alexander grew up in New York City and what Anna sisters would sit down for me

1101
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,791
It was always one thing one condiment that they

00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
Watch slathered on everything put it on baked potatoes all the time we would have it in you

00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Yogurts we have it on chicken

1104
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
I'm bagels and cream cheese on eggs on Burgers sandwich

1105
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527

00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
Tangy earthy Middle Eastern Spice made with different types of time maybe some oregano

1109
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
Other spices like Acumen Sage some sesame seeds even chickpeas

1110
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
I mean it is a cultural food stable and you're asking Middle Eastern person do you know exact are is it's like a

1111
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
Askanamerican do you know what apple pie is

1112
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
Anyway a few years ago Alexander who happens to be of Lebanese descent started to notice is that Harwood show

1113
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,295
Going up in all of these unexpected places like

1114
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
Is Corner hipster restaurants on Instagram on social media as I can

1115
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
No way is that are becoming a thing yes in some parts of the country is itar was becoming

1116
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
Nothing but Alexander wondered why nobody made it the way his mom did mixing the spices with all

1117
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,079
Olive oil into a spread it brings out the flavor

1118
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,407
Of the herbs you know the essence of the herbs out more

1119
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
And you know the condiments are cool everybody loves condiments right so I was thinking about all of this last year

1120
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:50,207
And at the same time he was working at a research firm on Wall Street the job he wasn't really crazy about

1121
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,607
Until one night he was having dinner at his parents place. Car was of course on the table and

1122
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,679
Looking down my head between my arms telling them what's going on

1123
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,751
And boom it just hit me I'm staring at

1124
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
And I said I got it it's his a lightbulb moment Alexander says we have got to

1125
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,551
To make za'atar the way you making mom and we should sell it like as a spread eating these foods are whole life

1126
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,951
A joke about it we should have started hummus or we should have started the Greek yogurt so let's do it

1127
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,023
Pokemon Slater Alexander walked away from his job

1128
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:31,423
He moved back in with his parents he found an industrial kitchen Googled where to find the spices the

1129
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
Olive oil is a little glass jars he made his first batch of spreadable za'atar and he started going

1130
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,223
Door-to-door to sell it to specialty stores in New York I have these little gift bags at a jar zesty Z cheated

1131
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
Chips recipe cards in our sales sheet can I walk in and I'd say hey I think I've got a great product to customers would like

1132
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,719
And I'll follow up with you and when he did follow up in a week

1133
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
A lot of people said no no we don't like this we don't think this will sell we don't like the taste setter

1134
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:07,007
Cetera dealing with that you know people who say that it's business not personal

1135
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:13,407
Whoever came up with that quote or says that you never started a business because I would disagree with that for sure

1136
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,807
But a few months after he got all those knows I got an email saying thank you so much for the thoughtful pack

1137
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
We absolutely love this will take two cases

1138
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:29,023
And when I got that email starts crying that email was from one specialty store in Brooklyn

1139
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,863
And from there Alexander started to get a bit more traction

1140
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,447
Even got a sucker spread into a few Whole Foods in New York City

1141
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
And now a year after we first ran the story does that tire spread is in 450

50 Whole Foods Markets across the country and Alex is planning to roll out for new products next year

1143
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,647

1144
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
What I ate growing up with everybody else

1145
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
