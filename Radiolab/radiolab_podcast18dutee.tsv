EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There was no track to run on so I would run along the edge of the river or
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	On the road
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or in the village

EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And the tiny pebbles in the road would get stuck in my feet
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:39,488	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	My sister pushed me

EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	2014
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Was preparing for the Commonwealth Games

EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Preparing for the games
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She gets sent to the team doctors for doping test
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And she said like this was kind of a normal part of her life
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Blood test
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I had blood test done ever since I was little
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We did take a dope test
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A month before every tournament
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Also after the race
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So she goes to see the team doctor
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And he's like
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	No blood we're going to do an ultrasound
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is not normal
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so she asked them
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Why
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And they just said oh we're like looking at your bone density and so she's like okay whatever
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Eventually she does do a normal blood test
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Goes back
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Keep straining to the games
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Couple of weeks later picks up the newspaper and sees her picture on the front page of the newspaper
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There's a picture of me with a huge headline screaming

EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She has no idea what's going on but you said at that point her phone starts
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Blowing up
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The media called me and told me all the details like there was this gender test that have
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Saying is it true is it true you failed a gender test

EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Didn't understand how this could happen
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And the media kept asking me what are you actually
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I said
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I don't know my parents gave birth to me and I grew up the way that they raced me the Mello Kings I'm a girl
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Woman and I didn't know about anything that was being reported about me
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You feel the gender test

EDL	00:06:59,327	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Exactly
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I I didn't add that.
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duty thing it was the first time I'd ever heard that phrase but it's
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Actually the thing that's been happening in sports for a long time
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I'm going to take you on a journey back to the beginning of it
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So I didn't know this but the but the sort of first modern
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Olympics of 1896
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Simsbury Center
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There are no female ass
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And apparently like the one of the people who is
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Charger assertive like restarting the Olympic set something like this
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Like no place for women
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Sure nuff by 1900 decided to allow women
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Meet the Press time
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You had
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	22 female athletes
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which pills works best for athletic competition could physically damage the week of
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Was not uncontroversial
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	By the 19 by 1960 summer games of the 17th Olympia
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which were the Olympics in Rome there are 600 female athlete
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:11,263	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so two things complete at the same time which is a lot of women now participating in the Olympics
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And the Cold War
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know the Soviet Union and the US
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A lot of posturing there and there was this Psych
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Fear
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Not very merited it
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,855	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It turns out that
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Maybe the Soviets were
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Taking men
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And putting them into
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Female athletic
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	To win more medals
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or that the US was doing that also
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so what started
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Were these things that everyone calls
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The nude parade
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What is that
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So women
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Would line up wearing bras and panties
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And they would go in front of
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Three doctors
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Cement
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I had to lower their underpants
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And are you serious
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Yes and they were examined palpated and measured
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This makes me very uncomfortable
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Sewing base so invasive invasive is the first word that comes to mind
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So this is happening all throughout the 60
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	People start to complain
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Brightly and the
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,919	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Iaaf
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is the International Association of Athletics
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Confederations and the international Olympic Committee
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Both come under criticism
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Anto
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In the late 19th
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They come up with another approach
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Another
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Okay and that's a chromosome
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Body test
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Spell scrape from the inside of the cheek
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A place under microscope
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And then tested for x's and y's
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Dog spot showed up only on female test anybody who has
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	XX
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is okay cuz that supposedly goes female and anybody with something other than XX
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	If they find a y chromosome in there that means you your mail theoretically less invasive
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I have to pull down their underwear
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And way more precise the idea
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	At that point was
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Will Ohio see a 1968 said that the chromosome test
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Quote indicates quite definitively the sex of a person
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Except
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	When it does
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Like we talked about in our last episode there is a gene on the Y chromosome that if you have it and if it turns on you will
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Likely become a male
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There are a lot of XY women
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In the world
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	These are women who had a y chromosome which is associated with male but that little Jean it didn't turn on
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Converse so you can have XX males meaning that little piece of a y chromosome got onto an ex
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There are all of these different chromosomal like aberrations youku
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Xxxx
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You have two extra access when you can have three extra taxes
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	As a woman
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	As a female yeah
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You could be xxy xyy Easter perfectly healthy people
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It runs the gamut you could have
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Are fertility issues or developmental issues or were or no issues at all and tow the debate was
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know there are a lot of
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Geneticist
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	An endocrinologist who are saying
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Sex
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Isn't determined just
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Buy chromosomes
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Determined by hormones and by physiology and
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,671	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Totally getting away from gender which is even more complicated but
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Just because you
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Don't have access
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Doesn't mean that you are
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A woman
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And eventually all of the Sport's governing bodies
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Came around to that conclusion and by 2000 everybody was like no more chromosome testing
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In fact the World Federation that governs track and field has voted to scrap all testing for gender
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This moment where
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It looks like gender testing is going to go away
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Cold War is Over those fears
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,111	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Zircon
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Maybe we didn't need it anymore
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But then this
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Other idea walked into the room that
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Actually been there all along
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This idea of
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Fairness
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Because the fact of the matter is
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	If you compare male athletes to female athletes
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Pretty much every track and field event except for a few
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is a big difference in performance
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Like take the 800m
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Soccer World Record women's record is 1 minute 53-28
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Where is the men's World Record
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Alarm 1:00
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Almost 13 seconds fast
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In fact I talk to HR some background to one female athletes
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	World champion one of us women in the world and she said
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Her fastest mile is regularly beaten by like a good high school boy
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I'm so if you're a female athlete
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or even like a spectator who's watching the sport you want to make sure that females and males aren't race
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,207	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Other
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so what you saw
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	When this sort of like organized gender testing went away
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is that whenever someone that runs really fast
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There's finger-pointing
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And it's all came to a head in 2009
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So that we go down to Trackside off all that excitement as the women try and gather themselves called the 808 is fine
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	On August 19th of that year a South African runner just 18 caster semenya
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Virginia weather
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Just crushes
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Chesterfield
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	On the final lap she wins by
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is soma
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What is the wealthiest
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What am I to seconds
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And almost immediately after the race
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	My conclusion was
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Something
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Something's going on here there's something not right
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There was just a thought that there was a problem oh yeah yeah
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This is Madeline Payton the PHD candidate in sociology and an Olympian for Australia she ran against
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Semenya in that heat
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is she since become a big defender of Pastor but she says that the time
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Because the menus times recruiting
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So quickly because she was kicking the field ass like so totally
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	People around me with talking about heaven
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Spinning room is it spreading what were the people around you saying is she a man
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She just looks like a man
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,343	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Cuz she's a tomboy
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It wasn't that I was like
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I didn't hold a strong opinion about it I just
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,231	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Like I just want the audible I have to
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	To do with it and make it go away
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so you had gotten to the point where you were opposed to Castor compito I was opposed to cast a competing
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Almost immediately
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,263	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In Berlin
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Over the next 24 hours she says the rumors got louder and louder basically like a
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Cacophonous
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Level in Berlin last night but the drama had to do less with who won the race then who was
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:28,255	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And whether they should have been happening in the media is whether one of the runners should be
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In the men's or women's race
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is she in the new world champion of the women's 800-meter race
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That's when
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The iwf
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Passports
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Governing body
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The autoclave claimed that they had no
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Choice but to announce something at that point
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,247	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But yes
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They were going to investigate caster semenya
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,415	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Because they had concerns about her sexual development
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Effigy
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Investigation
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Proven
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Physically
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	He's not a female
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Daily Beast
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	He'll name
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	4D result
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Beijing today
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It was one of those things I think with us
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Looking back I feel like
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It makes me sad
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Yeah it really makes me sad
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,175	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What ended up happening to caster semenya
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Wells ijas banter there all these closed-door meetings in Xi'an Tracy like a year
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What the audible app
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Testing
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Reveals about semenya is physiological makeup never has been confirmed actually
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Emerge from all the mishegoss is that
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In the end iaaf
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,143	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Recommitted to gender
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:42,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Trying to figure out some
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Clearbright measurable
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Way

EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This means we need to be clear about the company

EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But those two cats
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And the way they decided now to
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:07,071	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Clear was no longer about chromosomes
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	No more medieval nude parade in

EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They were going to look at hormone
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Specifically
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Testosterone
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Either naturally occurring
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or artificially inserted into the body
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Provides
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Significant
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Performance
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Advantage
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I think there is little
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The idea was
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We know that testosterone causes muscles that are like faster stronger leaner
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And that men have 10 to 30 times more testosterone in women
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,351	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is a byproduct of having testes
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Enter the concern was in these women the
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Have that
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Why Jean
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Either that they might have
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The internal testes that having descended or like a ganado streak like some reproductive tissue that would be
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Emitting testosterone giving them some sort of mail like advantage
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,367	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Antonio in 2011 the
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The iaaf
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Besides that
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They will institute a test for eye test
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Gastrin levels
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And so if the testosterone levels Falls
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	With within quote the mail range
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Then there to be barred
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And this is the first time I try and put a number on it they say that you're
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Testosterone levels if they're greater than 10 animals
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Our leader
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You cannot run animals

EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Basically this is b*******
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	My family and my friends and my fans kept saying to me
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You must be the victim of some kind of politics
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You were running so well and that's why someone's trying to stop you
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She gets her own doctor and she does the test again
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	OSHA test results in this test we're the same
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Started to believe that there was something wrong with my body
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She told me that
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Tried

EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Scared cuz I didn't know anything about it
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She said I felt naked
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I'm a human being but I felt like I was an animal
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:13,248	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In our village
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:22,464	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Children are born at home and no one goes to the hospital to deliver baby
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Had I been born at the hospital maybe the doctor would have said what was going on inside my body and I would have probably understood
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Did this better as a child
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Animatic
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Cuz I wasn't the case I was born at home and raised like a girl and there were no issues surrounding the
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	When suddenly the question was raised about my gender calling me a male
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is very confusing
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	How could I have just become a man one day
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Ultimately
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,888	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duty decides I'm going to fight
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Andrew says she sends a letter appealing herb and the Athletics
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Federation of India
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She writes
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I was born a woman
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Reared up as a woman
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I identify as a woman
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I believe I should be allowed to compete with other women
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Many of whom are either taller than me
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or come from more privileged background
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Things that most certainly give them an edge over me
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And eventually Duty ends up at the court of arbitration for sport
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is that a
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Higher body than the IA
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	AF it's like the it's like the Supreme Court

EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,112	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duties essentially making two main arguments
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The first is that the hyperandrogenism rule is
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Discriminatory
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Discriminatory towards women
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Twitch the iaaf essentially says
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Yeah kind of is
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We're doing it for a reason
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And that reason outweighs
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The risk
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Definitely there's definitely an argument that if you eradicated gender
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You would be screwing over hundreds of thousands of women
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They're sort of
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Their big thing is like listen
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	As a society
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Even in this court case we all seem to agree we want to separate men and women
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We need to figure out some way to do this
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duties response to that
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Her second argument is sure okay fine we need to separate the Sexes but
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The way you chosen to do it is not solid you have this number 10 animals for leader which is supposedly the high
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	High-end of testosterone for women
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But if you actually look at the data
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They're crazy variability like you will see women with levels that were like
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Less than one
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And levels that were Bus 30
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is typically considered 30 like considered high for men
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So there was this
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Dick the studies that came out where one study was like
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We've we look at all these different testosterone levels and
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know there's an average for men in there's an average for women and they're on different ends of the spectrum but we saw is
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There's totally overlap
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It's not like one and the other at never the two shall meet that like there's
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That that some women go high and some and go low
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And you've got
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know men with low testosterone who are world-class Champions and you've got women with high testosterone that never win
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It's just it's not always
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Clear the role that testosterone has in performance
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Oh really I thought it was I thought that was well-established today the testosterone will make
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Faster likes and then what steroids do there is agreement that synthetic testosterone
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Steroids
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Ramsa performance
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Helping both male and female athletes jump higher
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And run faster
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But there's
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Vehement disagreement about whether natural
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,552	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Osterone one's own test
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That same effect
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Why why wouldn't it
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Well that's a really good question
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Idle AF Witnesses
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Argue
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely to work the way since
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Testosterone does
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Some scientists argue that a sudden burst of testosterone is much different than sort
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A natural level of testosterone that your body is calibrated to
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The long and the short
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The science is surprisingly can test
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,320	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Furthermore Duty argued
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,624	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	If you really want to talk about fairness
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You need to look Beyond sex
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They're all sorts of advantages that
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	People have you know some people are born with
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:47,936	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Increased aerobic capacity and others with resistance to fatigue or super long limbs or
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,472	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Flexible joints
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Large hands and feet
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:55,616	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And other people have disadvantages like Duty said I came from a village and in
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Southeast India
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Where I raced for years with no shoes
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And only had
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Vegetables and rice
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You know like if you want things to be fair
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Then like we should all have the exact same
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The exact same coaching sis
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The exact same shoes
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But the idle AF say well that sound about
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The division between men and women If Sports is / men and women we need to find out what the thing is
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Divide 9 Lima
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	July
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Two thousand
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The court of arbitration for sport rule today
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That dutee Chand
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Could continue to race the spider higher-than-normal levels of testosterone
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Court rules that Duty can continue to race
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And they say to the I was like you don't have enough scientific evidence
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	To have is hyperandrogenism
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Go where found that
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Let us know what you find
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:56,288	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Descent through this whole controversy at least a year goes by Duty never stops running
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	If my Coach told me no matter what just keep training
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Define puzzled I wake up at 5 a.m. train from 6 to 10
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Hit the ground again from 4 to 6
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Picks for the 3rd round
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Training with the coach
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And the summer after the ruling at a big International meet in Kazakhstan
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duty ran 11.3 in the hundred
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Setting an Indian National Record
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	She makes the Olympics
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Becoming the first-ever Indian woman to qualify for the Rio Olympics in the hundred
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Since 1980
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Meanwhile the iaaf
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,744	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I just like the court asked
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,792	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Go back to the drawing board
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And they commissioned their own study
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And last summer it was published
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What they did was analyzed blood samples from a couple thousand
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:06,688	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Athletes at the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and what they were looking for was to see if the women
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	With high testosterone outperforms the women with low testosterone
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And what they found is that if you are a female Runner
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Who runs the 400m and 800m the 400 hurdles
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	By the mile
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	You
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:27,936	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Are conferred an advantage with high testosterone levels
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In only those events and only those event
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There's also a throwing event
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And one other
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Having high testosterone levels
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Conferred an advantage of like 1.8
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Percent and a half percent
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Faster
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or like 2% to 4% rough
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,464	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And just to say like if you're a runner
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,024	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	1%
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Could be like two tenths of a second
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:56,608	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	110
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is which is off and how races are decided
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:06,336	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And these studies these distances are the higher distances these distances the middle.
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Middle-distance
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,128	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:12,480	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Sprint not not the Sprints and not the long with their study finds is that the Sprints
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Do not you do not get an advantage from testosterone the long-distance
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	No Advantage from testosterone
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Deez middle distant races
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Seemingly an advantage from testosterone and
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,280	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A throwing event
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,328	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Would a hammer throw
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	What a f****** mess
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We started with like the nude parade and now where we end up with at the line that we've chosen to draw is
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Hinze's
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Middle distance races
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,224	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That's where we're going to like make a big deal about
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Trying to separate out the sex
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It feels like yes it feels like everyone's just arguing over change at this point
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Even since that study was published
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The data has been called into question and there's a call for retraction and they published there's a bunch of
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Data errors
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The author still stand behind the study and in fact I double AF is now using it as the basis for a new test
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Classroom rules
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	They introduced
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	This past April
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We reach out to the I was a few times and didn't hear back
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I mean right now we're arguing about test
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,576	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Testosterone but I think it's a bigger issue here is that
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We're like
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Coming into a moment as Society
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Where were more and more open to gender fluidity
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But if we all agreed on a whole
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	That that
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It's that it's unfair to group
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Women with men in
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Sports
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Then we do have to answer a real question
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Which is how do I keep

EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	At the place where these two worlds meet
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Hard place to find yourself

EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Duty told me when this whole thing blew up

EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Is boys and girls are falling for each other and there was a
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The guy who fell hard for me and
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I fell for him too
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	We used to talk a lot on the phone and
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Thought that one day when we got older we get married
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Peking duck
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	1114 Mason
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:34,304	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But when the news in 2014 started appearing everywhere
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	He started asking me who I was for real
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,144	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But I do like that
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	He said if you're a boy then how can the two of us
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Both boys
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Stay together in the future how will our dreams of having children or creating a family ever come true
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,248	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Eventually I did tell him that
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	The results confirmed that I had hyperandrogenism
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And I asked him
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Are you going to love me and marry me
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Or not
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	He said
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Name app
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I don't love you anymore and I can't marry you because my family doesn't approve of our relationship
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So I said fine
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	So he forgot me and I forgot him too
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	After that guy left me there haven't been any other guys that like me anymore
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	A lot of girls have started like
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Liking me
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,952	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	And a lot of them say that they want to settle down with me
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	How do you feel about that
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Guess the logo
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I guess I feel happy and sad
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Images of my childhood dreams of having a husband creating a family with him might not come true
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I want to see all these girls still attracted to me
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	I often wonder
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,480	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	If I could make a home with a girl
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	In India only boys and girls get married girls don't marry girls
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	It was more acceptable to marry girl in India do you think you'd want to do that
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Happy Thanksgiving
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:14,912	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Right now I haven't thought about it and I'm focusing on my sports career
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:19,520	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	After I'm done with my career I am going to need someone to spend my life with
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,544	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	Birthright
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	There is any guy that likes me I would marry him and settle down
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:32,832	| radiolab_podcast18dutee |	But if there are any guys interested in me and girls still like me then I would settle down with a girl
