EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Curator
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Guide Maybe
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	How about DJ Ave.
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Oh really
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	That's terrible it doesn't work at all
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Every moment every moment
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Explain like the show is just super different back then
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The idea of it back then was to just take all of these documentaries from around the world and smash them together
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	But would end up happening is it like I would line up three or four things
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And I would have liked a 20-minute hole
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Which I would start to experiment and that's
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Those spots were what the show grew out
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,583	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	What's up so that was in 2002 and then I met you the following spraying
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And then we are later the whole year later
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I know there's a year worth of that
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And by the time I met you back
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	In New York
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You were so sleep-deprived okay so we're a little bit and then we start talking
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	At the moment
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	When Robert got involved with someone I'll never
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So I was trying to fill one of those 20-minute holes I had done an interview with a memory research
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Picture
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And it was just one of those
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Science interviews. Now we're super familiar with we're like the scientist is using all this latinate words
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I couldn't figure out what she was saying but it's
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Still seemed interesting
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I just couldn't understand it and so Robert and Ellen and I had breakfast one day at kitchenette
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Foundation rest
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We go to for breakfast every week and we were sitting there and
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I was like I got this interview I don't know what to do with about memory and I
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Here's what I think she's saying I think she's saying something about how memories are never the same you're always constantly making them and then you just like
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Snapped into this

EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Suddenly you're playing this like all these characters
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Al and I were like oh my god let's just go into the studio and have him do that you want to hear a little
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Taste of the sort of curious what would this is this is one of the ones like we did the memory and forgetting at the podcast
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	But this is

EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Let's just take the situation we're in right now

EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And pull them together into this thing that you think is going on right now
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Please let me get this straight
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You're saying that
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	At this moment
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Yes and this one
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Antoine
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I hopelessly lost
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Some people say that you don't have to live in the moment this is the moment
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Fort
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It's a memory
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Everything
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Isn't it

EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You say it has already happened before it even had a chance to become this moment but let's say we want to remember it later
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	What do we do it's interesting what's going to happen
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Is you're going to
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Take
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The touch the sound of smelling everything that's in your brain from that moment with you all sitting lodged in different places
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You going to reassemble it pull it back
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,295	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Together again I use the interesting thing
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	20 minutes from now
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Really hungry
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Dim the licorice number the liquid part of the licorice part will somehow Loom a little larger be
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Because you want
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,351	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Itachi susanoo
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	How you're feeling in the moment that you're remembering has a lot to do with what you remember
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Let's just take a simpler phrase like
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Kapiel of water right
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	If you want to recollect that
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Praise
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	But suppose you just had a wonderful
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Sting
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Jill when you think of when you reassemble it
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It'll go
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Jack and Jill went up the hill
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Season see the Jill thing is so
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	That instead you just confirm extraordinary Haiku you have
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Gloriously, spectacular Hill
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Can I hear the thing when you reassemble this time
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You think
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Jack and Jill
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	What up
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	See the hell now the healing this has got all the MPN I got it so you're always remembering
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Differently each time depending upon this reminds me of
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We have any player this
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It's amazing to me that at such an early point
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The business of
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Deconstructing puzzles
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Switch I guess a lot of what we did
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Took on this very big
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Particular quality
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	This kind of
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Razzle Dazzle Of Anything could happen in the next second I don't know who's going to say the next thing
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	But there's something beautifully organic about it when it's done
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So today we're celebrating 15 years
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Of making Radiolab coming up after the break we're going to play the first thing they were podcast
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It's not something you can get on iTunes
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It fell off iTunes a long time ago
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Play the first
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,479	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	This is Lisa Kenny calling from San Diego
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Enhancing public understanding of science
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And technology in the modern world more information about Sloan at www.slha.org
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Brilliance
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:46,623	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It just means you bring back and say whoa
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	If you have a story with us
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio mess
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Ava back
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The first episode we were podcast literally the first but it was among the first few
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	With an episode about time
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I do remember
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Playing it to my wife
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,023	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I was always scared cuz she's a New York Times Reporter I thought I was to learn to like the company
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,815	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And she came out of the kitchen in
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I really like
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:04,703	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Call me if you feel like it
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Is one of the one of the early military like maybe this
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Are podcast
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	80 years ago
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Probably very few people have heard this
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You're listening to radio on New York Public Radio public radio WNYC
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You know this music trust me
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You heard it your entire life
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The reason you can't recognize it now
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Because the composer born 1770 intended for this moment the one you're hearing
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The last two seconds
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Like that
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	However have you been a whale
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Beethoven might have written his Ninth Symphony this way
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Changes that for us would take
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,759	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	An instant
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Transpire over minutes and a movement
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Eyeglass
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	6 hours
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	That's a fact what this is
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Beethoven's 9th Symphony digitally stretched from its normal 60 some-odd Minutes to last an entire
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,143	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Day 24 hours

EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Of course it's right however
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:08,000	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Instead of going into the tavern Hannigan at the exact same moment
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Deutsche bank building

EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Is it right though
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Yes it's right at that very same moment suppose instead of going to the top of the bank
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	He gone to the hotel
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,664	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Can I help you or you tell me the time

EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Trophy Tavern
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	33 past the hour at the hotel 19 pass the bank 3 pass what time
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Is it really
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	In Sandusky at the question the answer is
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	There was no official time in sendai
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	What do you mean there's no official time and said there wasn't any known 1850
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The government didn't have a Time
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Celina Ohio in the 1850s you'd have as many times
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	As it were clocks in the town
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,992	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So there was no reason
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You think about it to synchronize it if you're clocking like what 4 minutes or 10 minutes different in Sandusky and 1850s
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Who cares
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Until
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The railroad changed every
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Once the Wheel Road King is open while to take
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I don't know
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	How about the 303 to
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Okay
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	If you want to take the field. How would he know when it was 303 I see where you're going with that if you went by the Banks
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Need a ride
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	A half hour ahead of time
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Can you buy the hotel clock
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:46,816	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Chalk for the sake of their business really real roads created railroad time and again putting up clocks are there
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Makes sense and because the railroads were so important
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:53,216	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The Tavern we have to get its beer deliveries from where
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The banks would have to get their cash from the railroad in the hotel
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Real-time becomes everybody
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So what happened to local
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Will local time disappeared
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Really yeah it local time means that when it's noon in Sandusky the sun is directly over your head
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	By 1880
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,536	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	That wasn't true anymore
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The real Road
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,120	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Head instructed Sandusky that from now on
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It's noon would be 20 minutes later
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So they could fit into the railroad schedule noon over 20 minutes
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I put it to you
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Sonos series that people fought against the Rebellion are the railroad
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Oh there were time Wars and certain towns were part of the town would go to Railroad time but the other part would deter
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:57,216	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Permanently stick with what used to be local time at different times in the town
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Wow it's almost like as a personal freedom time in a way represents
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Your own identity
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And they would you want to give up their identity
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Money man Sandusky I meant every other Town eventually conform to Railroad time and that is how time became
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Standardized
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I'm became Zone

EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,280	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You ask somebody what time is it they don't say you know it's bedtime or just lunch
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I mean look up with this

EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Because there's a itsfunneh Robert like there's
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We just looked at the radar RSS
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:38,848	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	WeChat
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	It's a I don't know what it stands for it it's the thing that like feet iTunes
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,016	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	When you go on iTunes and you see all the episodes
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Suzhou to see
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	What was there
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:53,184	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And other some limit that's that iTunes places in the number of items that you can have in the feed
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And they're like a hundred fifty or something and we realize like
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:01,120	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	150 early episodes have fallen off
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	The feed a really yeah that way we were a backless like at random house that would be like Hemingway and fit
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Fitzgerald have fallen under the floors exactly select
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,360	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Huge number of old episodes of falling off
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:17,760	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And I start looking at that list and on that list or some episodes that are weirdly relevant now
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	A whole bunch that are just completely not relevant
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And I was like I think
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	I want to pull some of those back into the flow
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Because it'll give us a chance to like sort of just
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:33,120	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Reframe them and Rick think about them and update them and sometimes
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:39,520	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	Science gets old and needs to be updated but sometimes gets refreshed by something is happening in the real way
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:41,568	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	World's yeah
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	So what the plan would be is Maybe
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,944	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	You know in the coming months we would go
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,736	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	We back for us

EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:56,672	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And resurrect things and throw them out and see who wants to take a smack at them now
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,208	| radiolab_podcast17theradiolab |	And what it is things have changed
