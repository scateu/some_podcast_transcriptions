Are you awake

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,008
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,128
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,272
Peter Piper picked a peck of

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040

00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Offense

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,008
But I'm I'm excited to tell you now the rest of the story I feel like I've been holding out on you

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
And now

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Are to hold the line

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
So

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
So let's do first

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
The previously on I think

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
To the previously on is

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
We had so it was

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,856
December 1st 1992

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,000
You have these Mexican American High School kids from this

21
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
Poor neighborhoods High School Bowie High School in El Paso

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Right on the border

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
They

24
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Do the Border Patrol

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
Who is Jason is harassing them who's hassling them

26
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Because of

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Really the color of their skin

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,200
And they went they win this amazing improbable victory

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
To get the Border Patrol

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Stop

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
So that's where we are now

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Right

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
And

34
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Things are about to take some unexpected

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
Midterms

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
We're looking at the early 1990s the lawsuit was filed 1992

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
And right after that lawsuit

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,192
According to Tim Duncan sociologist actually turn it on.

39
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216

00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
He's out

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272

And they're bringing a new chief piss my name is sylvester daysland

45

00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,536
Been a veteran of the US border for 26 and a half years and he has a very different style

47
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Great spot here yeah

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
This is one of

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
My wife and I's favorite place what do you want me to

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Silvestre Reyes

Mexican restaurant on the outskirts of El Paso

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,872
Big guy broad shoulders, looks like gay

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Like a retired football player

54
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
But who is now a gram

Coffee with cream

00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Very kind face

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
For a guy who revolutionized how we deal with the Border you and you grew up here

59
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
We're sitting

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
Here but a mile from where I was born

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
Our farm was

62
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Northwest of here

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
We are

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
We grew cotton

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay alfalfa

66
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Watermelon some onions I'm the oldest of 10

67
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Six brothers and four sisters

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
He says that his brothers and sisters did I'll work on the farm along with a bunch of undocumented workers who

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Came in

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
From Juarez back then we had party line phone

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
So somebody would say

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Roberto's coming today

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
But they didn't know what time or where

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
So whenever that happened

75
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
I was

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Test2

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Citadel

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Two and a half ton truck

79
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
And he would watch the road

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
And I would blow the horn

81
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
At the first sign of what we would refer to his La Migra

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
To alert the workers

83
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Jesse calls at the greatest

84
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Irony of his life because

85
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Fast forward

86
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
To college I got drafted into the army

87
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
He gets drafted to go to Vietnam spent 13 months in Vietnam

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
That was a helicopter crew chief

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
I came back from Vietnam

90
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
I was scheduled to go back

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
But what happened in

92
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
1968 was

93
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
My dad

94
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
My second brother

95
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Was on his way to Vietnam

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
And

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
So

98
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
My

99
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
Dad was on his way to the airport

100
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
And he had an automobile accident

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
And got killed

102
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
So

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
I was the oldest

104
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
In the family

105
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
So

106
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
They let me out

107
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
To take care of the family

108
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm so

109
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,952
Raise needed a job being a veteran any federal exam they opened up for you

110
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
So he starts taking these federal job exam

111
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
The post office

112
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Bureau of Prisons Customs border

113
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
Patrol I mean just any test that I could cuz I have to make a living

114
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
And the very first place to call him back

115
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Border patrol

116
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah that was what was available

117
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Again Tim done so he becomes the kind of Pioneer in the board of choice one of the early

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
Hispanic agents when there were very few the job

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,439
Was tough cuz they didn't welcome you with open arms cuz your name is Reyes and not Smith or Jones

120
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
But I kind of enjoyed the challenge

121
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
He said he was dead set do everything twice as good and have

122
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
Pine and eventually he moved from being an agent into management and he works as well through management I was a first-line supervisor

123
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Kaiser through the ranks

124
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Second line supervisor

125
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Tata towel

126
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,639
Academy and he eventually becomes the first Hispanic sector chief

127
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Which means

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
In charge me

129
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Huge swath of the Border in Texas

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
So then come

131
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
1993 you are

132
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
Sector Chief and your sign back here

133
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
I was moved here in late June

134
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
And

135
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
In early July I decided to

136
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Assess the situation

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
And the situation

138
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
In El Paso

139
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Did not

140
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Look good

141
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
No

142
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Looks like there was a mess

143
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
So one of the first things Ria's discovers is that the border between the US and Mexico apaso is in a state of

144
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,807
Chaos chaos we were averaging about 10 thousand illegal entry

145
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
Add a add a unprecedented numbers Bend for trolling have enough people to get them all so people were telling me

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
That agents are pretty much running cycle through the city

147
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
Liberalism questioning everybody stopping people asking for their immigration status

148
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
And they're doing this despite the fact that they just got sued by these high school kids for doing essentially the same thing and just lost tooth is still

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Hanging over the patrol deal with that there was a huge deal it was making a chaotic

150
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,135
Which is worse and rias is on top of all of this there was a movement

151
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
When I got here to push the Border Patrol

152
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
Moved 25 miles out of the city

153
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
Two kind of creative borderless Zone around the city to unite El Paso and Juarez

154
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Who's coming the spirit of NAFTA opening up NAFTA is good for us because it will cut the tariffs on trade between the United States and

155
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA is going to open the border for the flows of goods and capital

156
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
But not people

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
And there's a little bit for people to

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
So they felt

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
That the border patrol is an invading Army they're the problem instead of the solution

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,423
ESO what he finds it that they're really unpopular and and that's just

161
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,031
Half the reason you're unpopular there's a whole bunch of other people that hate him for a whole different reason

162
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
Really yeah you when he got there he went on this listening walking tour of the neighborhoods along

163
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
On the Border there's there's whole neighborhoods there

164
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
But you are WETA

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
Barrio I want those neighborhoods and I talked to them

166
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
End

167
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
They thought the Border Patrol was a disaster

168
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,791
But instead of saying that the Border Patrol was over reaching that they were doing too much they felt

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,399
That the border patrol had failed him

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Had let them down

171
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,775
And the people that lived on those neighborhoods they felt like they were under siege

172
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
We have been broken rice

173
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
3 *

174
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Illegal immigrants

175
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
A little girl scared

176
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,783
People complain about burglaries about loitering people selling their Fruit Stand

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Knocking on doors asking for money

178
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Didn't like have to

179
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
Do it vendors all the time or people begging and didn't like having stuff stolen off their backyard garden hose a lawn chair

180
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
The phone off their clothes line gone

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Overnight

182
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
These people living right on the border wanted was more border

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,239
Patrol to stop what they perceive to be

184
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
You know migrant petty crime

185
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Aunt Susie he's really getting it from both sides

186
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
Yeah it's like a whole City's coming out

187
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
We were

188
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
With one foot on a banana peel

189
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Of getting driven out of town

190
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
That's why I had to change

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
And I didn't have a lot of time to do the

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Okay

193
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Sung so what does he do

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Well he had an idea

195
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
A pretty radical idea

196
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
I knew

197
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,351
There would be political pressure there would be public outcry

198
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
So you take this idea around to a bunch of

199
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
High level

200
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
The mayor of Juarez

201
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
The mayor of El Paso people at the Mexican consul in El Paso are going to in Juarez

202
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
The Sheraton

203
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Chief of police of Juarez in El Paso

204
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
Annie's going to each one of them and basically saying

205
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Look

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
If

207
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
We're able to correct

208
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
If I can quell the chaos

209
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Would they support the Border

210
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
And they said yes

211
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Okay so here's what I find so fast

212
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
It's September of 93

213
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,727
And while Reyes is hatching his plan at the same time at the El Paso Civic Center

214
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Honest one particular weekend

215
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,871
The United El Paso people are having this big convention

216
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Talking about how we can try and create this borderless

217
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,807
Community Resources local officials and Civic leaders are hammering out their proposals and everything

218
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Presenting to the audience

219
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
That same weekend

220
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Silvestre Reyes

221
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Rolls out

222
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
His plan

223
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
He wanted this to be a surprise

224
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
So we launched the operation at midnight

225
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
Since September 18th 1993 Saturday night

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
Reyes gathers all of his border patrol agent for Border Patrol

227
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
From all over the sector

228
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
And I breathe every single shift

229
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Allegiance

230
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Myself

231
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
I told him what was at stake

232
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
I told him that if this thing didn't work

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
They're going to run us out of town

234
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,087
My initial reaction was well this is going to be interesting

235
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
Retired border patrol agent David Hamm was there with his anti drug smuggling

236
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,303
And he said after the briefing we drove up the Border Highway on the Mexican side

237
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,679
And we got to downtown water sitting in the library about sunrise

238
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
And so he and his agents are waiting right at the Rio Grande

239
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
And the sun came up

240
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Any severe

241
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
At the border

242
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,407
She just saw all the wall border patrol

243
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
A wall of Agents along the river

244
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Hard yards Park

245
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Each one in their trucks

246
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Light green trucks

247
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
There helicopters buzzing

248
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,255
Lowell along the river there were floodlights every worth of the agents could be out there on the clock 24 hours a day

249
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Basically what race

250
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
Done is he created a human

251
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Wall on the border at the river.

252
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
It stretched for like

253
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
When my

254
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
And I had told my guys

255
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
We're in this for the Long Haul

256
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
What race was doing

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
This is his plan

258
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
Was to essentially change our strategy On the Border

259
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
How we police the border from a strategy of

260
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,183
Apprehension of letting migrants come in and running around chasing them sending them back

261
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
To one of deterrence

262
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
And called it operation blockade operation blockade

263
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
Day one on Sunday morning like they always did

264
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Hundreds of Mexican migrants tenders construction workers housekeepers

265
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
Waiting to cross into El Paso for work

266
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,551
But now they were confronted with the Berlin Wall On the Border

267
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
On the line

268
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Where they would have to wait him out

269
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,719
Waiting to see when the border patrol agents will pack up and leave

270
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,839
By the time night falls the migrants they just turn and go home and figure okay I guess we'll just

271
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
Come back in the morning they came back Monday

272
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
We were still there

273
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
And that's

274
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
When to start

275
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
Spaghet

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Chaos

277
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
D2

278
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Summit Amy Jacobson is standing by live under the paso del Norte bridge where the incident occurred

279
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Mexican took to the main bridge that connects El Paso and Juarez

280
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
Close the paso del Norte bridge and confronted border patrol

281
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,375
They blockaded traffic

282
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Skirmishes One agent was struck in the face with a rock blood and bandages still litter the area

283
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
Time there was screaming going on so racist how many races are there are all these headlines

284
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
The newspaper there are better ways to do this

285
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
Basically saying this new strategy is wrong operation blockade is nothing more than an attempt

286
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
To divide the community

287
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Race is the mayor of El Paso who he preached about the operation is denying ever knowing about it would call them when they said mayor

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Chief

289
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,263
I just didn't know what to do how many children are going hungry because their parents cannot come to El Paso

290
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
The local Bishop came out in

291
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Supper Club is winter

292
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
If a blockade continues

293
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
And this is only date

294
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Two of the blockade by Friday 3

295
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
Drawing of around 200 occupy the password

296
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
Things continued to get worse day for more protests

297
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
Day 5 6 7 at the end of the week

298
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
People were starting to get really desperate

299
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,215
But a remarkable thing happened that I didn't plant

300
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
The banners on private property around 2 shows

301
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Support for operation blog

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
The support for the border patrol just

303
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Skyrocket

304
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
List

305
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Support enforcing the laws that felt like they were under siege and the bowhead failed him

306
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,535
They came out with these huge banners of we support our border patrol

307
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
The tide ribbons on their cars that came out with

308
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Donuts and coffee

309
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,495
For the border patrol agents who were on the line it was like all of a sudden there was just sort of

310
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Flip people locally on love

311
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Across

312
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Racial and ethnic lines

313
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
A movie store

314
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Bella cosmetology

315
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
Because overtime what happened during this blockade was two things

316
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
1

317
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
Brian is one of the most popular reasons he's El pasoans are in favor of operation blockade

318
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Prime goes down

319
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
Now it's hard to tell whether this is actually

320
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Because of the blockade

321
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,911
But there's a reduction in petty crime some like 15%

322
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
That's the bottom line

323
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
And the second thing and this is way more surprising was it from Mexican Americans

324
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
Could being harassed by the border patrol presence in their neighborhood

325
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,967
They start to notice that is a ghost

326
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,111
The agents were gone right right it completely clear them out because now they were all down on the border

327
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
So there's this you know this

328
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
Tidal wave of support like

329
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
Virtually everybody locally in El Paso both sides

330
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,655
Are really happy with what he's doing you seem to solve the problem in one Fell Swoop

331
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
What was the reaction of Bowie High School

332
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
The

333
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Principal called me

334
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Paul strelzin

335
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
What's his name he's passed away

336
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
He called me

337
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
And he said

338
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Chief I hope you

339
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
I hope you

340
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Thought this out because

341
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
You are you have given us

342
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Our campus

343
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
But

344
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Right in the midst of all of this

345
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Silvestre Reyes

346
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Gets a phone call

347
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Phone call

348
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
From Washington DC

349
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,983
Saying you got to stop this

350
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
I'll tell you all about that phone call

351
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
And what falls out of that call

352
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591

Brilliant

Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

367

It just means you lean back and say

368
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
Maybe it was the moment that I

369
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,207
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

370
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
Or maybe the kid was a piano

371
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

372
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Or maybe the kids in math class

373
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Stay Ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

374
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
We're interested in the

375
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Epic moments where

376
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
A kid does something super smart

377
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
It doesn't have anything to do with it

378
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
If you have a story

This next part of the episode contains

388
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
Some moments that are very graphic

389
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
The depict death and I'm pretty

390
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Put away

Two part two of our border Trilogy from reporter lots of Nasser

396
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
When we left the story Silvestre Reyes had put into place operation blockade which was then renamed operation Hold the Line

397
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
And everyone in El Paso

398
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Seem happy

399
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Very happy

400
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah but people in Washington DC or not

401
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
The Clinton Administration they're about to have this vote on NAFTA other talking about free trade

402
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
And then this guy this little guy no pasta oh he's

403
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Created a blockade and looking like a little closer than I thought and the last thing the

404
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Ministration needs is

405
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Any controversy over the

406
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
Until right in the middle of operation blockade

407
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
Reyes gets a phone call from his

408
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Boss's boss's boss

Pilgrimage endocrino

410
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,031
No Janet we know who is the Attorney General

411
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
Big lady like her

412
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
I'm in even back then when she was

413
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Hammering away at me I'd like to

414
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
And she wanted to talk to me

415
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
And Chee

416
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Started

417
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Using talking points

418
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
Play it was a wrong thing

419
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
Political consequences International ramifications

420
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
He has this sense okay I'm

421
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,375
I'm about I'm about to be fired but he said to her

422
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Madam attorney general with all due respect

423
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Do me

424
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
One favor

425
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
I said

426
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Come and visit

427
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
El Paso just come and visit El Paso

428
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
I said because you are

429
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Making the statement

430
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
With all due respect without knowing

431
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
The difference that it's made

432
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
In El Paso

433
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Please come to us

434
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
She

435
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Silence

436
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
But she says

437
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
I will be there Tuesday

438
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,911
So Janet Reno fly to El Paso Reyes sets up a bunch of meetings for her and I told her I said look I'm not going to be there

439
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Cuz I want you to hear it

440
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
Unfiltered and your dad me being there

441
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
As he tells it Channel real sat down for all these meetings with all these local businesspeople and she was so blown away

442
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
By what she heard how

443
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
Happy everyone was with the situation that you put aside the fact that Mexico has been put aside NAFTA

444
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
She came back and

445
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Chi

446
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
You shook my hand

447
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Very impressive

448
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
What you've done here is amazing

449
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
What people are telling me is incredible

450
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
I mean she went on and on she says I'm going back and I'm going to tell

451
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
The president

452
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
That he needs to hear

453
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
You talk about

454
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
The president of the United States

455
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
We should just change her entire view after after one visit.

456
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,319
What he says and apparently she was barely there for a day

457
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
What

458
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
I wish we could get Janet Reno take on this but unfortunately she died in 2006

459
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Teen but

460
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,583
Her change of heart actually makes a certain kind of sense mean there was a real

461
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
A very important political element to all of this

462
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Text Doris meissner

463
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
She was at the time the head of the immigration Naturalization Service basically Janet Reno's number 2 when

464
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
When it came to the Border

465
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
And she says but at that moment the Janet Reno

466
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
In Texas touring El Paso the Clinton administration had a big problem on his hands

467
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,744
About a thousand miles west Californians are open arms

468
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
About the illegal immigration that is coming into California 40% of the babies born on Medicaid

469
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
In California today are born of illegal immigrants

470
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,944
We are going to take back California you had this wave

471
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,344
An initiative like Proposition 187

472
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,672
Problem by denying services to illegal immigrants

473
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Super hard line measure passed by a wide margin

474
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
The Clinton Administration was definitely paying attention

475
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
California is California a largest Electoral College fries in November's presidential election

476
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
California being a red state from 1968 all the way to 1992 Clinton was

477
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:17,856
The guy who broke the cycle and if he was going to get reelected California had to continue to vote

478
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,672
For the Clinton administration

479
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,096
So one of the things that might have changed Janet Reno's mind or more importantly your boss

480
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Bill Clinton's mind

481
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Was that they saw in El Paso

482
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
A potential solution to the California problem if they could make illegal immigration weigh less visible as rate

483
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Also

484
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Maybe they could hold the steak

485
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
I'm pleased to be here today

486
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040

493
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
We have just come from a meeting

494
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
With press

495
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Which time he signed a president

496
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Miranda

497
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
Directing RH

498
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
To move forward

499
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
With new edition

500
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Regain control of our borders

501
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
And better enforce our immigration laws

502
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
This is the first

503
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
National border patrol strategy

504
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,368
I spend a great deal of time on it things had not been done that way before

505
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,464
And it was a it was a fundamental change in strategy

506
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,072
According to Doris meissner and she really was the architect of the strategy

507
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
The idea was to

508
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
Take what Reyes was doing which was very clarifying and steal it up there were basically

509
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Play 4

510
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Major

511
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Crossing quarters

512
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Along the Southwest border

513
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,736
Each of those four spots that were going to amass border patrol agents

514
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
On the Border not

515
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,856
Behind the Border not in the city where they piss off the locals

516
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
But directly on the border

517
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
Concentrate resources

518
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
Starting of course in California

519
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
AR

520
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,888
Strategy was to start in San Diego because that was

521
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
The highest Crossing Court

522
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Maybe 45 to 50% of the crossings

523
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Across the entire Southwest border

524
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
We're happening in the San Diego sector

525
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,408
We start in San Diego with operation GateKeeper

526
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Then move to I believe Arizona and I'm just trying to think of what we name. Ever

527
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Operation safeguard

528
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,184
Exactly and then the fourth was southtex

529
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
All of a sudden now

530
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
In 1994 the Border Patrol

531
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Publishes this

532
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Was called the

533
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
The Strategic plan is also known as prevention through deterrence this is Jason De Leon again the Anthropologist who started us off

534
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
This whole series

535
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
Did they write in his policy document

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,432
We know the Border cut across a whole bunch of very difficult environments

537
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,784
If we disrupt traditional Crossing places Urban ports of Entry

538
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
And we push people toward these extreme environments

539
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
They will have to cross rushing Rivers

540
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,488
Mountainous terrain places that where you can freeze to death or you can die of

541
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Dehydration

542
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
But the extreme environment

543
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Will slow people movement

544
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Will make them easier to catch

545
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
And we'll also perhaps

546
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Stop them from coming

547
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Another word

548
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
After Reyes

549
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,592
It became our national strategy to push people away from urban areas

550
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
And you say

551
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
The desert

552
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
As a kind of natural deterrent thinking was the that would be a natural geographic

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
You know of

554
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
Allied that would

555
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Take care of

556
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
The rest

557
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Now one of the things

558
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Of course that we learn

559
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Is that

560
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
That that didn't hold

561
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:58,272
Because in the nineties the Mexican economy was struggling so people still need a jobs in that on the American side Farm

562
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
So people still cross

563
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,208
Crossing to the cities

564
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
They were crossing through the desert

565
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
No one was watching

566
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass

567
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
So sunstruck

568
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
They didn't know their own names

569
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,752
Justlikenew Reyes books The Devil's Highway

570
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
Going to remember where they come from

571
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Had forgotten how long

572
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
And so that's why

573
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
In the late 90s

574
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
You see the number of people dying in the Sonoran Desert overnight

575
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,160
Start to Skyrocket you go from 5 to 10 Bodies 2

576
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
The hundreds

577
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,328
By 2002 or so the numbers in Arizona or upper end $150

578
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
4 year a couple years after that it goes over 200

579
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,472
Those are the official border patrol numbers

580
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
That they report based on the number of bodies

581
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Found

582
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,736
But after Jason had that experience finding an arm in the desert and not being able to locate the rest of the body he started

583
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
You do wonder whether those numbers

584
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Were accurate

585
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
How many more people

586
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Might be dying out there

587
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Who are never found

588
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Never count

589
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Yeah

590
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Which for json at least

591
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
You became a scientific way

592
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
But what happens to bodies in the Dead

593
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
How fast

594
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,448
Do they decompose and what ends up happening is

595
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
I just kind of Hit the library

596
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Scout literature

597
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,848
You know his body Farms where we do this Tennessee Texas

598
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
Jason Thomas one paper that suggested that when bodies are decomposing in the desert heat in the dryness drastically slowed that

599
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
Down this idea that the debtors going to conserve

600
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Nobody is going to

601
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
Mummifying that people will be at the forever according to that paper could take up to six months for a body to decompose to the Bone

602
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
When will you be able to see the bone

603
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
But the remains in that

604
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,912
Study were collected in a bunch of different areas under

605
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Different condition sometimes even indoors no one have done it kind of in situ in the deserts beheading literally no

606
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
No scientific data on that at all

607
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
So I started getting really interested in

608
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Is there a way to

609
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
Do some science around me

610
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,624
He eventually wrote in an assistant named

611
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
Kate hall Hall and I'm a physical anthropologist

612
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
What's a physical anthropologist

613
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,072
A physical Anthropologist is someone at who

614
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Studies

615
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:27,520
At least 30 human bones and I try and infer what someone's life and death was like from skeletal remains

616
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Ions

617
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,128
Jason pretty much came up to me and told me that

618
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
He's been thinking about getting some pigs

619
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Pics

620
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,832
Pigs have long been at the common proxy for human bodies Buena for Crime Scene stuff like

621
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,392
They shoot them they bury them

622
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
And you know that you're using

623
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
Police different report of decomposition experiments

624
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
So

625
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,888
Jason and Kate and the research team had down to Arizona

626
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:59,008
University of Arizona has a meet laboratory at that deals with live animals so we called up

627
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Jerome

628
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
DIA

629
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Euthanizer

630
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
And he came out

631
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
In this big truck

632
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
He comes out with these animals to pigs

633
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
150 lb

634
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,856
Alive Jerome shoots the pigs in the head right in front of them

635
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
And then Kate and Jason we got shoes and socks

636
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Thruster pigs

637
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,536
Bra panties jeans t-shirts and clothes at migrants

638
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Because they wanted to recreate the conditions exactly

639
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,400
And then he took these dress dead pigs

640
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,240
Out into the desert arivaca Arizona

641
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,640
It's like another planet it's like nowhere else I have ever been on Earth

642
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
It's hot

643
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
And saying it's hot doesn't

644
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,880
Really do it justice

645
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,232
So get together in this big field

646
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
And we had one when pigs

647
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,144
Under a tree in lightshade we are trying to replicate like

648
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
If someone weighs

649
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
Tired and needed to take a rest somewhere

650
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
Lying in their groups and they would say well we didn't leave the person behind but we had to go they were dead so they would cover their body with rock

651
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
Fox in hopes of protecting them from animals

652
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Three places to pigs

653
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
One in the shade one under rocks

654
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
And they set up a series of motion sensing

655
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Cameras all around the perimeter of

656
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
The area

657
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
To watch

658
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Both pigs

659
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,912
These are the kinds of cameras that turn on if something moves we set up the cameras under a very very hot sun

660
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
And remember based on what Jason and read the prevailing idea was that bodies in the desert dome decompose until

661
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,760
Six months in around nine months in amount would make the likelihood that they'd be found

662
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Higher

663
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
Which might suggest that the official numbers are Act

664
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,880
Regardless the Assumption wise

665
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
That these bodies would be laying around for a while

666
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
But

667
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
Pretty quick

668
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Something moves

669
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
And triggers the camera

670
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:09,824
So this is footage of the pig that was in the shade and on the cameras you see

671
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Pig just under a tree lying on its side

672
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,456
Wearing his little white shoes it has

673
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
Jingdong

674
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Bloated

675
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
But it intact

676
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
And then

677
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
Later that night camera comes on against night vision

678
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
You can see the pig again

679
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
And then

680
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
See this vulture

681
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
A few feet away from the pig

682
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,984
Kind of looking at it kind of checking it out

683
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Just

684
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Standing there

685
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
And then

686
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
After a couple of hours

687
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Camera comes back on

688
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Another eight vultures

689
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
On top of this pic

690
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,624
And staring

691
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,000
A few hours later they go and they make a hole in the back of the neck

692
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,912
Kind of like kind of right behind the ear and they're trying to connect the brain and then

693
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,080
Turn off the shirt they eventually ripped the jeans off

694
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
By noon is a 50 there are

695
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,736
Hordes of vultures

696
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Attack

697
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
The abdomen

698
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
Richtofen the stomach and then you see

699
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
Intestines being pulled out and then you have two vultures come in front of the camera and they're playing tug-of-war with the

700
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Seize intestines and

701
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
They start to take apart

702
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,752
The limbs will actually like carry them away they will carry linzess like

703
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
Convenient packages of meat

704
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
They can eat later

705
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,480
27 they dragged what was left of the body about 20 m

706
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Upper Hill

707
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
And within 9 days they had picked

708
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
Picked it clean

709
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
Everything's been pulled apart

710
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Anxious

711
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
Scattered all over the place

712
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
After 9 days

713
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
There's hardly anything left nine days

714
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah so they thought it might take 9 months

715
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
And now it's down to nine days and and that was the pig in the shade the pig in the Little Rock Cut The Bad Pig

716
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Went way fast

717
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,200
Yeah that was within 24 hours for Ultra 2 started feeding

718
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,040
I just got in underneath the rocks and ripped it up because we felt we had really forgotten that

719
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
The rocks

720
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Conduct heat

721
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
So it literally Cooks the body and speeds up the

722
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
This process

723
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
It will completely defied

724
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Expectation

725
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:41,376
This wasn't all you're expecting at all vultures the only scavengers that you were known as

726
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,496
Not the only scavengers so we saw some Ravens to must have dogs

727
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:51,360
So this town of arivaca where we working a lot of people dying nearby and they have these

728
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
You know kind of ranch dogs that are pretty wide-ranging

729
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,248
And people have I'd heard stories of people singing on my. Came home with a

730
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,296
With a piece of human bone

731
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
But these animals

732
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
We're in or on our property eating these pigs

733
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,768
I'm just now thinking it from the point of view of the dog owner on like this dog comes in and gets on the couch like

734
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
That's the same tongue that might have been

735
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
Knowing on a human arm exactly

736
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:21,056
And after the vultures and crows and dogs that have their way with these pigs Jason K told us that the desert started working in small

737
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
Mahler invisible

738
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
Waze

739
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,784
I have never seen this before like we used to flies and some Beatles but

740
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Consuming parts of

741
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
Long bones are chipping off pieces of bone

742
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
I'm carrying them off to this ant hole a meter away

743
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Not there

744
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
For for long enough note and they will completely disappear this is an environment in which people can become really easily

745
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Just erase

746
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
Well there is something about when you when you were describing

747
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,408
The first moment when the vault is really sort of

748
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Taryn to the body

749
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,576
I haven't by found myself going to recoil and trying to protect my abdomen I still have

750
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
That reaction

751
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
There's something just

752
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
So

753
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,488
Overwhelmingly human about this

754
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
You can't not take

755
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
Personally

756
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
What can we talk about the

757
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
The numbers for second

758
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Because if

759
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Bodies

760
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Are decomposing and disappearing

761
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
This fast

762
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Does border patrol numbers

763
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Start to look sick

764
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Suspiciously

765
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
Low

766
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Do you have any sense based on

767
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
The speed of decomposition

768
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
How many people

769
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,136
We might be missing you know it just

770
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,952
It just depends I mean on the phone when people die

771
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:47,840
At what time of year that I mean if you live in a better way to do is if you compare the number of missing persons reports

772
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
With the numbers of recovered bodies

773
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
There's a discrepancy of

774
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
1000

775
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
These are missing persons reports

776
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,872
From America and missing persons reports are filed in the US by families already here

777
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Or or

778
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,736
Trump sending countries but thousands of missing persons reports

779
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
More than the natural recovered bodies

780
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,392
Thousands a year how to go missing a year during the process

781
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
Obviously missing persons reports don't equate to deaths in the desert

782
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,840
But pretty much everyone I talk to including some retired border patrol agents

783
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
Agree that the official number is

784
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
When it comes

785
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
To the actual number of deaths

786
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Nobody knows for sure

787
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,104
Depending on who you ask the real number could be anywhere from

788
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
Twice to 10 times the official count

789
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,016
And if you think about the fact that that has been happening

790
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
420

791
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Years

792
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Then what that

793
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,952
High School history teacher one cyber Coronado told us at the end of our last episode

794
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
That sounds so crazy

795
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
Because of us

796
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
Fences were built

797
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
Because the fences were built

798
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
Maybe 10000

799
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
People have died in the day

800
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
There's no way to verify that number

801
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Or any number

802
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,128
But the potential scale of it

803
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
Kind of forces you to ask

804
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
Who is responsible

805
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
Some of these people I talked to said that the

806
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,600
Mexican government needs to do more to stop people going into these areas

807
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
Others blame the Smugglers who bring people over

808
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
Some people have said that the migrants themselves

809
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Vdara Spa

810
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,584
They knew they were making this decision to come if they die it's on them

811
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
The other obvious question is

812
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
What About Us

813
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Yeah

814
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,080
And what's clear you know json is

815
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
Bad

816
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
US policy makers one exactly

817
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
Play clueless about this

818
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
There were points where people were saying things like

819
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,112
If we do this if we funnel them towards Addison or desert of Arizona at we funnel them towards the port of Backwoods of Texas

820
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
People are going to get hurt people are going to die

821
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,232
But if enough people died perhaps that will be

822
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
The deterrent then that they'll stop coming

823
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
Is that written down

824
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
It is oh my God I said death equals two turns there's a chart that eyesight in the book and this is one of the one of the moment

825
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Where I was

826
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
When I was doing the kind of archival research that just

827
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,152
Just shocked me where there was a point with someone written this policy document

828
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,992
Alanine one of the follow-up reports by the government accountability office

829
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,368
Some numbercruncher or some policymakers sitting at a computer and DC

830
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
Making an Excel chart

831
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,536
Work they're putting out different metrics to measure the effectiveness of this policy and one of the metrics is

832
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
An increase in in in migrant death

833
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,960
There was a recognition that if death goes up it means that this policy is working

834
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,848
I ended up finding the document Jason was referring to it's a report from the government accountability office

835
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
1997

836
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,432
And it also mentioned said in other areas death might also

837
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
Go down

838
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
I wanted to talk to Doris meissner about

839
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,392
Cottage cheese remember the former ins commissioner that help take the Sylvester Rhea's Hold the Line strategy Nash

840
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
And actually read part of the report

841
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Yes

842
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,024
And then there was this kind of one appendix

843
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,144
Sin it is 5 and it's indicators for measuring the effectiveness

844
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Of the strategy

845
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
Tradutor illegal entry

846
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,288
Along the Southwest borders and one of the indicators was death

847
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
Deaths of aliens attempting entry

848
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
And basically what it says is that

849
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Is recording at that

850
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
If the Attorney General strategy

851
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,808
Successful deaths may increase

852
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,880
As enforcement in urban areas vs Aliens 2

853
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
To attempt mountain or desert

854
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Crossings in FL

855
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Text saying that

856
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
If the strategy

857
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,304
It if it just increase in these

858
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Treacherous areas

859
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
That's a sign that the strategy is working

860
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
Think I recall

861
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
Reading that because it's so

862
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,920
What makes you gasp when you have to really think about

863
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
What the

864
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
All of the implications of all these things are

865
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
When you know this is one of those

866
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
Paradoxes of

867
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
How is it that you go about doing work like

868
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
It's absolutely

869
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
We're

870
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:03,840
Ferb so many reasons that there needs to be border security

871
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
But I think it is

872
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Fair to say

873
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
That

874
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:15,360
The idea that we had at the time and the thinking that we put into place at the time

875
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
Was too simple

876
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:23,552
What was much more difficult to take into account it has been the tenacity

877
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
Of people

878
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
Coming to the United States

879
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
Wanted to come to the United States

880
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
And the length

881
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
To which people will go

882
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
In order to do that

883
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
What that there's another way to read this means the

884
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,984
The appendix five the sooner the thing that that has you in your words

885
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,032
You said you know could make you gas

886
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
With that sort of says

887
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,408
And one way to read that is that we took

888
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
Problem that was very visible

889
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
And we push it to places we can't see it anymore

890
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
And

891
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
We did that with full knowledge

892
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Did that

893
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
That people dying means we're doing the right thing

894
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,560
Tatume appendix V begs the question mean what responsibilities do we

895
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Have

896
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
For this

897
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,984
It doesn't quite feel like this is something that we can just shrug and say we didn't know this is going to happen

898
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
It feels like we knew damn well this

899
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
What's going to happen

900
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,848
You know when you asked

901
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,176
The question what is our responsibility and when you say our

902
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
I think

903
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,272
And I take that to mean what is our responsibility as a nation

904
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
The answer at the time and the answer still is

905
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
That

906
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,000
The enforcement will do everything that I can to

907
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Prevent

908
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
People from Crossing in dangerous areas

909
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
But that

910
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
Cannot include

911
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
No longer

912
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
Doing enforcement across the bar

913
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:51,360
Nudura says that you know once they started to realize these numbers it's spiked and if people were going through these areas they started doing

914
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:56,735
In a lot of public awareness campaigns information campaigns warning people about the dangers of

915
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
The desert

916
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:03,647
Devoted to safety on the Mexican side of the created a whole new search-and-rescue unit cell

917
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
There were

918
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
All kinds of efforts

919
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
To address it

920
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,583
But I will be absolutely Frank with you

921
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,983
The idea of abandoning any kind of strengthening border enforcement

922
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
Because of that consequence

923
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Was not a serious

924
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
I would not appoint a serious

925
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Discussion

926
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,943
And the policy never really changed

927
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
Substantiv wait there was a later report that came out from the government accountability office

928
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
2006

929
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,695
That basically said you look you've done all these safety measures but the death in the desert are

930
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Still going up

931
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,071
Doris meissner was no longer head of the ins-and-outs

932
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,655
Point but after reaching out to a whole bunch of people who wrote that report and

933
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
And the people received it

934
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
And peering

935
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
Nothing back frankly

936
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,847
I finally got in touch with the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under President Bush at

937
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
The time Ralph Basham

938
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,967
Now retired and he told me he remembered reading that report

939
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,039
He said that you thought about those deaths all the time everyday

940
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,391
But in the end she said it was just politically infeasible to back off the enforcement

941
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
At the major Crossing Point

942
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,511
Sort of getting a border patrol to really control dangerous areas like

943
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
The desert

944
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,911
And in the end the US government didn't make any substantive changes in response to the rising desk

945
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
And I guess you could

946
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
Read that as a lack of political will or indifference

947
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
But Jason actually argues that

948
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
We were giving a

949
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,991
Blessing to the system that was killing all these people because

950
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
It kept his problem just

951
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,575
Swept under the rug

952
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Yeah

953
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
Are you saying that

954
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
The US

955
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Government

956
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Whatever portion of it is responsible for this policy

957
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Is knowingly

958
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Killing people

959
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
I would say it's knowingly putting people In Harm's Way

960
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
And I know that there is a high likelihood

961
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
That

962
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
Bob certain percent of people are going to die

963
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,783
It happened I was like they're having nature do the do their dirty work that's kind of what you

964
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,879
Feel like it's absolutely I mean I would say 100% that nature is an agent of

965
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Border patrol

966
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:18,303
It's at this kind of unsung hero of the border patrol either not on the payroll but they do all this work

967
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
The environment beats up on migrants

968
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
And then those who don't make it

969
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
It just cleans up the mess as well

970
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,799
I'm in nobody has to be accountable for this because it just disappears

971
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,247
We asked Customs and Border Protection which oversees border patrol 2

972
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
Comment whether they had tried to

973
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
To change their strategy to avoid migrants

974
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
And they decline to answer

975
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,767
I wonder if I wonder if you feel somehow ambivalent about it like

976
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,119
Obviously there are trade-offs for everything every every

977
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
You plan has unintended consequences

978
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,519
But but this now this has happened and and these deaths

979
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Are also happening

980
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,639
I wonder how you feel about it if you feel somehow I am busy

981
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,503
I feel deeply ambivalent about it I feel deeply

982
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,575
Sorry about it I am very conflicted about it

983
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
I also know

984
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
That

985
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,719
Migration is by its very nature

986
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,839
Incredibly dangerous Enterprise but you know when it's illegal immigration

987
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,191
People coming up in a well before they ever get to the US border

988
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
People coming up

989
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,799
Through Mexico through very dangerous areas where

990
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:39,199
They are robbed and kidnapped and extorted I mean there are awful Terrible Things That Go On

991
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
In this quest for a better life

992
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
What I wish

993
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Is that

994
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
We would be able as a country

995
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,255
Support immigration policies into a fact that it actually allow for people to come here legally

996
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,327
Kumar economy is asking for

997
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,887
In terms of the jobs that exist in the country

998
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
This

999
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,007
System that we've been involved with for now

1000
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Decades

1001
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:11,199
Allowing illegal immigration to occur in sizable numbers

1002
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,759
Having work for people in this country

1003
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Is indefensible

1004
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,439
And the enforcement agencies are caught in between that they're required

1005
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
2

1006
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,791
Create border security and yet there are these

1007
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Terrible

1008
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Cost

1009
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
Those terrible cost

1010
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
Would not be there

1011
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,239
If we as a country and as a political system

1012
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
Would come to grips

1013
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,359
With the issue that is right in front of our eyes

1014
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:43,967
And that we simply won't come together politically to answer

1015
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
We are a nation of immigrants

1016
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,855
We are a country that believes in the rule of law

1017
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
We

1018
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,951
Can't wait is indefensible

1019
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
In light of that history

1020
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
And those values

1021
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
To have a loud

1022
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,679
This kind of an illegal immigration picture

1023
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,287
To go on in the way that it has for all these many years

1024
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:17,503
Wooden wall I mean this is going to sound misses an intentionally knife question but

1025
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,575
If what you're saying is that that

1026
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
That

1027
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
We need to save lives

1028
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
Weather how we feel about

1029
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
The issue of immigration

1030
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Is it a wall more humane

1031
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Given what you just told us

1032
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
Well the walls not going to do anything

1033
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
I mean we know that

1034
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,983
Yeah I spend a lot of time now most of my time is not then with Smugglers

1035
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
Who loved the idea of a wall

1036
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,359
Cuz they're like man I can charge twice as much for this for my services

1037
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Even though

1038
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
It's really not going to be that much harder

1039
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,039
Cuz people dig underneath it they crawl over it they fly over at they take a boat around it I mean

1040
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
The wall itself is never going to

1041
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
It's never going to be at

1042
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Deterrent

1043
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,303
And on top of that I actually I didn't even know this

1044
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
When we talked to Jason

1045
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:10,495
But if you listen to the things that President Trump has said about the wall since coming into office

1046
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
2000 miles

1047
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,687
Because of nature because of mountains and rivers and lots of he would end up just being

1048
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,527
Even stronger version of this policy

1049
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,391
And you have a river a river

1050
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:33,535
I need an even stronger funnel interviews very places that are killing people

1051
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,095
And erasing any evidence

1052
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Of their death

1053
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,583
This episode of our border Trilogy was reported by lots of Master with Tracy hunt
