1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,088
Do you do you just want to like lay out for us the chronology of your

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Obsession I think I feel comfort

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,768
What's a dalliance I mean you just noticed

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,072
Crumbling building and ran over to

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,400
Sticker can I mean I am

9
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
I'm a contrarian

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,824
I'm interested in alternative facts about science let's say

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod

12
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:54,272
I'm a back row which this is Radiolab

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
Talk to a science journalist named Dan ingber

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
Who got us kind of Tangled Up

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,464
About something that we thought we knew about the world but ourselves

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Something beautiful as I recalled that we talked about a great links on the show

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,376
Hello hello and said that conversation up

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
We're going to start

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Isaac Steele

20
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
Pastor Claude Steele

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,824
Eastern's Emeritus professor of psychology at Stanford University

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
We actually had him on the show

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
Number of years ago sometimes I can't remember how many years ago is 2000

24
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
On the show back then was because he had done study in the mid-90s that just completely change the way that we thought

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
About

26
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
The power of stereotype

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Well my mother was white my father was African American and they were very active in the Civil Rights Movement so you can imagine

28
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,848
The erase was no distant or passing thing

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
In our life

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Family for Claude growing up that was just

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Everyday dinner table

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Yes exactly

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
So the topic

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
This is so the family Birthright

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
Then years and years later Midway through his career as a

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Psychology

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
Claude ran into a demonstration of the power of race that

38
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
Really surprised and I got a job offer this is in the 80s

39
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,216
University of Michigan and it was part psychology and part to administer a minority

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Student program there

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,848
This is Clydesdale the original program we ran back in 2009 and

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
In the process I think I saw dated at surprise me

43
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
What he saw was a

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Troubling trend

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,088
Two kids would enter Michigan one was black one was white they come in

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Exact

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Same level same skills

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,512
Same SAT score should do the same when they get to Michigan but

49
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Without fail

50
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Or almost

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
I feel after one semester or I could was

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
Winding up with lower grades how much lower

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Pretty pretty pretty dramatic

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,872
At least two-thirds of a letter grade in a black kid who should be getting an A2 is

55
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
He said getting a b

56
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Insignificant

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
Also by the way saw this performance cap

58
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Between women and men

59
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,672
When it came to math to the same degrees degree in advanced math courses it was

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Comfortable

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
I learned this is a national phenomenon

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
If I was to walk into Emma's any college class

63
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
In the United States

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912
I have a very high probability of finding exactly that

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,616
So I think it's important to put it in context of what was going on at the time this is Dan anger again and he says that that

66
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
Japanese treatment between black and white students that clouded notice

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,088
It was actually a huge topic of conversation at the time there's a lot of discussion of what to do about this evening cap

68
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
And

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
The Familiar argument is well this has to do is systemic racism and systemic

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Differences in opportunities

71
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
That play out

72
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Through

73
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
An individual life span

74
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
That seems right

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
It's also daunting

76
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Because our we ever going to be like

77
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Cure all of it

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Socioeconomic status in our own country

79
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
But then

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
In 1994

81
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Different and in many ways very dangerous idea was being tossed into this debate Charles Murray

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Co-author of the book The Belk

83
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
When the bell curve

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Came out the bell curve

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
Intelligence and class structure in American Life

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,911
Bell curve argued that one explanation for the treatment Gap among others was genetic

87
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
IQ Bass

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Of course

89
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
It's not

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
But even though there is no scientific backing at all

91
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
For the idea of genetic differences like this

92
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
The bell curve was still significant just because of the kinds of

93
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Conversations

94
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
It was creating of the time the effect it had on researchers in this

95
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
Well the bell curve is one point in a long history of that

96
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Kind of argument.

97
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,511
The difference between groups really is rooted in genetics

98
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Let's just be frank and honest and if you really can't admit that

99
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
Then you don't have the courage needed to be a real science

100
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
That's a thumbnail way of describing this experience that I've have been confronted with

101
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
With that note

102
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
This was obviously disturbing to Clyde first on a personal level in order to be a scientist are you

103
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,855
You supposed to actually be open to the possibility that you and your

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Your family and your whole race

105
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Have some genetic

106
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
Limitation but also because it was so weak

107
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Scientifically

108
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
It's been very difficult

109
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Colts impossible

110
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
To produce anything like definitive data

111
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
That the

112
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Between groups

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Genetic differences between christening and Michigan clearly wouldn't be explained by genetic differences

114
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
It also didn't seem to him like it could be

115
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Explained

116
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
Simply by their backgrounds or their opportunities

117
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:48,159
Because you take what's a black and white kittens Michigan they both have extraordinary scores like

118
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
You know during the 98

119
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Percentile on the SAT

120
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
So the background

121
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Between the two kids

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Whatever it is

123
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Has not resulted in

124
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
In a difference to that moment in time

125
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
So if going forward and taking a test

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
The black kid gets a lower score or lower performance in a chorus of some sort

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
There's something must be happening

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Right there

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Right there

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Something must be happening in the moment

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
There was something

132
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
There

133
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
That people didn't understand that we certainly

134
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
So he figured he would start with the woman in math

135
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
He brought a bunch of a bunch of men

136
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
Software documents in the laboratory one-at-a-time gave them a half an hour section of the graduate record exam

137
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Can you take if your a math major

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Very very difficult math

139
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
And sure enough

140
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
The women who had all the same credentials coming into the situation

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Perform dramatically worse than the man worse as a couple hundred points in an SAT test

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
So Claude Steele. Alright

143
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
Step 1 complete I've got a lab situation

144
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
It resembles the real world good next step is to

145
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Tweak things a little bit see if I can mess around with it

146
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Normally in these situations

147
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,103
Test givers got a white lab coat on and he brings in a big stack of cellophane wrap test

148
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Put the clock on the table that solve it's all like that's

149
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,623
Intimidate almost anybody maybe that's what's happening

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
What if I took away the

151
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,023
Took away the coat and most importantly

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,399
Right before the test I had the test giver instead of saying the normal I'm going to give you a test

153
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Protest thing maybe instead

154
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Say something like that

155
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,871
Look you may have heard that women don't do as well as men on difficult standardized math test

156
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
You may have heard that

157
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
But that's not true for this particular to

158
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
This particular

159
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Does not show gender

160
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Never has never will he wondered

161
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
It may be saying that

162
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Simple sentence before giving the test

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Have an effect

164
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
And sure enough

165
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
I wouldn't be here if

166
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Their performance didn't go up in

167
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,679
Go up to match that of the equally skilled man that performance Gap

168
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Vanish

169
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
She look at this

170
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
So we raced and did it

171
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Very quickly the same company

172
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Experiment with African America

173
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,919
They're the pretest disclaimer went like this

174
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
That we use to study

175
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Problems

176
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
And it is not diagnostic

177
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Pic of individual

178
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Intellectual

179
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Mobility in other words this

180
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,231
Is not a test of your intelligence I repeat not an IQ test so just do the best

181
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
You can't with that simple disclaimer to start

182
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
The black students

183
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
And the white students

184
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
1 L equal

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Just recently

186
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,335
Ryan Braun and Eric dated at you clever

187
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,479
Treatment think there is a an IQ test which is nonverbal healthy Advanced Progressive matrices has

188
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
Figures very abstract I got

189
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
Lines crossing that you have to match

190
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
This essentially pattern match diamonds with dots in them

191
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
And so they could represent that test as it as it is an IQ test attraxion is the gold standard of IQ tests because it's cold

192
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
Culture free no math there's no reading because it doesn't involve language or you can represent the exact same test

193
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
As a puzzle

194
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,687
Meaning you can give an IQ test to watch a kids and the black students will perform worse but if you give that same test

195
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,295
Lose the word test lose the word IQ just call it a puzzle to Black participants

196
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Suddenly

197
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,695
Jump up and they're performing basically we got a reversal represented as a puzzle black before me as well as white

198
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Let Me Tell Ya that's all it takes

199
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Just change a few words

200
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Stereotypes of powerful okay that makes sense

201
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Snapper in terms of understanding how this works

202
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Can you make this

203
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Tactile stimuli

204
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
If the stereotype

205
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Having all these effects is like a

206
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Like a little Gremlin that bites

207
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
When in the test-taking process is it actually like

208
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Do it stand up

209
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Whale

210
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:12,351
What does seem to be clear from the data according to Erik day and Ryan Brown and Claude Steele is it the gremlin

211
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Only seems to appear

212
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
When the test is sufficiently hard

213
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
If the test is easy it's important to point out

214
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
These effects don't happen

215
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
It's not that the gremlin is not there with you

216
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
But he doesn't speak necessarily

217
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,759
Until things get challenged as soon as the task is difficult

218
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,623
Which means it for most of the test everybody's doing about the same it's only a problem number

219
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
17

220
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,559
Cosines and factorials whatever where things start to go wrong at least that's the theory at that problem

221
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
The black student

222
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
Starts to stiffen up a little bit

223
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Your blood pressure is elevated there

224
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Short-term memory is impaired

225
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,847
Flicker of frustration through their body that wakes up the gremlin who starts

226
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
To whisper in their ear I love you can do this

227
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
Is what they say about us true they don't think you can do it all the usual

228
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,087
Even if the student doesn't believe it which is likely so you don't have to believe it that's

229
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
The kind of Insidious thing here just the fact

230
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Did he has now

231
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
Extra bit of mental chatter that little guy Whispering Willows a distraction

232
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Makes their performance go down

233
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Just a little bit hold this dialogue

234
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,263
Is keeping you from being 100% focused on the task at hand which is solving these problems who the real

235
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Subtle

236
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
Power of a stereotype isn't it prevents you from doing the thing you want to do

237
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
It diss track

238
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Cu

239
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Forget the beat

240
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
I'm doing the thing you want to do

241
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
You and that may be all the difference

242
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:48,607
So that's how we ended the piece that we did back in 2009 but in the Years

243
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
After Claude did that original study

244
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Defect

245
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
She called stereotype threat

246
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Became one of the biggest

247
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,615
Stereotype threat and most important ideas

248
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
In all of social psychology

249
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,783
But now some psychologists say stereotypes can become self-fulfilling prophecy

250
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
Steel ladies and gentlemen is my great pleasure 2%

251
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Clydesdale

252
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
It became a sort of academic

253
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,815
Rockstar

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
Speaking to overflowing audiences to places like Columbia and

255
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Cornell

256
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
Steel

257
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
And this idea of a stereotype threat was shown to be relevant in cases with that had to do with age and socioeconomic status

258
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
There were studies about women playing chess

259
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
Men being tested on like social Sensitivity I mean

260
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
Clyde's work ended up inspiring sort of the whole

261
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Generation of social psychology

262
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Yeah I mean I was I would say that

263
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
The original stereotype threat paper by Steele and Aronson you blew me away

264
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
Spoke to me and was beautiful and it seemed to

265
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Offer

266
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Answers

267
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
You have two questions that you have come with me

268
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
So this is Michael and

269
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
And I'm

270
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
A professor of psychology at

271
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
University of Toronto

272
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
So when did you begin

273
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
If you could give us over the cliff notes version of your history with

274
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Stereotype threat in particular

275
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
I mean

276
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
I think

277
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
I was certainly attracted to

278
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,423
That's that part of social psychology that dealt with prejudice and discrimination

279
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Some Jewish I went to New Jewish

280
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
They scored High School in Canada

281
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
Perhaps bacon to me was

282
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Desire to to prefer social justice

283
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,759
And you know seeing you know what the evils of prejudice and you know how

284
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
It was evil taking their logic

285
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Dreamwalker happens

286
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
I was passionate about the topic

287
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
I

288
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
Sort of explanation that also offered

289
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Route to easy solutions

290
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Text effects

291
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
Sounds like you really came into it with a very social political

292
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Should have been stuite yes that's right

293
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,287
I wanted my work to have an impact I wanted it to

294
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
You have to change the world

295
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
Coming up after the break

296
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
Michael tried to change the world but the world kind of changes

297
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Yeah

298
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,255
Hi this is Vincent Rojas from Norman Oklahoma Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

299
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,839
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

300
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,679
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

301
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

302
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
And I'm here because I need your help

303
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
And I request

304
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,039
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

305
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,879
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

306
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Tiny moments of brilliance

307
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,279
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

308
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
It just means you read back and say

309
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Well

310
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
How do they do that

311
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Maybe it was the moment that I

312
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

313
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Do you

314
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Or maybe the kid was a piano

315
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,919
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

316
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,783
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

317
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
We're interested in the

318
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Epic moments where

319
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
Kid does something super smart

320
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

321
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
If you have a story

322
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
T-shirt with us

323
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071

Brilliance

328
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Thank you so much

329
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Chad Robert Radiolab we're back

330
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
And we're talking about Claude Steele's seminal research

331
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,767
On stereotype threat how the threat of a negative stereotype

332
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Can impact a person's academic performance

333
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
Sprite and just before the break we were talking to Michael into it

334
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,775
Cool after getting into stereotype threat research you went on to grad school and really

335
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Focused in on stereotype threat as his

336
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Fielder's choice

337
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,199
Yeah so how many studies of stereotype threat did you end up to it

338
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
I would say in the order of like

339
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Number of studies

340
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
20 maybe 15 to 20 something like that

341
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
He did a lot of studies on women's performance in math but also just looking at different environments and how they create or incur

342
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Courage the stereotypes

343
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,191
And over the course of his career he ended up editing a book about stereotype threat

344
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
I mean numerous

345
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
Talks on the subject all over the world even signed a brief kind of explaining stereotype threat to the Supreme Court

346
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
States the Supreme Court heard the oral argument in Fisher V University of Texas at Austin as it applied to the question

347
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
Of affirmative action the court will decide where the race used in University and College admission policies it's constant

348
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,231
I'm sorry you don't put my name to this

349
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,375
But then

350
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,799
I started my current job at the University of Toronto

351
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
In 2005 and while he was there he was running a lot of his stereotype threat research on women and men

352
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
Matthew know giving women a test and then doing some intervention to reduce the stereotyped and seeing if there be a difference in

353
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Standard test scores

354
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
And

355
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Sympathy

356
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
For the first time I was not able to consistently

357
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,375
Show any effect of stereotype threat in other words the women who had received this

358
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
Stereotype threat reducing intervention perform just about the same as the women who hadn't

359
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
You know

360
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Belta Tropical Smoothie

361
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
Let me go back to the drawing board let me think about

362
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
What is my house my population differ

363
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,135
And his first thought was maybe have something to do with Toronto petrano

364
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
Someplace like take the Freshman psych classes

365
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
We're talking about a third East Asian 1/3 South Asian and only about 15%

366
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Caucasian or european Canadian

367
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:21,823
And then a little bit of everything else so he started wondering

368
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
About you know women in math

369
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
I'm in remarkably when I would ask you know our students this

370
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Mikey task know who here is heard of The Stereotype that women are bad at math I would say no more than

371
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Like a quarter to a third

372
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,951
Add your strong awareness of the stereotype

373
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,791
Joey started running experiments again but I'd only pek

374
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
Those women and men

375
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Who actually had awareness

376
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
But even then

377
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
I still then come get the f

378
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
I'm so sick okay well

379
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
Maybe I'm doing something wrong like maybe the interventions he was designing weren't reducing the threat or with these goons maybe this

380
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
The threat just wasn't that much of a threat in the first place

381
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
But by this time Michael had already done

382
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Ton of research on

383
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
Stereotype threat and you know I done I'm a person who gets bored

384
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
A rather quickly Majesty know started

385
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Amazon

386
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
But just a couple years later well so

387
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Things changed

388
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
On October 17th

389
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,007
2011 this one paper was published in the paper called

390
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
False positive psychology

391
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
In this paper details

392
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
Help just by doing some very standard practices

393
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
In Psychology research you could sometimes end up with

394
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
These sort of

395
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Ludacris conclusion

396
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Yeah

397
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,279
So you're saying there was this paper was showing ways in which

398
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
Experimenters could subtly unknowingly juice the results that is NC

399
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
What it was essentially so the paper was pointing out that it becomes her standard practice that you know when you were research

400
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,383
Searching for some effect like oh how happy people were about well they did on a test

401
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,479
That you would measure that thing in a couple different ways

402
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,111
Which direction is considered a good practice right you want to know one measure captures your konstrukt perfectly

403
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
So you should measure that thing in this many You Know Places pasta

404
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,303
But now what if you find that it could Works your hypothesis

405
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Just confirmed with one of those measures

406
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
But it's not confirmed with

407
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Three or four of the other one

408
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:30,847
And it was not uncommon practice at that point to just be no report the one place where you got in effect

409
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
You could even argue that you were just

410
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Dialing in exactly where this effect

411
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,319
Happens but the paper this fall psychology paper pointed out that if you ignore the places

412
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,159
Where it didn't work a picture of

413
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
Weather

414
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Find the data you look at all of it

415
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Might not actually support

416
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Your conclusion I remember reading that

417
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
My jaw dropped

418
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
I sent this

419
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,007
This paper I circulated it to the other faculty in my department

420
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
And

421
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
All of us

422
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Are many of us

423
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
I saw the

424
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
The importance of this paper

425
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,295
And we we call emergency meeting for a call emergency meeting

426
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,903
What is an emergency meeting look like

427
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
The Graduate students

428
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Discuss the contents of the paper

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
To see what I meant

430
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
What implications were and if they talked it over they realize that in some ways probably some of their own work

431
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Mom had fallen prey to the problems that this paper was

432
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
I did see myself in in some of this

433
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
And I thought

434
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
You know how like will he know

435
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
What has been implicated what papers of mine

436
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
What paper is more generally have been implicated in the fields unibit large

437
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,208
And in fact meetings like the one that Michael found himself in start happening at universities and conferences

438
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
All over the world

439
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah

440
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,072
People looked at that paper and everyone thought

441
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,472
Just an anger again this is this is what we're all doing the stuff

442
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
And now we know from this

443
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
One paper that

444
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,384
It's very very easy to turn up

445
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Spray lining

446
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
Yeah it change change everything because a group of scientists are taking well maybe we really need to go back and Rihanna

447
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
Investigate some of the key findings in our feet like all them high power replication so you're just kind of doing the same thing but

448
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
More people so they start doing these studies with bigger sample sizes and with strict rules about what data you were looking at

449
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
Say hi to find exactly what they're going to do and how they're going to analyze data

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
So you know there's

451
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,288
No possibility of monkeying around

452
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
2

453
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Get the answer you want

454
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:44,480
Any attempts to replicate or reproduce no major findings in social psychology

455
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
And after

456
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
Panic that went along with it

457
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
Came to be known as

458
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
The replication crisis

459
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
The Cornerstone of science

460
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
News articles

461
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Are talking about

462
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
The reproducibility crisis

463
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
Ensign like oh man

464
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
What's your what is going on here

465
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
Because as they re-examine some of these studies

466
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
The facial feedback

467
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,104
But he's got lots of coverage in newspapers and magazines

468
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
He pardoned today involves

469
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Some of these replications

470
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Where

471
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,576
Feeling specifically what got me reeling it's covering the replication crisis was

472
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
News about ego depletion

473
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,464
So this is a whole literature of studies that were all about

474
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
How we sort of use up

475
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Our willpower

476
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Original studies

477
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
You going to a lab in your presented with a

478
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
A dish of delicious fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies I love the method section of that paper they described baking the cookies in the lab

479
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Set up a snail would be

480
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Around the subject when they come in

481
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,224
And they they put these cookies on it so you can't have any cookies

482
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
And then they leave you alone with a cookies and what I found was that you know if someone has to sit there resisting a cook

483
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
Cookie with it right in front of them in the smell is walking up their nose as they sit there if they have to go through that it'll actually be much

484
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Harder for them

485
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Complete certain kinds of logic

486
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,960
In the argument was he use willpower on Dino task a

487
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,568
Then you try to do tasks be and you just won't have a store will power unless

488
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
Later studies found you drink some lemonade in the meantime because sugar the argument goes replenishes your willpower

489
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,064
Increasingly bizarre elaborations of this original Theory

490
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
It ended up working with M&Ms ended up working with cookies

491
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Over the years dance has this idea that you use of willpower one place and have less than another just started entering all

492
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,120
Three corners of Our Lives the inside of that original study was

493
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
Replicated again and again and again for deca

494
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
But then this group of scientist get this massive

495
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
Effort to replicate the original study

496
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
They had over 2000

497
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Subjects

498
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
They follow these rigorous rules about like what day they were going to look at this is as rigorous a replication is

499
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
As you can get

500
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
And they just found

501
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Like no offense

502
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Basically no affair

503
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,512
Brake brake system understand like how is it the dark that they're finding

504
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
Nothing now but before they had a study that was then replicated

505
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
A bunch of times in a bunch

506
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Labs

507
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Look what I still don't get

508
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
What's

509
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,800
So so you have that original cookies

510
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,896
I think it's notable that no other studies that I know of used cookies

511
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456
Now I found studies were M&M's where use

512
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
So

513
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,576
That just makes me wonder I have no idea how that

514
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Lab to their study

515
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,976
It makes me wonder what would happen if I ran a lab and I wanted to reproduce

516
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Does cookie find

517
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
Standing in a New Direction and I kept trying it with cookies and it just never worked

518
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Let me try it with

519
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
Charleston Chews

520
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Doesn't work because it's not hard to resist

521
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Yeah

522
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
Baby Charleston shoes

523
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,664
Are not good candy and I end up in like I do with M&Ms and it works

524
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,480
Boom there's my dissertation I publish a paper out of it

525
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,320
So now that's in literature and so now ego depletion seems like an even

526
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,952
Stronger more valued thing because it's not just about cookies now it's about cookies are M&M's

527
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
My point is that you don't really know how many things were tried and each individual lab do you think that might be

528
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
What's happening in these Labs is that there's a lot of

529
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Trial and error in the heroes or swept

530
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Decide

531
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
And the successes

532
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Are offered up and then suddenly you have one more success that bolsters the idea is that what you think might be happening I think so

533
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
That is

534
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
The heart

535
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,184
Whatever the problems are not with those follow-up studies the big thing was that scientists work continuing to fail

536
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Hell at replicating these

537
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
Bigen in Fairly well-known

538
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
Studies like the

539
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
The idea that when you smile it

540
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Changes your mood or

541
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Start

542
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Free

543
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Notoxlife

544
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,800
The idea presented in one of the most watched

545
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
TED Talks ever that the way you sort of

546
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
Hold yourself or stand

547
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
Yourself big

548
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Stretch out

549
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,344
The idea that that could have a measurable impact on your behavior or even your hormone levels

550
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,464
That one also failed to replicate that kept happening with study after study and of course

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
The other people come back and say all the Wrecker

552
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
Application effort wasn't done right or you didn't really design it well you're seeing a lot of the researchers

553
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
Who have made their career studying certain effect

554
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
They're just

555
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Not budging

556
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
Few of them are but most of them are not budging so

557
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
You just have a split for a man

558
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:35,040
Iowan researcher describe to me a second civil war was in social psychology

559
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
Estates of stereotypes

560
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Threat

561
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Now

562
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
Itself under threat is it one of these

563
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
Bodies of research being we thought well

564
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,816
No one has yet done the big multi-site

565
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
Pre-registered

566
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,472
Replication that they did for ego depletion the one that like really woke me up to this

567
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,568
But Dan says there have been sort of smaller-scale here and they're kind of attempt

568
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
To replicate some of the studies and

569
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,432
You know some of those had failed some studies came out to

570
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Found it

571
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
You know what

572
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,088
I tried to redo I tried to do the stereotype threat thing on a big group of students

573
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
And I found it sometimes

574
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,000
The opposite happen when I try to induce stereotype threat the students did better

575
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
It's a beautiful day

576
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,400
Will let me let me say this maybe this

577
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
Wealthier I fix this is something

578
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,824
You know I thought a lot about in the very beginning when we talked about all this

579
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Couple things

580
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
First of all

581
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
This research has been dramatically well replicated

582
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Stereotype

583
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Threat effect has been demonstrated

584
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
Way more times and way more

585
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Send really any of those

586
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Psychology

587
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
Study zone of this another

588
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
It is another phenomenon it has

589
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Mapreduce so many demonstrations

590
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
And

591
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
If you can't replicate

592
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
One of them

593
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Six of them

594
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
I don't know I wouldn't

595
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
I would that doesn't surprise me

596
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
He says you know you can even see the failures that's just information about where the effect really applies and where

597
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Where does this is science

598
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
Gradually getting sophisticated enough

599
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
To help

600
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Applied inappropriate places

601
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,904
For example he says he would only expect the effect to appear

602
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,208
At times when the person is really invested

603
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
What they're trying to do

604
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Linda's the negative stereotype

605
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Really

606
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Threatening

607
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
On top of that he says

608
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,424
The kinds of stereotypes that are actually threatening to a given group

609
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Might change

610
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:35,104
Overtime if you just exactly replicated what we did 25 years ago I'm I'm not sure that the

611
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Stimuli and that procedures would have the same meaning

612
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
What's today's

613
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
College students

614
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
That they had been

615
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Delete your social psychology

616
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
The meanings come from the

617
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
Contemporary moment the way the state of the culture at that time

618
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Jimmy that is interesting actually

619
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,304
That is what this research is doing is studying like an individual's

620
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Relationship to life

621
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Threaten like

622
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
That's going to be different

623
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,544
Anyone who you are because you're going to find different things threatening where you are or even when you are

624
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Yeah I don't have I don't

625
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
I think I know enough

626
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
About

627
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Quote the cultural

628
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Black students

629
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Today versus

630
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
The cultural

631
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Black students 25 years ago

632
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
But it wouldn't surprise me

633
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
That there is some real difference

634
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
So I don't put as much stock

635
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
In the exact replication of

636
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Experiment A or B

637
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Yes I do

638
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
In the

639
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Conceptual replication

640
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,448
Is it possible I mean you mentioned there just hundreds of studies that

641
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,544
Kind of foggy circle around the same idea in different ways

642
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
That is

643
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Artspace very compelling

644
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Evelyn

645
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Patapan on This Is Us

646
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Robust phenomenon

647
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:51,648
But the same time you know there's people who gather all the data together and they say look you know maybe there's some kind of bias

648
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,976
Lips in when people are genius resources they just keep

649
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
Trying different versions until they

650
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Get

651
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Something that looks like a results

652
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
Does that seem plausible to you

653
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
Boy that's a deeply

654
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
I guess cynical

655
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Account of

656
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
I was scientific

657
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
Literature this big

658
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
It would seem

659
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
It doesn't seem highly probable to me

660
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:27,488
Is clearly real or applicable under these circumstances we just because they're not everything

661
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
Doesn't mean they're not

662
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Incredibly important to

663
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
To the progress of this

664
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Society

665
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,472
Stereotype threat is pretty unique in the fact that many of the

666
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
Studies in this literature are not just in the lab

667
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,104
They've been taken out into the streets with

668
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
The real people

669
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
That's really where the

670
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,736
You know the tire meets the road is can you actually move

671
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
The

672
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Educational performance

673
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Of real people

674
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
In real

675
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
School situation

676
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,976
Jean-Claude actually sent us a list of several dozen studies

677
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,072
Showing that that interventions designed to reduce stereotype threat

678
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Can have

679
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Traumatic

680
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
And long-lasting effects on achievement

681
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
Now we should say there was at least one case

682
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Are there was a study done in 2000

683
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,336
6 that a researcher try to replicate in 2011

684
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
This is much smaller

685
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
I'm the original

686
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
2069 just last year

687
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
You did it again with more students this time

688
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
I got

689
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Pretty much nothing

690
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,184
This is the same guy in the same school system trying to do the same study

691
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,584
With you know hundreds and hundreds of kids and he came up with nothing serious to know Lehman given that replication is become a cop

692
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,888
Conversation that you have to unfortunately contend with

693
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
I'm just curious if it

694
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Change your opinion of the work

695
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
No

696
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
I don't think there's anything

697
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
This whole thing is not true

698
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
I mean

699
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,784
I want the truth out there more than I want anything else

700
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,184
This is Steve Spencer he was in early collaborator with Claude Steele especially on those studies involving women and math test

701
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
I did recognize

702
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,792
In some of the critiques real issues that we need to deal with

703
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,936
But Steve like Claude is very confident in in the results of his studies in the effect

704
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,312
Of the stereotype threat in general so much so that I'm writing right now and article

705
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
Where I'm going to disclose every single study I've ever done what the results are input the data up for everybody.

706
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
I will admit

707
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,600
To the questionable research practices that I've done

708
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
And

709
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
Be as forthcoming and honest with everything in my own lab

710
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:41,376
In addition to doing that I've entered into an adversarial collaboration it's called which just means he's going to do

711
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:47,520
Big scale reproduction study with people who have serious doubts about whether stereotype threat is real

712
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,360
You know I can't say I haven't time what my reaction will be

713
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
I think what I can promise is that I will take

714
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
The findings very serious

715
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,808
And I will do my utmost not to be defensive about

716
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,976
Are you nervous about this I mean it's looks the stakes are pretty awesome I mean

717
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
You know

718
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
What you mean the stakes are high

719
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,192
I mean I'm a full Professor I have 10-year real steaks for me in this

720
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Not really much

721
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,568
But will not everyone in the field is

722
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Handling these

723
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
These kinds of niggling doubt

724
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,224
Sowell there so many pieces of evidence that things are not alright

725
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
This again is Michael inslicht the professor from Toronto

726
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
2

727
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Alba face

728
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Squid

729
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
Dr. The probability the likelihood

730
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
That all this might have been for naught

731
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Or much of it

732
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Vitamin for nausea

733
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
It's a loss of meaning

734
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,592
What was I doing good work with the contribute to knowledge

735
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
I would have part of the problem

736
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
Weather

737
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
No signal

738
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
I think the effect is Ino

739
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
It might be there

740
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
But it might be so small as to not be

741
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Naughty meaning clean parts

742
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
How to say I know it's hard to know where to

743
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
And on this

744
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
Well one thing that you know

745
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
To make clear is it stereotype

746
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
You really damaging it mean having someone tell you

747
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
You suck at something when you're under

748
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
The gun to do it

749
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
That's always going to

750
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
You know that's going to happen effect I guess the question is

751
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
How you know

752
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
What affected

753
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Exactly

754
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
And when

755
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
And how and why

756
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
What can you do about it and

757
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
And those

758
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
Things feel like maybe

759
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,080
I guess it feels like the part of me that wanted this

760
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Be a kind of

761
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Very simple fix

762
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
That would work everywhere answer

763
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
Save the world

764
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
You know that part

765
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Bleeding Out feeling a little bit

766
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
Lot like wearing the

767
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
This whole thing is shrinking

768
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah totally

769
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
It does feel a weird little girl growing up a little bit

770
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
Is it you kind of have to walk away from the those big simple promise

771
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Yeah maybe that's

772
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,424
Exactly what you need in order to be able to find the smaller place

773
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
This is for you

774
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
And have an effect

775
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
