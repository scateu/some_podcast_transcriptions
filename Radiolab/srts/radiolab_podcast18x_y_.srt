1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
Gonads episode 3

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Emily Webster

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:29,184
Hello hello are you still there I'm still here and this is my mother Mary Webster

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
But but it's another bedbugs are such a freaking pain vacuum

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
All the baseboards at the vacuum the floor is yet to vacuum the door jambs cuz they crawl up the walls and they're trying to get away

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,360
That sounds awful so I recently called my mom for

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
I guess the ketchup but also I had to work question

11
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
That's been bugging me

12
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
What's on my mind

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,680
So I asked her mom working on the story and it made me wonder what you would have named me if I was

14
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Boy

15
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
You would have been named Daniel

16
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
Dad always like

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Name

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,152
And if we ever had a boy

19
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
That's what you want

20
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
Yeah cuz he didn't want to Junior

21
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
He wanted to Daniel he wanted a little Danny

22
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,160
Instead he got a Judy Chrissy Peggy and Molly

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
Father Mike lucky father

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
If you had come out boy you would have been

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
All of us

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,264
Now we wait Daniel for a boy that's for everybody ready

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Yeah well we didn't know when a boy came out as we could have

28
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Gaming

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,624
So this is just going to sound ridiculous but I called my mom because

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
All the stories that we've been doing in the series

31
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
They do make you think about fate

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,888
But even if you think about the first one where they're the primordial germ cells

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
And they're holding on to all sorts of

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
Possibilities in futures

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
And then

36
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Chromosome step in

37
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
No more Infinity

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
You're just like shunted onto

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Appass

40
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
I guess I I guess it I guess asking my mom about Daniel was just like a clumsy way

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,840
Of getting back to what feels like a really pristine Moment Like a moment where

42
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
No decision

43
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Heaven

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,008
Where you exist totally unblemish by life and choice in fate

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Unless

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Maybe life isn't so faithful

47
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Case in point

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
David zarkower

49
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,392
Hello hi. I'm just going to make sure I don't like cracking people but I'll just correct you my name is is pronounce Hazard cover

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Is there coover W right on my head

51
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
I pronounce it with that I like a V it's it's

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Ascension polish

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
That's good

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
And you work at the University of Minnesota

55
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
What do you do there

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Genetics cell biology and development

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
That's that seem scary

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
This Broad

59
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
Anyways the reason I called is Arc

60
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,832
Culver was because I came across the series of experiments that he did that

61
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Just straight-up kicked me in the gonads

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,952
Okay so to begin this was

63
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Back in the

64
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,120
Early 1990s is that cover was working a lab doing genetic stuff in worms and flies and

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
And my something

66
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
And Presto we got lucky

67
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
He and his team discovered a brand-new Gene

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,992
Dmrt1 dmrt1

69
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
I keep trying to say DRM.

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Very sorry for that

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Interesting

72
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Was at the gym with in mice but also

73
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Humans

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
And

75
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
In the mailman

76
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
It was expressing itself in the

77
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Testis

78
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
Can I say it

79
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Testicle Festival

80
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Is that a single

81
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
Okay so yes we found this Gene and humans had it

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
In the testis

83
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
And the question we had was

84
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,927
Weather was doing something or not like you got jeans in your eyes that are making chemicals that are making your eyes

85
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
The color they are

86
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
This Gene dmrt1 is it doing

87
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
We want to know if it's involved in maybe making

88
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
Sperm or maybe just hangs around it doesn't matter doesn't do anything

89
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
You know we don't know

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
So do you like Alexa

91
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Mess around with it

92
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
And see what happens

93
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
But

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
You can't do that experimenting humans so instead

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,295
Some adult male mice perfectly normal fertile males

96
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
Can we use

97
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
And so basically genetics

98
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
They cut the gene out

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,607
And then they take a slice of the testis and they look at it under the mat

100
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
And

101
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
I didn't look like

102
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
What we would have expected

103
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,103
In what they expect to see is that these are the cells that help make sperm in the testis

104
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
And normally they're kind of talk

105
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Hall and lean

106
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Long and skinny

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
But suddenly

108
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
They're different

109
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
With dmrt1 gone they have gotten smaller

110
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
Rounder

111
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
Inzer cover was like Snot something was supposed to happen

112
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
What is going on here

113
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
What are these things

114
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
Then he realized it's a

115
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
The cells are making estrogen and he was like

116
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Oh

117
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,311
I think what is happening is that the cells in the testis

118
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Turn into ovary cells

119
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Wait what

120
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Where's the male Mouse

121
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Yes

122
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
So you're saying this mail Mouse now has

123
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Ovary cells and it's testicles

124
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
Yes that's these are cells that are changing their their sex

125
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
Nothing saying can I come we just have like a

126
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
Exclamatory moment like where you where you think that's possible that happen what is you know

127
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
What do you say

128
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
Press anyway the greatest of all scientific

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Exclamations is

130
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
That's weird

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
I'm so we had it that's weird Moana

132
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
And just to take

133
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
This weirdness like one step further

134
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
A group of scientists did similar

135
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
Experiment in adults

136
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Female mice

137
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
Were they did like the same

138
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Only this time they knocked out a female

139
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Jean in the ovary

140
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
And when I went to look at it over is trying to

141
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
Kyrie organize itself into

142
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Potestas

143
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Wait

144
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
You sing in both cases

145
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
There's one gene it's flipping the sex

146
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
From male to female and back

147
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Yes

148
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
1 G

149
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
One gene

150
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
How many teeth do we have in our body

151
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
I don't know like

152
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Tens of thousands

153
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
I just wanted to

154
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Witches

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,743
Weird concept to think of because we typically connect

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
XXR gonads

157
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Two chromosomes least I do like an a

158
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
X in a y

159
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
Right girl and a boy so how could Gene step in

160
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,007
And reverse that cuz I thought

161
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Genes are these

162
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Like massive thing

163
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
When she is so tiny

164
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,687
Ginger tiny chromosomes are much bigger and I think the answer to that is that

165
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
When you

166
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Get down to sex

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Like what makes us one sex or the other

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
It's not

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
It doesn't work exactly like we thought I take for example the X&Y idea

170
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Dislike

171
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
Chromosomal narrative we have a biological sex

172
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
It's a specific way of thinking about things from a certain moment

173
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
In history that we are

174
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Actually starting to rethink

175
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
I think it's helpful to

176
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Ceaser Tyvek

177
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
The history of how we understand

178
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
Sex in in a in a longer

179
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
So let me bring in this guy I'm David page

180
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
Biology professor at MIT

181
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Where do we start

182
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,767
Oh my gosh well we're going to go so let's see we could go off the rails and any number of direct

183
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
It's your old father to be quite

184
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Play productive but footsie

185
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
So let's go back

186
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
2

187
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
The 1890s

188
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Yeah that definitely is 1890s

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
So

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,431
So genetics was in its infancy Mendel peas

191
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
All that was happening

192
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
And people have been

193
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Conjuring

194
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
For millennia

195
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Where do boys and girls

196
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Now it came to how you look people. Mom and dad

197
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Clearly info

198
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Because people have realized

199
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:07,327
You know the children ended up growing up looking something like their mother and their father

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
Like maybe you have a chin like your dad and nose like your mom and a hair that's a little bit of both

201
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Blending

202
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Of mom and dad to make you

203
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
It right

204
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
But

205
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
When it came to why you where the sex you were

206
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
That

207
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
Was a mystery

208
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Because there was no funding

209
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
You ended up being like

210
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Either

211
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Your mother or your father

212
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
One or the other

213
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
It must not have anything to do with

214
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Reddit it had to be

215
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Post

216
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
From the outside in

217
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,703
So people came up with all kinds of ideas for what made you

218
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
A boy or girl

219
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
The phase of the moon

220
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
At this moment

221
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
Conception cold Dark Moon definitely a girl

222
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
The state of the

223
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,711
The economy surprise down economy girl

224
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Everything that was bad

225
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
Was given two women are there was what the mother ate mom's body heat

226
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
Stress all sorts of crazy things and then

227
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
1923

228
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
We started looking

229
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Elsewhere

230
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
But how do we inherit our character

231
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Friend answer

232
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Chromosome

233
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Chromosome

234
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Chromosome

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
Determine our physical appearance

236
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
And our sex

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,431
In 1923 a scientist looking down the barrel of a microscope discovered

238
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Two new chromosome

239
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Send X and A Y

240
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Call the sex promo

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
But I just want to hit pause here okay

242
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,719
I came to find out for Ashley from David page that the X and Y chromosomes

243
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
Do not look like an X and Y

244
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Like a letter so no no

245
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
No know when they first discovered them

246
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Under the microscope they just look like these

247
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Shaping

248
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Clumps

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Yard sale

250
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Kidney bean

251
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
DX look bigger the white

252
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,711
Smaller but that's it that's so interesting because there's something about the shape of the Exon the shape of the White Witch

253
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Read agendered

254
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Letters that feel so yeah

255
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Penis lights

256
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
There's like a duality or something in the acts which feels like you know ovaries in breast

257
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
After something like there is like

258
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,607
There is something about those letters so I was totally shocked when he was like

259
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
There's no real reason they got those letters it was totally arbiter

260
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Anyways

261
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,079
When they found these chromosomes XX

262
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Two X chromosomes

263
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
You would develop is

264
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Gmail

265
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Anatomic female and if you had a y chromosome

266
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
So you're XY

267
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
That's right

268
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
A boy

269
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
That was the thinking

270
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
Rodger and Susan

271
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
But then

272
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
That idea

273
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
I got more

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
When did you intersect with this story

275
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
The summer of 1979

276
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
Pages at MIT first year of medical

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
School and the

278
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
TNA Revolution

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
So far tonight we've been bringing you news

280
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
The world around us

281
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Was just

282
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Beginning

283
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Now we have news app

284
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Incredible World

285
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Insider

286
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
He was involved in what he describes as like

287
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,999
Precursor to the Human Genome Project what would be

288
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Human Genome Project

289
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,143
Working with the group of senior scientists who work envisioning

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
Maps of the human genome

291
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Encyclopedia

292
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Will know the complete set of instructions

293
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Which made people

294
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,943
And we began to look back at some exceptional human individuals

295
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,015
Who had not been understood previously

296
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Bat saliva test

297
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Women

298
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Revealed that Maria how to set up

299
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
X and Y chromosomes

300
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Who had an X and A Y

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Like most men

302
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Women usually have a pair of x

303
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
And they're also looking at men

304
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
Penis testis chromosomes

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Appear to be those

306
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Typical of a female

307
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
XX

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,127
And 4 Page another scientist they're like oh there must be something more Happening Here than just like the

309
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Chromosome there must be something

310
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Deeper going on here

311
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
So we might actually be on the

312
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Trail

313
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Of

314
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
The secret

315
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,647
So scientists across the world start looking at these peoples chromis

316
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
And what we found was that

317
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
View XY females

318
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
We're actually missing

319
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
A little bit of the Y chromosome

320
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
But these XY women

321
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
A little bit of the Y

322
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Wasn't there

323
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
Of the Y that the XY females

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
We're missing

325
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
Was the same bit that was present

326
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
In the XX

327
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Meaning somehow

328
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,599
A little bit of the Y chromosome had gotten onto one of the exes

329
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Abby's XX males

330
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
And so

331
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Who is becoming

332
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Very clear

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
That

334
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
This must

335
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Fitbit that matter

336
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
And around 1990

337
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
Avenues this day scientists say they've made a major Discovery scientist

338
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
In Britain announced they'd found this one gene

339
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
On the Y chromosome

340
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
The genetic

341
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
Trigger on the Y chromosome that determines whether a baby will be a boy

342
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Or girl

343
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,343
What they found is that of the 200 genes on the Y chromosome there was this one

344
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
Single Gene that acted as

345
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
The switch

346
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
The master switch the grand master switch

347
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Which determines the child's sex

348
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
So it's not X and Y as a whole

349
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
It's one tiny piece

350
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
So

351
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Back in the first episode

352
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
There were those primordial germ cell

353
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,807
Add to go on that super long journey to get to the gonads

354
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Cathedral

355
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
And

356
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,951
On the journey when they got to the cathedral they were full of potential

357
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
I think it'd be anything

358
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
Female like being female that could be whatever your version of anything is

359
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
And then when they get there

360
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
There's a moment where

361
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Fate stepped in and just

362
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Schleich

363
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
Swept all their possibility away and said you are one thing

364
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
This is the thing you will be

365
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
This Gene is

366
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Baked

367
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Christian the scientist

368
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Discovered if it shows up

369
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Then you shoot off down the path that is

370
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Testis

371
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Mail

372
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
And if it doesn't show up

373
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
You shoot down the path of egg

374
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Ovary female

375
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
And the scientist

376
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
Davis Jean a name

377
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Sry

378
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
It is like

379
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Sorry

380
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
Like your man sorry

381
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,295
So it sounds like we've gone from like crazy ideas about what makes

382
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
A boy or a girl to

383
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Chromosomes to now like

384
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
This little Jean

385
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,279
Yeah but the the sry gene that you just mentioned is different than the gene that

386
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
I just heard about from

387
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Is there a cover

388
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Is there coover

389
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
Recovery up stack over Noah's Ark

390
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
Is a different Gene than sry but this

391
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
This is what's so crazy about dmrt1

392
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Okay

393
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Primordial germ

394
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
There any embryo

395
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
The waiting to become something

396
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
And then sorry

397
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
But just comes on for about a day

398
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
And then

399
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
It goes away

400
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
But once it turns on it then starts the Psych cast

401
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Skade of

402
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
Gene Gene after Gene that all sort of

403
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,359
And what all of these genes do is create chemicals that send out signals that start

404
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
Forming and shaping

405
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
The test

406
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
And

407
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
As soon as the test is begins to develop

408
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
Unturned support G

409
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Dmrt1

410
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
DeckOver stain is important for finishing the job of making a testis

411
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Make the tattoo turn off

412
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
But dmrt1 doesn't go away at that point

413
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
It stays active

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Forever

415
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,359
In the womb when the testis is just growing and then when you're born and through

416
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,711
You know childhood or teenage years adulthood like until you die

417
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Dmrt1 is on

418
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,855
And if you take it away like sark overdid

419
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
The cell will actually

420
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Change sex

421
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Which would lead you to believe that

422
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
Dmrt1 is actually preventing a

423
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Sal from switching sex

424
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
I called

425
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
Who is a geneticist from our first episode

426
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Explain the

427
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
What all this means

428
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,199
Is that that other past the past that you did not take in the gonad Cathedral

429
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
It never went away

430
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
It's actually still there

431
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
You carry it with you always

432
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,415
It's just that that Gene has been shushing it

433
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Yeah

434
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Wait I'm repressing the other pathway my whole life

435
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Like I think we think so

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Yeah really

437
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,679
Yeah there's like a parallel universe male Molly yes

438
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
I think there is there's a parallel universe male male

439
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Wait when you say this Gene has been shutting the other Molly what's that even mean

440
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
Okay so you can think of it like this

441
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
The code for that other Molly

442
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Uncle Daniel

443
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
That code is still

444
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
In myself

445
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,999
And zharkova says it what does Gene does is it sort of one of the things this Gene does a sort of

446
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
Trolls and make sure that Daniel jeans don't turn on

447
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,215
Basically what does genes been doing it turns out as playing whack-a-mole basically just going around and being like Daniel

448
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Daniel Nowak

449
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
And it doesn't maybe every day

450
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
It's like an election that's always being kind of

451
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Challenged

452
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
That's where why cast

453
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
The deciding vote

454
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
And male happened

455
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
But

456
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Does recount

457
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Every now and then

458
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
And

459
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
15 Martie 1

460
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,391
Not there to say nope still mail then

461
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
You can go the other way

462
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
So now I understand why you're so

463
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,119
Obsessed with Daniel because it's not just an idea he's like trying to get out and it does go

464
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Both ways like like

465
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
If you know there's sry and there's

466
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Dmrt1

467
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
But they

468
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
I found these key jeans in ovaries that you can

469
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
On and off

470
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Some more results

471
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Why would our bodies be set up this way

472
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Make you think once a decision gets made

473
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
That you just

474
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Make that decision and be done with it

475
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
There always be the possibility of unmaking

476
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
That is a good question

477
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
I will answer that after break

478
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
But first

479
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
I'm going to call my sisters

480
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
This is Kayla Caldwell calling from Sunny Austin Texas

481
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Radiolab presents

482
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463

485

Additional support for Radiolab

487
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519

Foundation

489
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,687
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

490
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,551
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

491
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

492
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,280
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

493
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Brilliance

494
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,120
Basically I want to hear about those times when I

495
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
I kid you know did something

496
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
It just means you read back and say whoa

497
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,616
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

498
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Back to you

499
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,200
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

500
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

501
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,160
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry

502
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
We're interested in the

503
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Specific moments where

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,352
A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

505
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
If you have a story

506
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

507
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
Record a short audio message

508
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
Fan that's radiolab.org / brilliance

509
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Thank you so much

510
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
All right back to gonads

511
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
Emily Webster

512
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Their name or hello

513
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
Okay it's Chrissy

514
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Dude

515
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
Peggy

516
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Hi how are you

517
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
I'm Grace

518
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
And neither my sisters Judy Chrissie and Peggy

519
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Okay so

520
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
So I'm going to tell you guys the same

521
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
It's not even that big of a deal but it's just sort of funny

522
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Oh okay

523
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,464
No no I just want to tell you about some reporting that I've been doing and then a funny thing that Mom and Dad told me

524
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
That's all I ask

525
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Mom had an affair

526
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
No no God no

527
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,728
Just Chrissy this is ridiculous

528
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,848
The third episode is basically about how we all carry in US

529
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Like the APA

530
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Opposite self

531
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
That we never became

532
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
So

533
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
So I called Mom

534
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Cuz I was like what would mail

535
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
Molly have been like like did you guys have like a name for male Molly

536
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,000
And they were like oh we would have called you Daniel

537
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
That was what they were supposed to call me they were so desperate to use Daniel it turns out that we were all

538
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
All supposed to be called Daniel

539
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Reveal

540
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,336
It's not dinner Daniel Webster

541
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Has Molly

542
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,576
Oh man are you surprised that your name would have been Daniel Webster that you would have been a Daniel

543
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
No I'll do that right

544
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,464
Peggy. I just know that I don't feel like

545
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,864
My inner Daniel Webster would have that much of a different life than I have so

546
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,984
I think you guys honestly not to Railroad this conversation but I think you guys want you out because

547
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
I was the one that was raised with a hoop that there was like some Daniel lingering in me isn't Daniel Webster like a famous

548
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Sudan history yes

549
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,992
I took a picture of a statue of him once

550
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
Send it to dad because I was supposed to be the annual

551
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Who is Daniel Webster

552
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
She's a boring white dude

553
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Of course he is

554
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,280
We knew that part he served as senator for Massachusetts and was the under Secretary of State

555
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,608
Under three presidents.

556
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,960
I think it's just a regular irregular like old white lawyer dude

557
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Now they're all racist

558
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
Thor ages tour

559
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Douchebag

560
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,600
Sorry well

561
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
All right that's all that's all I got

562
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
I love you guys love you

563
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Bed bug

564
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,752
Okay

565
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Circuit everybody app

566
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
We have learned that we are all carrying around with us

567
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
Another path

568
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,736
We all have our own inner Daniel Webster's

569
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
Constantly

570
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
Whatever

571
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
So

572
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,976
My question for zharkova was like why would I carry this path with me if I'm always trying to like a

573
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
If I'm just turning it off

574
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,096
Do you have any answer

575
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
I wish I had the answer so we don't really have an answer

576
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
It could be as boring as

577
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
What doesn't really matter because normally no molecular Genesis comes in hacks out to Mirchi one or turns on foxtel to or what

578
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm so

579
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
Why solve a problem you haven't created that that's

580
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Quite possible but boring

581
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
The more

582
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Interesting

583
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
Answer is that this is an evolutionary holdover from

584
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
From a common ancestor with fish

585
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,632
So this ancestor would be our great

586
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Grandparents 16

587
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,288
Which means 400 million years ago a fish

588
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:26,944
Swam out of the depths of the ocean crawled onto land and took like

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,344
Squelching steps forward and boredom boredom boredom for through millions of years lock and key

590
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,672
Chance and fate until finally getting to

591
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
You and me

592
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,376
Hello hello can you hear me yes can you hear me

593
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Bob my name is Bob Horner I'm a research Professor studies Evolution and marine biology

594
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,336
Santa Barbara what's your trash into the ocean

595
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Wealthy

596
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Hole

597
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,992
Idea that there is a different world under there

598
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
I'm just going to Adam Brothers. Of this

599
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,000
So down in the waters around the Florida Keys their swims

600
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
A remarkable fish to head wraps it is a very common coral reefs

601
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
Fish this is Marshall Phillips graduate student at North Carolina State University like Bob studies blue heads

602
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
Anyways down in the keys are some Primo spots and ice patches of reef

603
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,600
Group of say a dozen blue head in that group there will be

604
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
Single large brightly colored male with a blue head

605
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
And it's shiny blue green body and it has white and black stripes right behind its head

606
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
The go black white black that we very technically called the Oreo and if he's got a big Oreo well

607
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,128
Gmail

608
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
And then the rest of the group is essentially a harem of ladyfish

609
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
The lady in the group are little and yellow or pretty kind of swim a little slower watching out for

610
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
Birthing email starting all around

611
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,936
And this Harem of females will basically spend their entire lives on this one

612
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
Where they make every day with that one male the male and the female

613
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:36,736
Will Dartmouth in the water column together and then at the same time he'll release his sperm and she'll release her egg

614
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
Xfinity dark right back down and then a different female same nail go up eggs firm

615
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
And then again different female every day

616
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,168
Over and over

617
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Say something happens

618
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
To this mail

619
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,080
Jose a predator comes along and he jumps that mail

620
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,408
So the alpha male

621
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Gone

622
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
Now the question is what happens to the ladies you think it would be chaos because their whole system's been thrown out of whack but

623
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Within

624
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Minutes to hours

625
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
Life

626
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Find a way

627
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Somehow

628
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
The ladies pic

629
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
Who will be the next male have it pretty well worked out who's the largest

630
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,664
Each other like you don't line up or anything more than you know

631
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
But somehow they

632
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Figure it out

633
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,040
Until Wednesday establish who the largest female is

634
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,368
She starts to change her behavior

635
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,024
She gets a little more friendly towards the other females just swim up to them do this little weekly dance started waving her

636
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
Pectoral fin at the ladies

637
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,912
Isn't really something they do as a female ever

638
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
And then as time goes on her body starts to change she will get a little bit bigger

639
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
How do you just suddenly get bigger testosterone for brain starts sending signals to produce tongue

640
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,392
The testosterone testosterone is is taking over and a she starts to grow

641
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
A little bit of blue starts to appear right adornos her scale start to change color then sort of spread backwards

642
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
Right at her chin and spread outwards until her head is entirely blue and then these darkstripe

643
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Right start to form

644
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,312
Those will eventually become that black white black Oreo

645
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
And the other thing that starts to happen is her ovaries start to disintegrate

646
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
These are the most valuable cells in the body and now suddenly they're being

647
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,464
Destroyed and then they start to rebuild themselves into testes

648
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,560
Let's start producing sperm really rapidly

649
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Wow

650
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
It is not

651
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
It's absolutely incredible

652
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
And then

653
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,336
Sex causes back new dominant male at the top of the Heap

654
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
But at first you not very good at being a male like he doesn't quite know when to Dart up and windows

655
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,856
Spawn stress like a teenager who doesn't know how to talk to girls but eventually

656
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,184
You get the hang of it and can produce baby blue heads

657
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
The cycle of

658
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Life

659
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Continue

660
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
Is it good Attenborough thank you

661
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
That's crazy that they just

662
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,568
Disintegrate their insides and then rebuild but the funny thing is if you ask Bob about this stuff

663
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
In fact

664
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,176
About how these little lady fish completely transform he's like

665
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,808
Yeah I hate to admit that but yeah it's not that shocking the shocking thing is

666
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
How many

667
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Fishes

668
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Change sex

669
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
It turns out

670
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a lot of fishes

671
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,864
Nearly all the wrasses you blew had your fairies or flashers kush's

672
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,216
They actually look like parrots but most of the big groupers

673
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,520
The tiny gobies dance of fishes

674
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Everyone asked about clownfish

675
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
Finding Nemo just that change sex

676
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
But they do it a little differently from male to female clownfish matriarchy

677
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
It's like

678
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
100 whole lot of sex changing fish

679
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Heasley wow hundred

680
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Skip

681
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
Here's a really crazy thing

682
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
It's not suspicious shrimp

683
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:40,448
Worms alligators if you include all of the animals in which their sex goes a different way than you would think

684
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
Mayflies lobsters

685
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
Bananas

686
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
Lizard Birds muscle snails slugs chickens

687
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Chickens eat frogs

688
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
It's just amazing and Waylon we get to Turtles

689
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,064
It's a whole zoo in this conversation

690
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
So why would fish like why would

691
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
Why would any animal change sex

692
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Well I think

693
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
Sex change

694
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,840
Increases your Fitness you have more young either eggs you produce or eggs that you fertilized

695
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Then you would

696
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
As a

697
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
As a single sex

698
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
In other words

699
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
It just ensures that you can pass on your genetic material

700
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
Like a beer the fishes on the reef and the mail disappears

701
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
We are stuck

702
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
And there's no there's in your DNA goes nowhere

703
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,040
But if you can become a male

704
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,440
You can make sure that your DNA go somewhere and then like all the other fishes in your little

705
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Kingdom go somewhere

706
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
Okay so now let me ask you the next obvious question

707
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
You told me that we come from the sea

708
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
They've got this Lexie sexy thing and the we have it to some degree Daniel lurks within you and is being active

709
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
We suppress every single day

710
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
So can we be like the fish

711
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,224
Yeah it does make you think of that the darkover says that ever since he did those Mouse experiments he gets

712
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
This question a lot

713
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah yeah there's some interest from a transgender community in whether this could be

714
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Something to be helpful

715
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
But

716
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Can't

717
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Do it

718
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
We technically can't

719
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:13,888
Sakura says it's unethical and at this point probably even technically impossible to take that Chino

720
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,776
And even if we could removing a gene just won't physically reorganize us

721
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
In the way the fish do

722
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
He says that most

723
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:28,736
You might be able to produce your own natural sex hormones of the type that's more aligned with your gender identity

724
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
Oh pretty crazy to even get the body to do that

725
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,160
But the reason we can't actually do the full on switch

726
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
Is because

727
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Humans

728
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Male and female humans

729
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Have developed

730
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Internal reproductive

731
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
The plumbing that is

732
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,144
So different from each other

733
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,704
It would be impossible to drop of a hat

734
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
To switch

735
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
Then this this makes me confused

736
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Miguel

737
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Is this

738
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,200
Do use blanche's work from a few episodes ago as it's by potentiality that

739
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Still is there

740
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Latent

741
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Being suppressed

742
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
Is that a legacy thing that is she

743
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,672
Just fading away or is there is it there

744
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
For a reason

745
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
It's there for reason in the fish

746
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Is it there for a reason.

747
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Does it serve a purpose

748
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
And therefore will be that

749
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
Always

750
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Or

751
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Maybe even get stronger

752
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,008
Yeah it's a no I ask Blanche that I don't know

753
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
I don't know I don't have a good answer for that

754
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
But it's

755
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
Do you think anyone does

756
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
Or is this like a

757
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,296
No I don't think anyone does

758
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
I think we're all trying to figure out why would be the case

759
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,720
And most people ask the same question you asked her why would this be true

760
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
And I don't know why it would be true

761
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Even if we don't know why

762
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,984
Just knowing that that other path is there just below the surface

763
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,312
Wanting to express itself

764
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,712
Make you think a different way about how rigidly we Define

765
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Ourselves

766
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
I think we like

767
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,880
The bin people as male or female and we both always

768
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
Put people into piles

769
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
But I think there's a tremendous amount of Middle Ground

770
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
Even when you're just talking about

771
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,472
You know things like the level of testosterone you're making or the level of estrogen you're making or

772
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
The shape of your genitalia or

773
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,616
Many other features that we we we

774
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,200
We've been as male or female I think there is a lot of

775
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
There's a lot of variation between the two piles

776
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
And maybe we just haven't

777
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Appreciated the variation that exist

778
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
