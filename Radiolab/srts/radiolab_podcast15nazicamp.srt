00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
I forgot how on a potato farm

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
Like he thinks we saw live on a farm Garden

20
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Pretty cool

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
So we were talking one day

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,888
And he mentioned very casually as if it's like something we all know he says

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
Yeah back when we had Nazi prisoners-of-war working on our farm

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Nose like timeout what is parenthetical

25
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
Can potatoes and then yeah the Nazi prisoners of War were helping us

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,808
Starting to remember how old I was just buy out all the guards were

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,392
They were very tall he was only 3 or 4 it's

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Burgerrito

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Do you know if there were like

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
The prisoners

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Or just like a

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Info

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Hello there was a bun

34
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
Even know there were prisoners of War

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Masters of war in America

36
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Yeah me neither

37
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Okay yeah so that was the

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
So after I talk to my dad I ended up calling this

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Historian Kathy

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Cuz I wanted to know was this

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Just

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
An Aberdeen thing no

43
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Like you were talking about Idaho

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
She told me in Idaho alone

45
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,088
This Branch camps in Aberdeen and Blackfoot and Emma Taylor and

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
False

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
There were 23 different camp

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
General you had prisoners that were in churches Kent City sand

49
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Rodeo ground dormitories

50
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
High School gym

51
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
And this was the case all across the country

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
The only

53
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
State that did not have prisoners of War

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
At the max

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
We had over 370 1000 Germans

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
51000

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
Italians in 5000 Japanese

58
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
Almost half a million people

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
God why don't nobody know this

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,720
I don't even know it doesn't even like strike a little cord that maybe I once learned about it and

61
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Junior High

62
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
No this was not talked about

63
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
We just don't talk about it we just don't

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
I think we don't

65
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
I don't know

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
But today we are going to talk about it

67
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
And not just physical historical thing but because

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
Raises a question breaking news this Nunes stunning report looking into how the CIA interrogated detainees

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Question that you know

70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
With the torture reports

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
Abu ghraib Guantanamo Bay

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Today which is when you capture Navy Soldier taken out of the battle out of the fight how should you treat

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
That person and it's both sides agreed to follow certain rules and one side doesn't

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
What do you do

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688
An interesting thing was it 70 years ago this question was playing out in this

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Really dramatic way in

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
In all of these towns across America

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
There were about 200 basecamps that were huge they were like

79
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
To 8000

80
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,744
And by the way that's like seventy times the size of Guantanamo Bay currently

81
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Case

82
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
That she was researching Karen sword to zoom into one camp in particular

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
So this is really a Lester tivid what happened

84
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
There's this one camp in Aliceville Alabama

85
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
It's a Tiny Town of like 1500

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
But the camp has

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Thousand

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
I was like four times the size of the town

89
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
So I went and interviewed a bunch of people guards prisoners locals

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
From Aliceville and

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
It was quite a day

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
That's Thomas sweet he worked in Ellisville

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Any told me that the day that the prisoners came to a thousand of them came at first and the police were like nobody is allowed on the

95
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
But of course one word got out that the first

96
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Try and load was coming

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,639
Everybody rushed out on the street today the train come in there wasn't supposed to be any townspeople

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
But the course that was

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,575
Everybody was saying his from 3 years old people

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
70 years old

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,207
So these voices are from an oral history project that was recorded in 1994 about the

102
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
The prison camp analysis

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
So we all kinda Lumbertown

104
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
So that we could

105
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
Liam when they got off the train everybody super nervous

106
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
Debbie's images in their head

107
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,639
Just like a lot of people that was really didn't know what kind of devils was going to get off that train

108
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Guys with horns on their head

109
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
So these prisoners that were sent to Aliceville were actually part of

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
Rommel's Afrika Corps in these guys were the most feared of Hitler

111
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,975
Fighters that were supposed to be the elite

112
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Superman right so if the train pulled up

113
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
They stopped right on the main Highway doors open

114
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
Hundreds and hundreds of German soldiers get out

115
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
And they were marching

116
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
German March

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,271
And they're singing their military songs in German

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
Tell us about forty.

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
What you thought when I got off the

120
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,839
What did they look like when you listen to the oral histories

121
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Really clear that this was a really complicated moment for the people in Aliceville Mayfield owls for Westgate

122
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,127
I didn't know what I was going to be mad at him when they first come in or what but when I seen it it was just a bunch of

123
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
Cryptkins fan with a ceiling off

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
A concern

125
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,647
In our hearts for them

126
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Hey young lady

127
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,255
Haggard looking washed out and meet room.

128
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
And somehow

129
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Mad.

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Grissom you could tell they been to a rough

131
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
It was over

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Food 4 Less

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
That sounds good. He was one of the prisoners stepping out of the train that day

134
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
I've been drafted into the Army against his will and captured in North Africa and then he was sent to America in the

135
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
The bottom of the sea

136
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
Big cargo ship runs in one room

137
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Clouded 700

138
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Pizza

139
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,999
You couldn't even sit there was no toilet of course we had found it

140
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
Tim boxes

141
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
We all love it

142
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
Soapwalla deodorant

143
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,727
Was it awful trip and you kind of

144
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
But on the other hand and you hear this too in the oral histories

145
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
The people in Aliceville are thinking these are Nazis

146
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
These are the men who are killing our son will you know I had three brothers

147
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
I will cease at the same time

148
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
So

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
We didn't like

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
That's just the way we felt

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,023
They said there's that question in people's mind in this is playing out all across the country

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Here's the enemy at your mercy

153
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
What do you do how do you treat them

154
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
They're in your hands nobody's watching

155
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
You can do whatever you want with them at that point in theory

156
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
In practice

157
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
Will actually this was a significant moment

158
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:49,503
For the world I mean 14 years before a bunch of countries have gotten together and they'd made-up rules

159
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
For exactly this kind of moment

160
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
1929 at Geneva

161
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,695
Long before Hitler and his Partners began to lie the real estate of the world

162
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
That was an International Conference

163
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,119
Erin Nations solemnly promise to uphold the rules governing the treatment of prisoners of War

164
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
So it was a series of

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Do's and don'ts

166
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
That's a story in Arnold Kramer he's a professor at 6

167
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
And then some of the rules he says they're pretty basic

168
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
Women and children should be protected

169
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
She had to give prisoners a certain amount of food

170
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
And then there's rules about medical attention labor

171
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Can use people for labor Kathy Kirkpatrick again you also should be paying people for labor

172
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,495
Payment was $0.80 a day the Geneva conventions are this attempt to kind of

173
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,335
Civilize the most uncivilized thing which is war

174
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
The first world war was so horrific

175
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,503
Hundreds of thousands of prisoners died in p o w Camp there were no real regulation

176
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
With regard to prisoners

177
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Besides did almost anything you want

178
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,439
So the Geneva conventions of 1929 was an attempt to kind of set things right

179
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Because people just

180
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Couldn't fathom

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Another

182
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
War 2 end

183
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
We were well-trained and

184
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
The Geneva Convention

185
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,495
Best Thomas sweet again he was actually one of the guards at Camp Aliceville

186
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
And what she said is that

187
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Even before the pows arrived at the Geneva conventions were drilled into their heads they had lectures the rules were

188
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
Posted in the Rec Hall and

189
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:29,343
Officers Club where you had to the prisoners had to be treated the same

190
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
As you would

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Your own fellow soldiers

192
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Which sounds kind of basic

193
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,559
But for somebody like Han to Stepping off this train and wondering how

194
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Is he going to be treated

195
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
I should say it was

196
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
A sort of

197
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Heaven

198
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
When I got into the

199
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
The badge is all been laid out.

200
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Red

201
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Playing

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
They had

203
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,903
Styles and shaving equipment for each one on each other each one's bunk

204
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
The prisoners washed up and then the guards opened up the cafeteria

205
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,375
Then we got to eat good things this is water filter he's another prisoner at Alice

206
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Big heart

207
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Piece of white bread W American white bread

208
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
We got peanut butter

209
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
I didn't know about the

210
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Are peanuts nuts

211
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
And chased it

212
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,223
Wonderful wonderful what's the best thing I ever had

213
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,599
And I think on which times and I think on peanut butter

214
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Here's the funny thing

215
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Did you look into this

216
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,303
You start to realize that we're not just following the Geneva conventions

217
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
The letter of the law we're going up

218
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Above and beyond

219
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
And according to Hans

220
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,031
What started out as a great thing getting all this food ended up to be kind of a

221
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
Problem The Voice came to me everyday

222
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,455
Please tell him we don't want to have so much ham

223
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
And the Saxon came to me who got that

224
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
Don't tell the captain that you're ugly

225
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
Just throw it away now no no no no

226
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Tay Keith

227
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
End

228
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
Make a hole in the sand and put it in the sand

229
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
So

230
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
They buried the hatchet

231
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
And and a lot of it

232
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
That is a lot of the him

233
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Because we didn't know what to do with it

234
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,823
They also didn't like corn but they kept getting corn and so they bury corn

235
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
And then they get caught because corn starts growing

236
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,527
Everyone's like wait a minute bad corn hiding

237
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,719
Within two months they have an orchestra within a year they have three orchestras

238
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,583
This is a p o w LED Orchestra

239
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,703
They're making instruments the locals are donating instruments the YMCA is giving them instruments

240
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
They open a schools

241
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
Youcanlearnanything from Pottery to like mathematics almost any language you want to learn

242
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
They set up correspondence programs with the local universities you can get credit

243
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
About everyday they drew big crowds

244
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
They had a newspaper their newspaper was called the fence to guess and it had like

245
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Poetry

246
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,055
They also did a lot of theatrical production and sometimes through a regular art shows

247
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
This is where things get a little bit strange

248
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
On December 18th

249
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
There was another artist

250
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Exhibition

251
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,063
This is a woman named Ellen vander's whose father was a p o w at the camp

252
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
And here she's reading from his diary

253
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
December 12th

254
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
DEF fuel that means

255
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Hitler

256
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487

257
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303

Exhibition in Camp

00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
. she saying that way

262
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Hitler

Send money to the camp for an art thing

264
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Wow

00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
Why were fighting Hitler he sending money

266
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Why we're fighting Hitler

267
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
While we're fighting Hitler

268
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Really strange

269
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Monday

270
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Coming up the fence gester on fence be buried Amazon buried and the Nazis next door being an argument

271
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
If we're still having to this day

272
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
I'm Tammy Pate from Spencer Indiana

273
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding

More information about Sloan at www.delone.org

277
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

278
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
And I'm here because I need your help

279
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
And I request

280
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

281
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
About what we're calling tiny moments

282
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Brilliance

283
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,335
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

284
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

285
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Maybe it was the moment that I

286
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
Kids started reading back

287
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Do you

288
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

289
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,975
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

290
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,839
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

291
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

292
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Anything to do with the test

293
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
If you have a story

294
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335

Acrylic

302
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Radiolab

303
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Toy Story ears

304
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
So so okay with Hitler's Christmas gift to the art show

305
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
And a ham

306
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,063
In the bands and all that stuff did people in the in the outside the camp know what was going on inside

307
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Once they start so

308
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
I think it was in 19

309
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,023
43 was the point at which we started realizing we're running out of American men to do

310
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Labor and

311
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
We look around and we're like

312
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Actually we have

313
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Quite a few men who might be able to do some work here

314
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Thanking God

315
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Peanuts

316
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:18,431
So some of the farmers would bring them in the house for lunch they would drink with them there were drunk

317
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
There's some really funny stories of like probably moonshine the prisoners getting drunk with the fire

318
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,903
Farmers and then they get in trouble cuz they come home late

319
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
One of the biggest things at the war department says when they start sending the men out is like if you if you make friends with these pows hits

320
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Against the rules

321
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
They do it

322
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
All the time anybody fall in love with anybody

323
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Oh yeah

324
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
I mean not a lot but it definitely happen

325
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
Suit as these prisoners are out in the community and their forming friendships

326
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
A few of them are falling in love where it starts to get out about

327
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,319
How they're being treated and meanwhile Across America there's rationing

328
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
That's when they learned that the

329
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Pows are getting food that they might not be getting

330
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
A lot of the American public

331
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Bigot

332
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Especially this radio guy Walter Winchell

333
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
They calling The Rush Limbaugh of World War II

334
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Supporters in America

335
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Spokane is funny nasal but that's exactly what it sounds like

336
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,487
Find out about the Nazi pure W program Walter Winchell just starts to rant about it

337
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Radio

338
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
And he would do this week after week

339
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Start writing articles in the New York Times

340
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
Tribune the Boston Globe citizen start flooding the war department of letters

341
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,415
I know that y'all YMCA War prisoners Aid

342
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,815
Does all the time in the meantime according to Thomas sweet

343
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Inside the camp some of these

344
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Prisoners are

345
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Starting to get kind of Bolt

346
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,727
For couple night side cutouts wall stickers

347
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Took the title

348
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,175
Flying the Kite had to swap stickers in the box underneath the kite

349
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
With a string that down to the ground

350
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
And they handed the string to one of the

351
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
One of the guards and said

352
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Turles Dragon when they pull the string

353
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
The Trappe door open on

354
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
The gadget that made

355
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
And always

356
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Swastika

357
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
Over the camping in Aliceville to in the townspeople

358
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Started calling the base

359
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Mad about that

360
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
How to that

361
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
We don't have enough men to guard a lot of these camps so so the prisoners are starting to get more and more control of the camp

362
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Presidents heads around as a cat

363
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,135
And some cases the Nazi hardliners would would starts at torment and now I'm not

364
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Threaten them they might be

365
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Beat them up there were even

366
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,303
A couple of murders was not a Nazi inside of you

367
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,935
I'm if you would had been drafted but you didn't you weren't Idol

368
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
So the perception is coming out of these camps

369
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,591
Is that we created these hotels on American soil where Nazis

370
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,919
Could start radicalizing and people get so mad

371
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,783
That there's actually a congressional investigation into the coddling of prisoners of War

372
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:43,231
So I spend a lot of time at the National Archives trying to get to like all right what are the arguments and and here's kind of how it was

373
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
But you have this

374
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Congressman on one side Richard Harless and he saying you're cuddling them

375
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
And on the other side you have

376
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
The guy who's now running the prisoner-of-war program Archer alert and he's basically saying no

377
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,551
Jesus we're just following the Geneva conventions and the reason that he gave was the same reason that Joe Biden would give almost

378
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
60 years later

379
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
There's a reason why we sign these treaties

380
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
To protect

381
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
My son in the military

382
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:20,607
We are torturing them they'll touch that's why we have these trees

383
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
So when Americans

384
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Our capture

385
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
They are

386
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Not

387
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Torture

388
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
That's the reason

389
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Case anybody forgets it

390
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
At 3

391
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
One problem though

392
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
Just one month

393
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,575
After that hearing in 1944

394
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Sound of a machine gun

395
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:48,255
News breaks that 84 American soldiers prisoners of War now in Germany are gunned down

396
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
After they surrendered

397
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
Later that frozen body

398
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
And the mangoes found

399
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Found what I felt then go on to liberate American soldiers from pewww camps in Germany and refine

400
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Nothing like Allah

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,455
American prisoners of War report in human Hospital conditions

402
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Walter Winchell github

403
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:14,111
Airwave

404
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,928
Our generosity

405
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
And olive oil when I treat it

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
By the one side of Geneva Convention rules and if you

407
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
2 months later

408
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Things get even worse

409
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
It was impossible to fully realize the horror of a Nazi concentration camps

410
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
We start going into concentration camps

411
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Germans have done what the Nazis have done

412
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,440
Call sense of dead bodies were piled everywhere. Never having received

413
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,768
The Living Dead

414
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,672
The Congress decides to hold a second investigation into the treatment of prisoners

415
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
But this time it's

416
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Real

417
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
Soul searching I mean we just seen the full horrors of the Holocaust were thinking you know anything we do to these guys

418
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Guys at this point they deserve

419
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
We've also realized we're not really getting rest

420
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Prosody the we don't really have

421
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Medical reason to treat them well anymore

422
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,736
So at this point the question has really become do we continue to be good

423
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
Even when we're not getting anything in return

424
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,928
The kind of amazing thing to me is that we decide yeah

425
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
We're going to stick to the Geneva conventions

426
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,608
Archer alert to Runza pow program at this point he gets up and he says

427
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
We are not going to lower ourselves to Nazi standards we are not going to let the enemy decide Who We Are

428
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Another country

429
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
And that argument stock

430
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah

431
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
I think that most people associated with the prison camp

432
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:19,040
Experience in Arnold Kramer against treated them well not because

433
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
They treated her as well

434
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
But that we are decent people and we probably would have done this anyway

435
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
What makes an American

436
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not any special pressure sort of blood

437
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
But the tradition we have inherited

438
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
It's tradition

439
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Rokblok

440
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
The problem with the way we think

441
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm acting

442
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
There's a great belief

443
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,896
That we have a special mission

444
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
I am we have a special

445
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
History

446
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
This is David Goldfield he's a historian at UNC Charlotte

447
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Now that's the

448
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Baidu

449
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
But

450
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
No

451
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
I mean don't you only have to look

452
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:03,328
At the treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II

453
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
It says don't forget

454
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Right as we're giving the Nazis massive amounts of ham were also rounding up

455
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Tens of thousands of

456
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Japanese American citizen

457
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Citizen

458
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
And we're throwing them into these

459
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Cramps camp

460
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
That are way worse in Aliceville

461
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,760
And if you ask David why are we treating the Germans so much better

462
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
They look like

463
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
These people look all right

464
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
A mailman

465
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
The farmer

466
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
All look pretty much like a back home

467
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
The major reason

468
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Race

469
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
The Germans were white

470
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
They seemed familiar

471
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
But there was

472
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
A connection

473
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
Between the German pows

474
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,336
And the folks in the American South

475
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Not only because of

476
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
The ethnicity of

477
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
The Germans

478
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
Not only because of their economic benefit

479
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
To the region

480
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
David told us that he's looking

481
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
To the historical

482
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Thanks

483
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
The German laws

484
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Eventually

485
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Copy

486
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
From

487
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
The Mississippi

488
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Black Codes

489
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
We couldn't confirm that they were

490
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Literally copy

491
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
But there are

492
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
There are similarities

493
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
A bunch of a fish

494
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
In that time

495
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Praise Southern Raceway

496
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
So

497
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
There was already

498
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Connection

499
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
Between the American South

500
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
And that's a German

501
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
This is the most horrifying thing ever

502
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
Is it really true that like all the niceness was just a perverse form of racism

503
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
Well I would say racism plays an enormous role in why Japanese citizens were interned in the first place I don't think there's any question about

504
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
That's Paul Springer he's a military historian Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama

505
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
All of this

506
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,288
He doesn't know what you got to be careful because you're comparing

507
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Treatment of citizens

508
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
The treatment of prisoners of War

509
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
And that's different that's not a fair comparison

510
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,504
For the case of of why you treat the German pows better

511
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Well because the prisoners of War

512
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,136
Japanese pows were also exceedingly well treated

513
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,512
They were treated much better than the Japanese citizens of the United States and I think that's the comparison

514
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
That's probably more interesting is why did you treat

515
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Enemy soldiers from Japan

516
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Better than you treated

517
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
Citizens of the United States of Japan

518
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Heritage

519
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,592
And he says very simply that with prisoners of War

520
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
It's because we had a rule governing international law

521
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Like the Geneva Convention

522
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
There's no similar law

523
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,368
At that time that says what you can and can't do towards your civilian population

524
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,464
It's like maybe we're not racist or Noble

525
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
But both

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,096
And it's the rules that allow us to be our better selves

527
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
I think that in a time of War it's incredibly difficult to be good to your enemy it's not Justa

528
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,872
About aspiring to be good this American ideal it's about having

529
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
97

530
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,528
Really nitpicky tiny tedious rules to tell you exactly what you can do

531
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
And what you can't do

532
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Because it would just be

533
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
So easy to not be the person that you

534
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Want to be

535
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
In that moment

536
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
Just going to make you think back to February of 2002

537
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Good afternoon

538
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
I have an announcement to make

539
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
President Bush today has decided that

540
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
At the Geneva Convention

541
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Will apply to the

542
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
The Taliban detainees

543
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
But not

544
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
The Arcada International terrorist

545
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
The president has maintained the United States commitment to the

546
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
The principles of the

547
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Geneva Convention

548
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
I'll recognize him

549
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Vention Sibley does not cover

550
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
Every situation in which people may be captured

551
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Detained by military forces

552
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
As we see in Afghanistan today

553
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,448
Prisoners

554
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
Will not get any more protection than they already

555
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,360
Are given under the Geneva Convention what you seem to be telling us is that the

556
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Detainees will get fewer

557
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,712
Nope there's no change in the protections they will be

558
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Provided

559
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
There

560
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
They've always been treated consistent with the principles

561
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Geneva Convention

562
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Which means I'll be treated well

563
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
If you're looking for anything that will not happen.

564
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
As a result of this announcement is that they will not receive stipend

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
American taxpayer

566
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
They will not receive musical instrument

567
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Courtesy of the United States military

568
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,936
They would have received those had they been declared pows

569
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
They will continue to be treated well

570
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
Because they're in the custody of America

571
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,664
That's the concern the debate here was about if you don't do it here

572
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
The US soldiers

573
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
To be mistreated abroad is not correct and so is not a big

574
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
A big motivation here

575
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,416
Did the u.s. soldiers get the same kind of treatment is important for all nations

576
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Route the world

577
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Treat any prisoners

578
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Well

579
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
And that is something nice as always expect

580
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,888
And United States always.

583
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,264
David will get one more

584
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
And then look around

585
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
Wasn't this an important concern

586
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
It was important for this Administration

587
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,272
To be able to say look we want to protect our soldiers

588
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Equations

589
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Down the line

590
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
And if we if we don't Accord

591
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
If you don't work.

592
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,464
Phillies out of the Geneva Convention in Arkansas to be in peril

593
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
I was not in the NFC deliberations were various

594
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,120
Issues were raised inside really just no way I can actually answer that question

595
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Horses they don't they often do not wear uniforms they often do not carry their weapons out really if they're captured

596
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,944
If they wouldn't be convention apply to all and those turn speaker themselves

597
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Okay thank you

598
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
