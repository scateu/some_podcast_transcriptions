Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and today we are we're celebrating

00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
A multiple set of anniversaries because it was 80 years ago 80 years ago that Orson Welles

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,480
And the Mercury Theater

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,600
Decided to allow martians to invade the state of New Jersey

12
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
One of the most famous

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,720
Broadcast in broadcast history because it freaks

14
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
People out

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Yes

16
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,352
Nearly 10 years ago we decided to take

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,496
Another look at this broadcast which has gotten very complicated and Laird

18
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,640
And disputed in some ways overtime we are now celebrating our 10th they're celebrating their 80th so

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Along with Orson Welles when I couldn't be here tonight

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
We would like to present

21
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Our homage

22
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
2

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
I guess two microbes

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
He hasn't had to do the little earthlings that save the planet right so in honor of the microbes and honour of war the

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
The world which broadcasts 80 years ago today

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
Tonight here is our take

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
On War of the World

28
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
October 30th

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
1930

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
I'm at 9th United States

31
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Experience the kind of math

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Stereo

33
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Do we never see me fall

34
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
And the reason

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
What's today's sounds almost comical

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
Was a radio play

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,376
Affiliated stations with Orson Welles and the mercury theatre on the air

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
In the War of the Worlds

39
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848
Around 12 million people were listening most got the joke

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
It was Halloween after

41
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
But if you consider that about one out of every 12

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
People didn't get

43
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
The job that's what surveys found after

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
That one

45
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Every 12 people who

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
You heard the broadcast thought it was true

47
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
And it's some percentage

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,744
That 1 million people ran out of their homes

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
Towels over their faces clutching children tripping breaking limbs

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Well that

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Constitutes a major freakout

52
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Inducer

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,616
First ever live our on Radiolab. St. Paul Minnesota at the Fitzgerald theater we asked

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Why

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Why do people panic

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
And of course we'll ask the big questions what which is

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Can it happen again

58
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:11,232
I'm Jared I'm rotten thank you all for coming and where is my

59
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
College

60
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
So let me let me just say if you had said I'm just a tiny bit puzzled

61
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Which is my name

62
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
And I

63
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
With all due respect I mean if we had

64
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Any number things

65
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
We could have done in the hour

66
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Sex lives of watermelon

67
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Chrysanthemum

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,136
Why choose a martian Invasion radio show

69
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
From 1938 old old

70
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Valquest USA

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Truth is I accidentally discovered the world

72
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Recently

73
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
In 2001

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Maxine not long after that day in

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
2001

76
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
It just

77
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Really struck me

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
It wasn't

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
So much that the broadcast had a kind of end of the world Miss

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
I guess we're all feeling in real life that moment

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
It was more just the way that the

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Story

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Unfolded

84
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
And how in the broadcast you felt like you were

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Lost inside a news

86
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Which is not unlike what it was like Concerta

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
What was going on

88
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
And that's that was very much

89
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
I think what they were trying to create in the broadcast but

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Now many years later

91
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
What I'm really left with Issaquah

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Well if I were alive

93
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
1930

94
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Turn up the radio

95
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
I heard this sound

96
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
What would I say

97
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
What I believed it

98
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
What about you

99
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
I don't know I don't know

100
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
Okay well let's do something

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Sexy go back tonight.

102
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
38

103
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,679
And see if we can figure out how these sounds landed on people's ears and what information they have in their heads

104
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Say I need your help with this

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
I would like help with

106
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
I want to go over to that seat right there that's we're going to call that seat 1938

107
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
All right there

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Okay

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Hey now just let's just all a match

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
There you are and your easy

111
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Charrier

112
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Maybe drink

113
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Cream soda

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Tune the dial

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
I've got something on the dial

116
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,823
From the Meridian room in the Park Plaza Hotel in New York City we bring you the music of Raymond Raquel

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Who is Rick

118
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Raymond's Run

119
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,503
Spanish

120
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
You don't know that there's no such

121
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Person is Ramon Rec

122
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Hello

123
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,791
Set the record in a CBS Studio but it sounds professional enough so you sit back you relax

124
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
But then

125
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,447
Ladies and gentlemen we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental radio news

126
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
A 20 minutes before 8 central time

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,383
Recessive Jennings Observatory reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars

129
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen

130
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
I'm moving toward the Earth

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Playing for you in the Meridian Hotel

132
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
New York

133
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
So at this point you think

134
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
I'm thinking explosions on Mars hydrogen gas moving towards our it's a little strange but how could it be so bad if

135
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
If I still get to listen to The Fabulous notes of the lovely Raymond

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,271
Continue to play for another minute 34 seconds

137
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
It happens again

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
Why does he travel in following on the News Bulletin the moment ago

139
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
Getting further let me ask of really basic Quest

140
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Dealing with Apple

141
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Radio play

142
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
Why would Orson Welles and his

143
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Passive

144
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Starter play this way

145
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
The original it

146
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
HG Wells story

147
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,455
Was written in 1898 so was really old book

148
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,039
Time and there is no reporter character in the book by the way

149
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
Does anybody know this War of the Worlds story are most people do

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
The store base was this little green creatures from Mars for a number of reasons have to do with thirst

151
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,303
Is there something have to leave their planet and they come to Earth they're not very nice

152
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
People

153
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
They invade they destroy quite a number of us

154
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
And then Ironically in the end

155
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
They get killed by little viruses are smallest inhabitants are planted

156
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Bite them and Destroy them

157
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
It's science fiction of course but in 1938

158
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
Most kids knew this story was a very popular

159
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,551
So I don't see why

160
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Orson Welles producer the time John Houseman

161
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Austin and I chose it

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
We decided time to come we should be doing up

163
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
Science fiction show I'm so we

164
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
Try to fuse it run very easy to do in just a few days before they have to be on the air with their next installment John Houseman

165
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
That book off the shelf

166
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Shows at owa says hey what about this

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Orson Welles

168
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Says this

169
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
You want me to do this

170
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,247
But he had trouble in what sense in the sentence

171
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
If it was something that happened 50 years ago everybody knows it didn't happen

172
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
So who the hell cares

173
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,071
How to make people care about the old story we've got updated

174
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
1998 1930

175
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
And it just so happened

176
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
One month prior something had happened that forever changed the world and the news

177
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
You always at

178
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,455
Will begin with this man

179
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Hitler was threatening Europe first Austria then Czechoslovakia World War II

180
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
Turn on the corner in CVS send a team of guys to cover the story among them Edward R Murrow

181
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
European country

182
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,751
And in September Morrow and his CBS producer did something with the news that

183
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
What kind of novel

184
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
They broke

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,967
In this program of music

186
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
Never happened before

187
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
But never quite like this

188
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Life report

189
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:33,951
Discount and never quite so much

190
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
I'm just one month these buttons become so numerous program to bring you a special broadcast that bulletins were practically

191
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
Interrupting bring you a special broadcast

192
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
These constant interruptions it's easy to understand why this play

193
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Didn't sound like a play

194
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Astronomical watch on any further disturbances

195
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Occurring on the planet Mars

196
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:16,447
We have arranged an interview with another the astronomy Professor Pearson.

197
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,287
In a few moments we will take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton New Jersey

198
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
We were 71 pill then the music

199
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
Isn't it interesting how slowly it start

200
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
What time do you got on your

201
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207

00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Watch there

203
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Add a pocket watch says

205
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
04

206
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
804

207
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Tell me

208
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
When it gets the 805

209
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Fatal Five

210
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Pans

211
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Now this is

212
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
My favorite minute

213
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
In

214
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Understanding one of the greatest media hoaxes

215
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
What times do the thing that's interesting

216
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
Is it at this moment in

217
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
October of 1938 Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater of the air

218
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
We're not that Poppy

219
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
They had a tie

220
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Tiny

221
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Tiny slice

222
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Of the Aria

223
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
It's a not too many people were listening certainly not at the beginning from 8

224
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
Forced into not too many people heard

225
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
This

226
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Very

227
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Columbia Broadcasting

228
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Was that the War of the Worlds

229
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
By HG Wells

230
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
But why why didn't I hear that

231
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Well good at that very same moment

232
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
The majority people listening word tune into this

233
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,279
The Chase and Sanborn hour

234
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
It had the puppet Charlie McCarthy

235
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Opposite Mercury Theater Viera

236
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
10 * 8

237
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
At 8:05

238
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Host Don Ameche introduces

239
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Not so popular singer

240
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
And just at that moment

241
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
1200 we don't know how many listeners started to dial sir

242
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
Where they landed on the Mercury Theater they are already in progress

243
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,151
Where they stay but we already know

244
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Because by then

245
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
A strange

246
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Meteor hits

247
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
Where Carl Phillips are commentator will interview Professor Richard Pearson famous astronomer

248
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
May I begin

249
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
And anytime is closed

250
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
That living intelligence as we know it does not exist on Mars

251
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Better chance

252
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Is against it a thousand to one

253
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
And yes

254
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
How do you account for these gas eruptions occurring on the surface

255
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
The planet

256
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
Canada consulate

257
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Kneaders on

258
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Meteors on Mars March

259
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Meteors

260
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,255
What meteors on Mars and just as you are utterly confused Along Comes The X

261
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
People surveyed afterwards

262
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
I didn't

263
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
Believe this thing I thought it was all bologna until I heard that government official guy or the Princeton professor

264
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
And this script

265
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Chock-full

266
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Unbelievable

267
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
Natural History Museum

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,783
Enrichment Captain Lansing of the signal card

269
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
To convince people that something was in fact happening

270
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
A Feeling

271
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
Furthered a moment later when the professor

272
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
The reporter Carl Phillips Goliath

273
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
To that field

274
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
In Grovers Mill New Jersey

275
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Meteorite

276
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Whatever it is

277
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Atlanta

278
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Metal casing

00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Not found on this Earth

281
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,823
The Earth's atmosphere usually test holes in a meteorite this singing

282
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
The end of the thing is beginning to flake off

283
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Papa

284
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Calling someone

285
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Something like

286
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Black holes luminous desk

287
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
The eyes are like their face might be on the timer

288
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
Something out of the Shadow like a gray snake

289
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,327
That's going to be shape with saliva I hate you

290
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655

This is tape of the Hindenburg crash

295
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Still fresh in people's minds happened one year before the black

296
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Before going on the air that night

297
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Actor Frank Reddick who played

Went to the library Doug up

300
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
This old

Nestle in New Jersey

311
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Those pictures know what that means

312
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
What anything means

313
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
I got a small beam of light against the mirror

314
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Transmission cuts off

315
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
12 million people

316
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Have just heard

317
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
Slithery green aliens eviscerate

318
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Policeman

319
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Farmers

320
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
And reporters

321
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Followed by

322
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Nothing

323
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,623
Ladies and gentlemen go to circumstances beyond our control we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grovers Mill

324
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
Evidently there's some difficulty with our field transmission

325
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
However

326
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
We will return to that point of the earliest opportunity is it that grounded Flying Saucer that is that

327
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Well this man has now stood up

328
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,799
It's as tall as a tree and it is marching

329
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Through the countryside

330
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
Dumping everything in its path and then we are taking two

331
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
Field Report live battle scenes between militia and pause before we do

332
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Let me play

333
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
One more

334
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
But this one is real

335
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
I wish to have been evacuated

336
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
You should send him to school

337
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Tomorrow Friday

338
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
With hand luggage

339
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
Containing the child gas mask

340
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
A change of underclothing

341
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
This is Edward R Murrow reporting from London same time.

342
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
Just to give you a sense of how scary it was to be alive

343
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
At this moment

344
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Kids in England were being told to take

345
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Gas masks

346
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
To school

347
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,551
All of which would have made the following dramatize battle scenes

348
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
You take you now to the field headquarters of the state militia

349
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
Grovers Mill New Jersey

350
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
All the more real

351
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
37 degrees

352
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,215
Hear the New Jersey militia

353
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Fire on a

354
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Fleet of Martian pods

355
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
24 meters

356
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
Theirselves bounce right off

357
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
In the Martians in retaliation release date

358
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
Cloud poisonous gas

359
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Slowly overtaking soldiers

360
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
Ladies and gentlemen I have a grave announcement tonight

361
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,007
Incredible as it may seem both the observations of Science and the evidence of our eyes

362
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,639
Lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmlands tonight

363
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,967
Are the Vanguard of an invading Army from the planet Mars

364
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
The battle which took place tonight

365
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,927
A group of males has ended one of the most OP into feet ever suffered by an Army in Mountain Time

366
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
7900 rifles and machine guns

367
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Hit against

368
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
The single fighting machine of the Invaders from Mars

369
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
129 survivors

370
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Virginia

371
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,127
How much does now in control of the middle section of New Jersey

372
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Effectively cut the states

373
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,551
Highways to the north south and west of clogged with frantic human-friendly tsunami reserves are unable to control the Matt's lights

374
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,623
Communication lines are down from Pennsylvania to divide

375
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
What's the time in service discontinued. New Jersey in Easton Pennsylvania

376
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Increasing speed North Andover houses

377
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
This time we take you to watch the Secretary of the Interior

378
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
Feel the gravity of the situation

379
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Oxygen cylinders

380
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Calling all over the country this is the end now no more defensive

381
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
Everything wiped out

382
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,335
Exactly how many people panic

383
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
What we do now

384
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Trenton

385
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Police Department

386
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Got 2000 calls in under 2 hours

387
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
The New York Times switchboard received 875 calls alone

388
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
From people

389
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Wanting to know where they be safer

390
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
On the roof

391
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Or in the gas raid shelter

392
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
The cellar

393
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
We're lucky we do have

394
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
Transcripts what happened on the other side of radios that night thanks to

395
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
The Princeton sociologist

396
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
Who went out and conducted a series of interviews after the broadcast

397
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,663
And what's amazing is how effective that broadcast was some Lister said

398
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
We actually felt

399
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
Like they were choking

400
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,391
Others reported to police that they saw with their own eyes as they go to the Manhattan skyline they saw

401
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
Hudsonville smoke from the battle over the city

402
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,608
Some said they sought Martian machines high-stepping their way down the Palisades splash splash splash

403
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:31,008
And many people when they called operators are police they didn't say oh my God we're being invaded by Martians

404
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
They said oh my God we're being invaded by

405
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
German

406
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
Here are some of the literal transcript of this is what real people

407
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Actually said

408
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Is everybody ready

409
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
I knew it was some German

410
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Trying to gas us all

411
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
But when the announcer kept on calling them people from Mars

412
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
I just thought he was ignorant

413
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
I immediately called up the Maplewood police and asked if there was anything wrong

414
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Dancer

415
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
We know as much as you do

416
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
Keep your radio TuneIn

417
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
I called in to my husband

418
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Dan

419
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
Why don't you get dressed

420
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
You don't want to die in your working clothes

421
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
I looked in

422
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,688
Xbox on saw some chicken left from Sunday dinner that I was saving for Monday night.

423
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Set to my nephew

424
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
We may as well eat this chicken

425
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
We won't be here in the morning

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
This is Orson Welles ladies and gentlemen

427
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Out of character

428
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,400
To show you that the War of the Worlds has no further significant

429
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
But at the Holiday offering it was intended

430
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Is the B

431
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,848
We annihilated the world before your very is and utterly destroy the CBS

432
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,176
You will be relieved I hope to learn that we didn't

433
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Minutes

434
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
And the bothans

435
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
Institutions are still open for business

436
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
That was how Orson Welles concluded the War of the Worlds broadcast with those words

437
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Basically

438
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
The joke

439
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Gotcha

440
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
But it was only after he and his producer John has been left

441
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Austin read the papers the next day

442
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
They understood just how much trouble.

443
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
Sweaters very disagreeable because

444
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Of

445
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
For at least

446
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
A couple of hours

447
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
We believe We Will mass murder

448
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Surprised to learn that

449
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
Victoria has become familiar to children

450
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
The meaning of comic strips

451
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
And

452
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
This is wells in the press conference that following day

453
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Mini

454
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Speeding

455
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Novels an adventure story

456
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,376
Had such a profound effect upon radio listener

457
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
So immediately so profound that the FCC commissioner of the time

458
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
George Henry Payne

459
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Labeled

460
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
The Mercury Theater the air get the

461
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Terrorists

462
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Radio terrorist

463
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
But there is one thing we must not overlook

464
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
All this took place in 1938

465
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
NLS sophisticated yes

466
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
I did not know the atom bomb guided missiles

467
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
A rocket ship made shortly fly to the moon

468
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
Eva demuro 1957 with correct

469
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,728
Really so unsophisticated in 1938

470
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
I mean so different from now

471
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Wow

472
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Let's see

473
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,968
We interrupt this broadcast for some breaking news this just in

474
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
It seems we may have gotten

475
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Few

476
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
Things wrong when we perform that show many years ago most notably just now when I said that the FCC

477
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,232
Ochsner in 1938 called Orson Welles

478
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
The radio terrorist

479
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
In his statement

480
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
He certainly suggests that but if you read it it seems he was actually referring to a statement he made about a year earlier where he was

481
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Who's calling

482
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Radio producers

483
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Who terrorized

484
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,384
Children he doesn't actually named Orson Welles by name

485
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Just bought that

486
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,808
My apologies and we have this guy to thank for bringing it to our attention Michael sokolow and Associates

487
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Professor

488
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,160
Journalism and communication at the University of Maine

489
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
Mike sokolow also makes an interesting argument at the panic

490
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
May not have been

491
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Is largest we made it sound

492
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
For example

493
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,680
We stayed the 12 million people were listening on that night which is a widely

494
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
The quoted number

495
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
It comes from polling

496
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
6 weeks after the war of the worlds first aired

497
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
Stoklosa specs

498
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,432
The actual number of listeners is way smaller that's no way to know for sure

499
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Petrus

500
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Poll conducted

501
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
That night

502
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,856
That night when the broadcast was on 5,000 Americans were survey

503
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
By the c e Hooper comp

504
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
The reading Survey Company

505
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Why are we bothering with

506
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,840
Study done six weeks later after the newspaper tells everybody that there was this giant panic

507
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
Why don't we look at the surveys that were done that night

508
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
And the survey that was done 12 hours later by CVS the following morning what are the two surveys immediately after say

509
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
The CEO of uber rating survey

510
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Thumb 98% of the respondent

511
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
We're not listening to Orson Welles War of the Worlds they were listen to the Chase and Sanborn hour or the radios were off or they were listening to in

512
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Another program

513
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
Of the 2% that they found

514
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,392
That we're listening to War of the Worlds

515
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,720
Not a single respondent thought it was a news broadcast

516
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Sokolov strongly suspected

517
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Panic was actually trumped-up by the newspapers

518
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
Who were trying to sort a piss on this new medium called radio

519
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
It was taken away there you know

520
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Audience exactly

521
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Here was the opportunity

522
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Radio

523
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,456
The radio industry in the newspaper industry have been battling for years and throughout that decade

524
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
The entire newspaper industry had been losing

525
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
Money political Prestige and other things to the radio in the

526
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
You know some of their best employees

527
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
And so they were waiting for a way to really

528
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Prove Advertiser

529
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Improve the federal regulators

530
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
They had the first amendment

531
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,376
They understood responsibilities of the newspaper manager

532
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
These radio guys were conflating advertising with programming they were frightening their viewers they were acting irresponsibly

533
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,384
And remember this is a month after Munich when radio proved that news really works

534
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
On the radio

535
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,248
Well one month after radio news Pino comes of age

536
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
Suddenly there conflating news accounts

537
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
With fiction

538
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
And they're acting irresponsibly new terrorizing the public

539
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,488
And to the newspaper industry had the perfect thing to hang their critique of radio on

540
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
To all those

541
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
All those

542
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Eyewitness accounts that

543
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,960
The panic and I thought it was this and I packed my bags and whatever whatever and all the sort of

544
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Reports

545
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
People miscarrying do you feel like that's all

546
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,432
Memory embellished or what how do you clean up that I may give you let me give you an analogy okay

547
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
If you were asked 100 Americans today

548
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,320
Did you see a plane fly into the World Trade Center outside

549
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
September 11th

550
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
I think you would get an extremely high percentage

551
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
People saying they saw that plane fly

552
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,536
But that's because it's part of our national visual memory

553
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,680
It's really a trauma and it's it's it's the kind of Hysteria Panic or talk about that moment in time and our relationship to the media

554
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
Okay

555
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,336
But if you were to actually find out whose TVs were on live at 9:48 in the morning that day

556
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
And who was actually watching

557
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
It would be a discrepancy in that number

558
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
Now am I saying all those people are lying

559
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
All those people are

560
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Confused

561
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Know what I'm saying is that the relationship

562
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,672
Of memory to the media is extremely calm

563
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,768
Complex indeed and we think Michael sokoloff for checking her facts

564
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
And if you believe as he does the 1938 Panic was

565
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
What didn't happen it wasn't as bad as

566
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,728
Is it sounds that actually makes what we talked about next in our life Broad

567
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Even more puzzle

568
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
We'll be right back with radio labs live

569
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920

585
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

586
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

587
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,368
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

588
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

589
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,352
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

590
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

591
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

592
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

593
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,368
If you have a story please share it with us

1938

600
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,048
I'm going to ask the house for a show of hands do you think that

601
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,912
Somebody else could imagine the broadcast using the exact same script more or less

602
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,264
Also with martians also invading also interrupting the musical things

603
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Same to you

604
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
After all the publicity for the 1938 broadcast

605
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
Could you do it

606
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Twice show of hands

607
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Please

608
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,504
Some of you don't think so

609
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,880
There wasn't another one of these what would we be doing for the

610
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,768
Those of you who raise your hand

611
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
You are correct

612
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584

613
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Again and I want to tell you story it and amazing

614
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Another reported

615
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Story of a War of the Worlds

616
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Reenactment happened

617
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
In the mountains of

618
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
Quito Ecuador 1949

619
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:47,968
We were very lucky we had a reporter Tony Fields who have to be traveling there we have to do a couple of interviews

620
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
And he brought back some taping

621
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Play it for me

622
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
Alright so tell me set the scene for me 1949

623
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
Where is Quito Quito is the capital of Ecuador

624
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Go to Iquitos

625
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
In the middle of the mountains in the Andes Mountains

626
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
And Motown Big Town

627
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Keto now is a big city

628
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
At the time it was a pretty small City

629
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
The word that everybody who I spoke to use to describe the way the Kita wasn't 1949 with tranquilo

630
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,688
Exactly it is what it sounds like AM radio Quito

631
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
Was the most popular radio station

632
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Everybody listen to it

633
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Does your basic ingredients

634
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,696
You got a small town population 200

635
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
1000 station

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
Which also happened to be in the same building as

637
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,960
The one major newspaper El Comercio and the leader of the radio station

638
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Kia devious

639
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
Fellow by the name of Leonardo

640
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,200
One day someone shows up with a script for Orson Welles not HD Wells Orson Welles version

641
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Leonardo Pia series it says

642
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
We got to do this hearing

643
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:04,256
They insert local place named Jocelyn set of the Martians Landing in New Jersey they would land in Coca-Cola which is on the outs

644
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Taquito

645
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,888
They write in parts for government officials and minister of the Interior the mayor of

646
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
Keto

647
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Pictures of real death would be back

648
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Doing impressions during impression

649
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Not only that

650
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Highest goddess boss

651
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,152
At the newspaper El Comercio

652
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:26,016
To agree to run little articles in the newspaper in the two days leading up to the broadcast

653
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Reporting that

654
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Strange objects

655
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
Have been seen in the Skies over

656
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Marketo

657
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Wow

658
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
So he set out to screw with people

659
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
He was

660
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Planting paranoia

661
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
It really seems like he wanted people

662
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
I believe

663
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
What they were hearing that

664
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,384
Okay so Saturday February 12th 1949

665
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
The day of the Bride

666
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
All day long

667
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Listeners hear an announcement

668
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
It is going to be a special performance

669
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Like a Duo benitez valencia

670
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,488
Benitez Valencia

671
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304
Where are one of the most popular musical acts in town

672
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:18,496
Are cockroaches around Benitez Valencia

673
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
Launches into their performance

674
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
They play a few song

675
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
And suddenly

676
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
There's any corruption

677
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
What was that

678
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
Well it turns out that Leonardo pies in addition to the other trick he had up his sleeve

679
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,184
He had a sound effects guy in the corner

680
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Creating

681
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,632
The sound like when a Garrison keillor's guys kind of thing

682
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,872
The Music Stops and Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says

683
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
These dear listeners excuse

684
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:05,600
The technical difficulties there seems to be some sort of atmospheric conditions interfering

685
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,928
With the radio keep the signal but you are listening to radio keep.

686
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,000
Brought to you by you know such and such and

687
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
Now back to Benny despondency

688
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
So we hear another couple

689
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
Who songs and then there's another interruption

690
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
If Leonardo tires again this time

691
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
This time is the news flash

692
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736
So now run script has out to

693
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,040
Report from the scene

694
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,856
Empire is doing the play-by-play you know what is this

695
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,720
Waiting on my God the cops on scooters in your combat tentacles

696
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,608
And here come the heat red

697
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
And that

698
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Tires in scribe

699
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
You can wait wait wait wait do we have

700
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Forget reenactments do we have

701
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,944
A copy of that the real broadcast from that night all we have our description

702
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
There is no existing recording

703
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
What was broadcast

704
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
That night and and you'll understand why in a second

705
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,952
By all accounts

706
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
It worked

707
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Outsiders Shear May everything that happened next happened

708
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Extremely quickly

709
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Poured out into the streets

710
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
People were running

711
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,592
But they didn't know where to run

712
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
The spaceship supposedly was in the north of the city but this black cloud of gas was in the South and

713
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,832
Klonopin actually did what any good Catholic would do

714
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Babe

715
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Made a beeline for the church

716
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:50,816
The church because because they were difficult would be safe there or Hap's or perhaps they just wanted to

717
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
Get right with God before the world ended

718
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
They're even reports and I wasn't able to confirm this but the reports of man confessing to adultery right there in front of their wives

719
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,824
Increase volume

720
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
Whole trout

721
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Google Google panni

722
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Annette Garcia

723
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Poquito

724
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,880
This is Jorge who is a longtime journalist with for many years at the newspaper

725
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Do the thing with his family

726
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,000
They all believed it they all ran outside found a taxi cab

727
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,864
Who the kids in russom ran behind the taxi cab

728
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,984
Gazelle

729
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Going the other way

730
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Convoy

731
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Military trucks

732
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Filled with soldiers

733
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,992
RealTracs real military band real military bands of the real soldiers

734
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,552
And cops behind them and they're screaming

735
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Towards the north of the city

736
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Where they going

737
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
They're going to cut the cord how to fight the Martian

738
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,024
Yeah so if you if you had any doubt it

739
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
Once you saw this military man Siri like

740
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Oblique

741
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,936
I've got to get the hell out right

742
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
Is everybody in keto believe didn't someone call the General beforehand say tonight we're having a boy

743
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,200
Dave the mayor or someone who sounded an awful like the mayor was on the radio saying martians renovate

744
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:17,856
The maiden call the General before I know now so so then what happens at the end of the show

745
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
They always do

746
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Then what

747
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Well they storm the radio station

748
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:35,520
By the time I broadcast ended and it was announced that the whole thing was a play huge crowd

749
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
What's Rena Street

750
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
And word that was a hoax

751
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Spread pretty quickly

752
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
All that fear

753
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,248
Turn pretty quickly to anger

754
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,344
By 9:30 is he's a few hundred people outside

755
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
The station

756
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,000
At some point the boxer shows out there just been a match in the Central Plaza in the box of shows up he's driving his truck

757
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,608
And the truck is full of rocks until of what rock is full of rocks

758
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
And people start

759
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Hurling The Rock

760
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
At the station at the windows

761
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,592
I'm Windows of shattering they managed to break into boat to the ground floor with a printing press

762
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
They're smashing printing presses

763
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:17,504
At some point some people in the crowd materialized and they have fees flaming torches

764
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:22,112
It just goes up like a match the clothes so so where people hurt during this

765
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
6 people died

766
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Really

767
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,256
Most escaped there's about fifty people in the building most

768
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Got to up to the roof

769
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Jump two adjoining buildings butts

770
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
People died

771
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
According to a reporter Tony

772
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
One guy

773
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
Stay behind

774
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
The last guy on the air that night was a man by the name of Louis

775
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Beltran

776
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
3 are you there yes I'm here

777
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
Okay this is Maria Beltran testagrossa

778
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
Louisville trans daughter

779
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Maria

780
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
You were listening to it to everything that just came

781
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Before this

782
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
Tell us the story from your dad's perspective from here

783
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
Forward that will he was he was on the air he was so I guess hosting the music program and also doing some of

784
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
The interruption with the with the bogus stuff

785
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
At the point at which the fire started what was he

786
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
Sing

787
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,944
When you realize the magnitude of the situation he went back on the air and began pleading for help

788
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,552
Pleading for assistance from the police and the fire department but

789
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
As you said before no help came because the police were going

790
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
The fight the Martian

791
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Yeah

792
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,024
And eventually he was the last one left

793
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
And

794
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
And he

795
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,168
Jumped out the window I've got from the either the 3rd or 4th floor onto a

796
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Second floor balcony

797
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,032
And to break the fall I guess

798
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,384
Instinctively want to break the fall he grabbed onto the railing of that balcony in

799
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,968
He was completely engulfed in flames at that point

800
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
And

801
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,088
Skin on his hands just remained on the balcony it was like a barbecue grill

802
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
And from there

803
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
He jumped

804
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,488
To the ground but before he jumped he

805
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,816
With pleading to the crowd to I guess catch him

806
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
But they didn't

807
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
He landed on cement

808
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Broke legs

809
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Arms

810
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
Ribs everything and

811
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,824
Compounded by the very very serious

812
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:23,200
Burned paddle over his body so he landed at the feet of an angry mob what

813
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
An angry mob and he

814
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
He recalled

815
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
That says he's losing Consciousness he just heard somebody say just just let him die in peace

816
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Although some of the articles that I read they try to

817
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Frozen back into the building

818
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
Really someone grabbed him and put him in a jeep

819
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
To take him to the hospital just a bystander

820
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,520
And he had so many scars here

821
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,080
As children like my brother and I would

822
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,479
We play with his scars you would Trace them with our finger and ask him what happened you know how we got the scars and he would tell us

823
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
About the fire

824
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
What would he tell you the whole

825
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,879
Storey or story he would just give us

826
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,231
And Justin broad term that he had been in a building that caught fire

827
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
Stop as children we didn't really ask him

828
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,119
Maybe had we been older and ask them he would have told us the whole story

829
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,191
We should say that your dad stayed behind

830
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
To try and help other people get out of the building

831
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
Let me ask you a question though

832
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
Eudoxie is a hero

833
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
But given the fact that he was one of the voices that

834
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Created

835
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
The panic

836
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
Did he feel some sort of ambivalence about

837
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:33,343
I don't know in retrospect whether he did or not I'm sure they must have been some ambivalence

838
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
But from what I understand a story was kept it was very top secret so that even the employees did not know

839
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
No

840
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
What was going to be broadcast during that music program

841
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:49,983
I don't know what what point he was informed of the details so I don't know really how we felt about I wish I had had

842
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
Opportunity to ask him

843
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
Who is Maria thank you so much for your time and joining us here

844
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Thanks

845
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,159
I just want to know what happened to the guy who planned the hose

846
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
Well he

847
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,303
He got out through the roof like a lot of others he hop to the next building

848
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Hit out for a few days

849
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
And then fled the country to Venezuela never to return

850
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,287
Never to return never to return but I should say that

851
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
Among the six people who died that night

852
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
What's his girlfriend

853
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
A nephew

854
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:38,623
Okay so the 1949 keto broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble the 1938 New York broadcast call

855
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:43,999
Was a whole lot of trouble not everybody here before who raised their hand and thought that this could happen again

856
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
You are right

857
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Again

858
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Thou

859
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Buffalo

860
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
19

861
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
68

862
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
Updated for the time it sounds kind of like your basic DJ set

863
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
Until you hear this

864
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Anime shop in here that I'm supposed to read thank you

865
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Li keqiang

866
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:08,063
Administration those people

867
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
I've alerted all their space watch and

868
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,279
Facilities to be on the alert for unusual communication difficulties tonight I supposed to be for the federal agency referred to the

869
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,119
Explosions on the planet Mars and said he was not knowing that they would have the same

870
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,471
Effect on Earth medication December explosions on the surface of the Sun

871
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,519
Sunspots and things like that so

872
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:33,919
I don't know what action other means it's going to be hard to hear Communications from NASA.

873
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
Are KB whatever Jamaica by communication

874
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
Structure as the original

875
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
Broadcast we heard tonight

876
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,375
Long stretches of music than the news bulletins in the semi realistic

877
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:59,775
Field reports use one of them

878
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,615
Pictures of martians

879
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,199
And according to the station manager JFK

880
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
You get the same outcome people

881
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,599
Bought it and Telephone Company reported to WKBW

882
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,159
But they received more than 4,000 phone calls

883
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
Canadian military authorities dispatched military units to the Peace Bridge the Rainbow Bridge and the Queenston Bridge to repellent

884
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,167
Story was tired the next day by 47 newspapers and Countrywide

885
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,471
And on the night of the shelling during the show

886
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,823
Can I press bureau's up and down the east coast of America where besieged by phone call

887
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
Asking about the Martian invasion in Buffalo

888
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Incredible

889
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
You're absolutely right it is incredible

890
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,743
Thanks to the folks at WKBW Buffalo for that what is this music

891
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
This is the Disco version of War of the Worlds 1978

892
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Obvious question to ask

893
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
What is the skip work

894
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
Well if that's a difficult question I came across a psychology

895
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
I'm Richard Gehrig Imo

896
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Professor of psychology in

897
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Experiment

898
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
Apple program

899
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
Here's this notion Richard

900
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
Does it rude people are suckers

901
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
The stories we just cannot help ourselves

902
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
When is Story start

903
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
You just kind of go

904
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
The norm is to fall in

905
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Story and that it

906
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
Unusual

907
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Keep yourself

908
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,567
My favorite example is there's a scene in Goldfinger

909
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Boom boom

910
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,199
Best James Bond

911
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Where bond is

912
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Tie downs

Laser cut

916
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Really looks like

917
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
And even if

918
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
Saying that right now I'm starting

919
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
A little bit of anxiety

920
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,327
Spoiler alert

Dustin Ackley

922
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,263
Go to watch the movie now and see if you can get through that

923
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,823
Suspense it really seems to say something

Is the sound of 700 people who have come to Bear Witness

939
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
Can I record a live show today we are at

940
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,839
The Fitzgerald theater in st. Paul Minnesota talking about the strange phenomenon that is the War of the Worlds

941
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,167
You know I ate is very greatest everybody's he request but this

942
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
There's one guy I really wish had been

943
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,567
Is that at the Ecuadorian die Leonardo what's the tightest yeah

944
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Because

945
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
He's the guy want to ask

946
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
What were you

947
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
That's what I want

948
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Well he's dead

949
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,831
He's bad news well but how old was she and what were you thinking

950
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Dead

951
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Daddy

952
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
So I found a guy who I think is definitely alive

953
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
I am Daniel Myrick

954
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,279
Co-writer co-director of the Blair Witch

955
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,143
Before making the Blair Witch Project and my record a recording

956
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
King of the world

957
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
He was a teenager

958
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
I just thought it was

959
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
Brilliant

960
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
Absolutely

961
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
The coolest

962
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Saying I'm with anything else he was impressed by the

963
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,455
The technique of the thing there's a couple moments in particular where they cut to the

964
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,343
On-site reporter cut in a second or two early

965
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
And you hear the report of saints are we on

966
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
And then he goes into his

967
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
In the character

968
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Here I am.

969
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
This is little pizzas little mama that really

970
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Guilty

971
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Excitement when I when I know how it affected

972
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,359
He was fascinated by the idea that scary stories get even scarier if you think they're true

973
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
So

974
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,455
Years later fresh out of film school he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez

975
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
Has decided to develop

976
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,343
Their own Wells like product your basic scary witch Story 3 kids go into the woods

977
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Okay we're leaving

978
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,927
Right now they got lost they bump into the witch

979
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,231
And then that they die or they think they die

980
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
Here's to never see them again

981
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:43,679
But when you entered the theater to see The Blair Witch Project the first thing that you see on the screen are these two sentence

982
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
In October of 1994

983
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,615
Three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville Maryland

984
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
While shooting a documentary

985
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
A year later their footage

986
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Was found

987
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
So the suggestion here

988
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
Is that what we see

989
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Might be

990
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:06,719
We are what we picked a subject matter that was difficult to disprove

991
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
To the casual

992
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Observer

993
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,559
Martians invading from outer space

994
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,143
Can you turn the channel to the next Network and if no one's reporting about it

995
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,959
Pretty well I sure it is probably fiction but

996
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:21,823
3 missing students in the woods you know that's something that is a little harder to disprove

997
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,359
Without a fair amount of scrutiny

998
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
And

999
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
It works

1000
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
We were getting

1001
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
Calls from

1002
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Police wondering where these

1003
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
3 kids word

1004
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,319
I never heard of this case you're killing oh yeah

1005
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,111
Constantly still getting emails

1006
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
What part of

1007
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Still any phenomena

1008
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
Burkittsville in

1009
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
All fix

1010
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
When is all made

1011
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
I think it reinforces what I thought

1012
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Ed and I suspected that

1013
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
So much of us

1014
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Wants to be

1015
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,031
Some people told Dan Myrick that after watching the three campers go in the woods

1016
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
They themselves would never go camping

1017
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
Again

1018
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
That was fabulous

1019
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,039
Why would you not want people to go camping

1020
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,903
Why would you do that to people

1021
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,255
I mean that's why you're doing it to me know you are not making this movie to kind of scare people

1022
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
We were making the film to

1023
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Really scared

1024
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,495
No regrets on people not wanting to go

1025
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,311
Camping afterwards

1026
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:31,199
So the question is is that what Orson Welles was up to back in 1938 was he just trying to get p

1027
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
People are good old-fashioned

1028
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:38,367
Show Business care make him scream way up in the balcony

1029
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
This was

1030
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Simply

1031
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
An entertainment this is Orson Welles ladies and gentlemen

1032
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
Office character

1033
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,607
To assure you that the War of the Worlds has no further significance

1034
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
When is the holiday offering everything 10

1035
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,823
The Mercury Theater Zone radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of abortion sing boo

1036
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,919
16 years later Orson Welles change

1037
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
The story

1038
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,759
Here is on the BBC the year is May 9th

1039
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,039
1055

1040
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
We weren't as innocent as

1041
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
We meant to be

1042
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,695
Why did the Martian broadcast we were fed up

1043
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
Was a way in which

1044
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,327
Everything that came over this new magic box

1045
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,863
The radio is being swallowed

1046
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
Turn away or broadcast

1047
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
Was there an assault on me

1048
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
Credibility

1049
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Day of that machine we want

1050
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
Do you understand

1051
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
But they shouldn't

1052
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Swallow

1053
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Everything that

1054
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Cancel the tap

1055
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
So here are two ways to think about

1056
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
The War of the Worlds 1

1057
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,391
It was a smashing entertainment using every trick they could think of including inventing some new ones

1058
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
To scare you silly Master storyteller

1059
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
Or

1060
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
4 +

1061
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
It was

1062
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,423
We're trying to send you a warning don't trust everything you hear on the radio it's not always true

1063
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Which one was it

1064
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
You think

1065
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
Well I asked

1066
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
Professor Jason lives with me

1067
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
Yeah you Jason pimp

1068
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,431
Hefei radio historian at the University of

1069
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,247
He says that what wells understood

1070
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
Was it a newscast

1071
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Is Austin two things at once

1072
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
The newscast

1073
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
You here

1074
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Something scary order

1075
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Disturbing sometimes

1076
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
But it's going to be told to you

1077
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,511
In a way that suzhou

1078
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,119
Meaning the authority The Voice the newscasters steady voice coming through the radio

1079
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
It will calm you

1080
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,679
Like President Roosevelt

1081
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
Famous Fireside

1082
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
My friend

1083
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
I want to talk for a few minutes

1084
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
The people of the United

1085
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,615
States about spanking

1086
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
When you study the rhetoric

1087
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Ted Roosevelt

1088
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
He really did convey to

1089
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
Messages 1

1090
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
We're in terrible Danger

1091
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
Into

1092
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
I've got a

1093
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
And that is the

1094
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
The sort of the the

1095
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
Authoritative voice

1096
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Coming out of

1097
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
The darkness

1098
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Visible

1099
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Disembodied

1100
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
The powerful man

1101
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
The news on September 22nd

1102
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
19

1103
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Octopus with marijuana

1104
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
Standing on a rooftop

1105
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
Flipping out over London

1106
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
Straight in front of a noun

1107
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
Yogurt to sounds in just a moment

1108
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
Keep giving us

1109
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,319
A story of an unfolding emergency

1110
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,391
I should think in a few minutes or maybe a bit of shrapnel around here

1111
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,207
But his Mastery of information

1112
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,511
His Mastery of his own voice

1113
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:30,911
His bravery on the scene

1114
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,471
This was the beginning of

1115
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
The format

1116
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
A fear

1117
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
Formatting

1118
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
And some people go

1119
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
To the news

1120
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
Not to be afraid but

1121
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
To be afraid and then to be

1122
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Reassured

1123
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Robert

1124
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
You file things for the news

1125
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
Do you buy this that a news

1126
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,135
Reporter

1127
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
Does these two things simultaneously

1128
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,255
Scares and then reassures and then scares

1129
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,791
Google cover the governor and say

1130
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
Let me know what I would do that why else would you talk

1131
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Me not you

1132
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,007
The Forum in Avenues is a

1133
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,103
Because the guy is always there because he's an anchor that's what the word means

1134
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
It is a reassuring thing to see them night after night

1135
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,479
Telling and telling Butler

1136
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,575
That the Real Genius of the War of the Worlds was that Wells put you

1137
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
Into news

1138
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,439
Will you expect anchors to Anchor and you expect reported to report

1139
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
I meant

1140
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
He kills the reporter and the anchor

1141
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:34,911
And suddenly your left all by yourself in your own living room all alone

1142
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
That is exactly right

1143
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:42,335
The moment of the War of the Worlds broadcast which still frankly terrifies me

1144
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
Is this moment right here

1145
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
It's like that silence is terrifying

1146
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
No anchor

1147
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
No reporter

1148
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,815
No-one to

1149
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
We assure you

1150
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Okay

1151
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
Forgetting up remember what about the second lesson that has a

1152
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
Something about don't believe the radio

1153
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
What about that

1154
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407
Did it work well professor says if that is really what wells was trying to do if you believe that will then he fell

1155
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
Failed actually worse than

1156
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
The War of the Worlds not months

1157
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,063
Not twice we push on you three broadcasting

1158
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,391
It was so good at grabbing an audience and sucking them in

1159
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:33,279
At the wills formula you might call it the newscast that scares you enough to keep you listening has been adopt

1160
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
To buy a Volvo

1161
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
News companies

1162
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:41,471
Right now at 11 at night of shopping turns into a night of fear

1163
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
Muslim immigrants

1164
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
It's a deadly mix

1165
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,687
Terror in the toilet and sinkholes and landslides

1166
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,991
Lights on in the car.

1167
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,063
Baby go terrorist working at one of our airports

1168
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Terror in the toilet

1169
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
Pythons in the potty

1170
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:05,279
Maybe there was a snake somewhere near a toiletry facility of some kind but it's

1171
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Probably wasn't the python

1172
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,959
It probably wasn't your toilet but you don't know that you want to hear that belongs to mrs. James C McGill

1173
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,799
2214 Bode Boulevard and not you so

1174
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:21,407
You you want to be reassured and so you listened and so you fall in

1175
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,015
Any Orson Welles retelling a martian Invasion Story by HD

1176
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
And most people already knew

1177
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
If he could grab

1178
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
And if I could do it again in Ecuador

1179
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,255
And then if they can do it again in Buffalo

1180
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,559
What is that tell you it tells you

1181
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
And we can't help ourselves

1182
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,167
Even if the headline is slightly proposed

1183
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
Even if it's slightly scary

1184
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,519
Even if it's slightly

1185
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,055
False

1186
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,103
We will listen

1187
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,991
The fear of that these broadcast generate now

1188
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:03,647
You suck I said and you think that 70 years later we be more sophisticated and critical when did local newscaster tell

1189
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,511
Tells us that there's something we're feeding our children that could kill them and they'll tell us after the news

1190
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,631
I still listen I'm a media critic and I still wait through the commercials to see

1191
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:18,495
What is it that I'm doing the can my child even if it's really employed what your shoelaces will kill you

1192
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,263
