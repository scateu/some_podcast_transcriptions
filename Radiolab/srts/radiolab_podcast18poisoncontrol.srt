Literally talking to another world

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:40,448

Panic attack

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Well I guess we should

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Start by

20
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
Let's just try to recall like what it was

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,208
I don't even know how you bumped in like you don't normally okay so back in

22
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,488
2015

23
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
My husband Nick and I

24
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
In our tiny apartment

25
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
Back in Brooklyn and we were new parents are

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Son Marty was 18 months old at the time

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
And

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
One morning I think it was about 5 a.m.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Like still dark Marty woke up and he was just

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
Crying crying crying and so

31
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,712
Tapped my husband it was his turn to get up early and go get Marty

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
So he got out of bed

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
I fell right back to

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
To sleep and the next thing I knew

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
I would like

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Felt somebody tapping me and I sort of rolled over in my bed and there was just this little person looking up at me

37
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Covered it this

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
Greasy stuff all over his face with shiny

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
And he was laughing and he held up in his hand

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Giants

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Jar of

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Diaper

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Appointment

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,128
The special medicated stuff that we had bought just that last week and I just

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Oh my God

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
He just ate all this medicine and I have no idea how much he ate and then I look around in my husband

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
We got enough of them changed his diaper and they put him down in the Florida Play had because he was exhausted falling asleep in the chair

48
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
While watching him

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
So I just

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
Flung myself to the end of the bed and I grabbed Marty in one arm and started

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,936
Frantically searching the label which was filled with words like

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Petrolatum

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Saracen

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Panthenol glycerin

55
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Isabel law

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Brenda said she didn't register any of those

57
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
Because right underneath that list of ingredients I just saw this

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,272
Bold type that said if swallowed

59
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
Call your doctor Poison Control Center immediately

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,560
Touching my son and I'm clutching his jar and then I yelled my husband to wake him up and I'm like I need you to

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Find the number and call Poison Control while I hold Marty

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
And Sonic

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Snap into action leaps off the chair into the other room

64
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,104
So you make a call Brenna is left sitting there in the bed holding her 18-month old son

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Who is about to

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Throw up

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Pass out die

68
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
She's not sure like have you ever felt that Hollow feeling or like your whole chest

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Drops

70
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
And you just it's like it feels like missing a step here

71
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Just utterly sick

72
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
And then just like all

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Sweaty up in my temple

74
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
Sitting on the edge of our bed and my lap and I'm Eagle I watching for

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Like whatever's about Tuesday

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
And I had always heard that like

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,360
You have your mother's instinct or whatever that is in like moms know best and moms can tell when something's wrong with their kid and like

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
Sometimes maybe that's true but for me

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Rose

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
I was imagining like

81
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
This huge like

82
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Glop of ointment has worked its way down your esophagus and now it what is it doing to your stomach lining and what's going to happen when it like

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
I was just begun I can't take it back like what do I do

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
Nick has gone to the Next Room

85
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,704
And I hear that he's on the phone with someone and then just moments later

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Blackout

87
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
I said well

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
That was the most Pleasant phone call I've had in ages

89
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
There he was

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
Completely calm kind of like smiling at me and the doorway

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,024
And I'm just still hunched over the bed like hanging on the Marty thinking

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
What is going on

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
So Nick

94
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Straightened up

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
And then went into the lake okay

96
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Here's what happened I called

97
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
They immediately picked up

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,615
Brennan said that he told her you talk to this man the guy asked him super matter fact how much

99
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Marty Wade

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
I told him

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
20 lb

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Whatever yes then what brand of diaper ointment did Marty eat

103
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Then the guy did a little mental math and said

104
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Your child's going to be fun

105
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
Totally fine this will probably not a big deal at all was really common

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
No

107
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
Vomiting no no nothing

108
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,423
He was like just like a slippery little piglet at that point I cleaned him up and then let him play

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
But for the rest of the day I just kept thinking

110
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,175
What the hell is Poison Control I honestly didn't think we still live in a world where you can just call a hotline like

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,063
Get on the telephone and talk to a live Human who somehow knows everything about this one specific brand of diaper ointment

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
And then bam like 45 seconds later this full-blown crisis in my mind was just

113
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Thoughts

114
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
And then you know

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
I just was having this weird moment of like

116
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
There's this invisible network out there that was just

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Kind of primed and waiting

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
To help

119
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Are these people

120
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
So

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,687
A few months later I'm totally obsessed with poison control

122
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
I ended up in a skyscraper in downtown Chicago

123
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,159
19 floors gummies for twisty-turny quarter to the oldest Poison Control Center in America

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
We're here

125
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
When I got there and our staff wish there was something

126
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,863
Carol the senior director took me on a tour smaller than a

127
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
No it's not a dumb

128
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
But definitely is enough

129
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,311
I think I was expecting like the banks of the chi Tech

130
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
Lee Min computers and instead that phone has

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
So there it was

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Narrow

133
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Office with brick

134
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Carpet

135
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Crusty

136
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,903
Mushroom poster up there a cubicles I don't know whose Cubs hat that is but

137
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Like a basement

138
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,327
College computer lab you know like where all the machines are kind of still running Windows 95 or something like that

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
I'm sitting in front of those computers with poison specialist

140
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
I'm I'm I'm the snake by percentile of paneling

141
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
There's Aaron snakes like the little old lady who is like working her backyard there was a snake and she chopped off his head

142
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,759
Shuffle and then she brings a snake head into the ER to show them what bitter and there's Connie

143
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,855
How I look at it she take mushroom called even when she's on vacation is that true

144
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
Yes excited about it

145
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,023
Extend TV to work in the ER nurse by background is Jessica

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Make a phone call

147
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Tony

148
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
Hello honey bee expert

149
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
In everything

150
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,103
Illinois poison Center

151
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
And while I was there the stream calls was just nonstop.

152
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,319
As soon as one of them would hang up the phone another call would come in at 5

153
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Normally healthy

154
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Okay

155
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Gently wipe off

156
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Little warm

157
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Water on a washcloth

158
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Give him something to

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
To drink they told me that in order to work here

160
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
Eat a background of medicine special training

161
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Toxicology on top of that

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
Hope to have a good memory could math skills

163
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
But more importantly

164
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
What you really need

165
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Is to be able to stay

166
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
I usually tell people they're going to be overwhelmed by the

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
The first 3 months

168
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Glow stick

169
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
It's not going to be a problem are adorable

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
The other times a boy

171
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
They're like this

172
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
He has a temperature of 100

173
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
For this is an ER call a sugar again

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
The hospital was calling about a male patient

175
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Who been found unconscious

176
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Completely sweaty diaphoretic at home

177
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
So the Medics are assessing him his blood sugar was 40

178
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Tylenol

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
372

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Pupils she said her bouncing all over the place

181
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
I don't know what that mean

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,159
After she hung up ask Cindy if it was a self-harm call it's believed to be yes

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
She was saying that his wife just died of cancer

184
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Is it somewhat rare

185
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Not at all we get them all the time

186
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
At least

187
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Poison Center

188
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Can you spell that

189
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Can you spell the name of that

190
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
And how many milligrams

191
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Spending about 12 hours

192
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
There that day end if you send the Poison Control

193
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Spinner that long just

194
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Poison Center

195
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Alder watching over there he's coming and coming and coming you start to feel just kind of overwhelmed

196
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
Every single time the phone rings

197
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
There's somebody on the other side of the line in there in a moment of uncertainty

198
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Appendix

199
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Tylenol over

200
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
Prices this could be pretty serious and the scale of that

201
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
It's just kind of shocking we manage

202
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
80000 calls a year out of this room

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
And that's just this once

204
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Just Chicago

205
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
If you take the poison centers

206
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
All across the country they handle almost 3 million cases a year

207
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
So you get a call like mine

208
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Or much worse

209
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
About every 14-second

210
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
You know

211
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
Very poisonous plants

212
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
End

213
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
Thinking about just how many of us are bumping into these things that we think might be poisoning arsenic Mercury

214
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Are poisoning US Gold is poisonous to some extent silver not so poisonous pedal Turn You Blue I decided to call up

215
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Deborah Blum

216
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
Director of a knight science journalism program at MIT

217
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
And poison enthusiast

218
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
I love poisonous

219
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Even heard about called

220
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
The poisoner's handbook you're my husband worries about that a lot in fact he has not let me pour him a cup of coffee

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Coffee for the last

222
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
6 years since my

223
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,263
Are you serious right knee really was seriously he's always like

224
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
So

225
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,895
Never said that helps the kind of think of poison control as part of this much larger back and forth

226
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,247
What kind of a dance involving dance that we've been doing with our poisonous planet

227
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
Thousands of years we've been dancing with them

228
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
And different ways for a very long time if you go back and look

229
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
The hieroglyph

230
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Fixing Egypt

231
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
There is actually references to death by Peach

232
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
And that refers to cyanide poisoning because cyanides

233
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Are the primary poison in the pits of peaches FYI peaches actually written in a wall of a temple somewhere or

234
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Endeavor says

235
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
Go back to the beginning of that dance

236
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
You'll find that like with so many things it starts

237
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
With murder

238
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
Because we humans first got really interested in poisons

239
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
When you realize we could use them

240
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,975
Kill each other and one of my favorite examples is actually arsenic

241
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,863
Which in early nineteenth-century Europe was by all accounts the perfect, decided poisoned it was tasteless

242
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,727
It was odorless you could put it into vanilla pudding or oatmeal natural illness

243
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,079
Gioconda look like they had a bad gastroenteritis and at the

244
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,431
The time we had no way of detecting it literally only comments in the 19th century

245
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,783
Science has not figured out a way to detect a single poison in a quart

246
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Bowser what ruined this

247
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,183
Perfect well there was a chemist in Britain named James Marshall

248
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Worked out the sink

249
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Credibly

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
Tell me about the Sanders today primitive test

251
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
Which involve mincing up the tissue from the dead person and

252
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,007
Adding some acid and heating it up and Distilling it and then

253
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Is this Vapor comes out

254
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Cool

255
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Onto glass

256
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
And if there was any arsenic in the original

257
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
That are sick form

258
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Tiny dark

259
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Krystal's

260
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
And you got us there.

261
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Blackish

262
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Silver mirror

263
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Forming over the glass

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
And

265
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
That

266
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
Was actually the first

267
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Great test

268
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
A forensic toxicology the marsh test

269
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
This is sort of the moment Deborah says

270
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
The modern science joins our dance with poison

271
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Because if you see the rise of industrial chemistry and and our ability to synthesize Cyanide and

272
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Strychnine in some of these amazing life

273
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,551
Toxic elements you also see people's realization of how you

274
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Well they are

275
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Antlers

276
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
So cool around

277
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951

279
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Beginning of the 20th century

Headaches or whatever

285
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
And suddenly

286
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
All these poisons that you should just be out there in nature

287
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
We're in our homes or in the drugstore

288
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Alfred Apple

Used to digest tissue

305
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,111
Say there's like roadkill in a landfill put the roadkill in a sealed container with

Windex

319
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Just called ammonia

320
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
If you mix ammonia and bleach

321
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
What happens

322
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
A poisonous gas

323
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791

00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Also occurs naturally the atmospheres of Jupiter and

325
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
That's

326
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191

Open it and smell it

333
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,367
Okay well it says it can cause adrenal tumors in animals

334
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
It's carcinogenic in rodents

335
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
I hope I didn't smell too much of it

336
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Matt

337
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
You know what to get

338
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Chips

339
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
All right

340
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
We're very comfortable

341
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
With the fact that we walk down the grocery

342
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,103
Tri-Star tile are open up the medicine chest and we're surrounded by these different

343
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,711
You know in pill form or liquid form a spray form or whatever but these different compounds

344
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
That actually are dangerous reused

345
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
That we live

346
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Riot

347
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Which brings us to a guy

348
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Actually I saw this

349
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,327
Plaque dedicated to him on the wall at the poison Center in Chicago station

350
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Initiative and devoted service

351
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
Founder of the poison and drug information

352
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,567
I'm a guy named Lewis condolement Louis kedalaman who is they

353
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Brilliant scientist in this

354
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
State of Illinois

355
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,503
Lewis passed away back in 1995 but it's like Katherine and yes it's still very much alive

356
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,647
Absolutely he's 98 now but she met Lewis back when she was a 20 year old nurse working in St Luke's Hospital in Chicago

357
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
It was 1940

358
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
He was the pharmacy

359
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
In the hospital and everybody nulu

360
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
And we all love them and I was looking

361
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
I caught him

362
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Northland swordfish order man dark hair

363
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Big dark eyebrows

364
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Great personality and he would take care of everything that came along friendly but when it came to his work

365
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
To get very serious

366
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
The pharmacy was directly across

367
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Saul from the emergence

368
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
0

369
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
What's are happening is

370
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
You don't even notice this trend

371
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,511
I just about got this is the 1940s and doctors are totally winning against infectious diseases

372
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
And what that meant was that as far as the public was concerned

373
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
Keeping your family healthy and germ-free

374
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Is a big deal

375
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
And that meant keeping your home

376
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Super

377
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Complete duper

378
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,103
It really looks clean.

379
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
And at the same time there's just this explosion of new cleaning products coming into the market

380
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
Than any other

381
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
New blue cheer

382
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Raven dishes as well as long as our kitchen cabinets

383
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
In cupboard under the bathroom sink

384
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
Just getting like filled up with all of these things

385
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,471
Powders and liquids brightly colored bottles and boxes

386
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Never put into a box

387
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
And getting back to Lewis what he began to notice was that

388
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
More and more these doctors were coming across the hall of his Pharmacy the first one and then more and more and you know they're saying the k

389
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
We got this kid over in the ER Heat

390
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Just got into this new cleaning

391
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Stop and we have no idea what

392
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Can you help us

393
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
So the interns and residents and they emerge

394
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
PC room with naturally come across the hall to

395
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
And Lou help them find out what the child is taken for example if a child has swallowed a jacks

396
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
That meant he'd actually eaten

397
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
Sodium carbonate and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate

398
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
Wicked mean Dodger diarrhea

399
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
Or vomiting and Lewis

400
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
To keep cards on every

401
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,231
Product that was brought into the emergency room

402
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
Lloyd Wright Avenue card white sail bleach

403
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Sodium hypochlorite

404
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Chest pain vomiting

405
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
Safety gulou decided this was a

406
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
It was very needed because of the 1950's

407
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
3 / 250,000 different trade name substances on the market

408
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
The doctors they just couldn't keep up

409
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,503
And so loose stack of cards it grew taller and taller and taller and pretty soon

410
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Workout

411
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,879
Dog across the country would hear that there's this guy in Chicago who gives out help on poisoning

412
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
So many calls are coming in at all hours of the day and night eventually could only just started telling the switchboard operator they could go ahead and transfer the call

413
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
She was home

414
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,167
We would get calls from all the different little love

415
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,775
Emergency rooms in the hospitals in the state and what was what was it like

416
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
Once you're doing this then

417
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
It seems to me that you don't really have normal hours

418
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Because emergencies will take place whenever they take place

419
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
So yes

420
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,343
How did what was he going to be on call 24 hours a day

421
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
You leave yet

422
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Yes he was

423
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
Bleyblades get calls in the middle of the night

424
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
It already even during dinner time

425
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
So what happens if you know he's in the tub

426
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
And you're cooking dinner

427
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
And the phone rings

428
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
I would take the phone to him

429
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
A tender

430
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
That's the way it started

431
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Eventually

432
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
Little operation became the first Poison Control Center in the United States

433
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
1953

434
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
In Chicago

435
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,695
102 to 21222

436
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
1 800

437
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Boysen is the kind of thing you'll know

438
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Not supposed to touch

439
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
Old prescriptions cleaning stuff for spider bites and such

440
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
If you swallowed something bad or think you took too much

441
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Call the Poison Control Center hotline will the people you can try

442
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Supposed

443
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719

450
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

451
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
And I'm here because I need your

452
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
And I've requests

453
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

454
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Aunts and uncles teachers

455
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,719
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

456
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Basically I want to hear about this

457
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
Did you know did something

458
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
It just means you lean back and say

459
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Wow

460
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,567
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

461
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
To you

462
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

463
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,735
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

464
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Or maybe the kids in math

465
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
In the margin of their geometry

466
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
We're interested in the

467
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Epic moments where

468
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
A kid does something super smart

469
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
It doesn't have anything to do with it

470
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
If you have a story

471
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840

21 Chad Robert

479
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,256
Radiolab so we are back with reporter Brenda Farrell who is continuing

480
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
In to mm

481
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
To inquire into things poisonous before the break we just learned about Louis God Amun who started the oldest boys

482
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Control center in the country back in 1950

483
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,056
53 in Chicago today now we have

484
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
55 poison control centers

485
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
All across the country

486
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,480
And it's one phone number that anyone anywhere in the US can call

487
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Whenever they need

488
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Are there at certain times

489
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,416
Is there a rhythm to the day generally

490
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
Pattern it's busy in the morning and our kids are getting ready for school and Apache language for work for brushing your teeth

491
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
With muscle rub

492
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
Cream kids drinking a little mouthwash

493
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,008
Need some sunscreen eating some old mayonnaise

494
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,872
In the morning healthy parent will give the kids a adhd medication

495
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
In the mid-afternoon

496
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Kind of tapers down a little bit

497
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Is the slowest

498
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
And then the evening

499
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Busiest time of the day overall

500
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
What is like between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.

501
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,768
People coming home from work trying to get dinner super glue instead of eye drops super glue in

502
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Lip gloss

503
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
People take the

504
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,912
The Dodger cast Medicine by mistake instead of the normal medication

505
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,776
Yeah that that's a frequent scenario it gets to be

506
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Adults I have literally

507
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Care of all the things that have been used inside

508
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
It's just busy

509
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
You know just the heck

510
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
The schedule that we're living in

511
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
And right now

512
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Romans old stack of

513
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
The car that become this huge database

514
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,904
Facebook tracking like in real time

515
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
These things that are cropping up

516
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Salmonella

517
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
Weather that salmonella outbreak

518
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
Or like

519
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
That's nice

520
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,800
A weird drug reaction that people are having or maybe it's a new product at

521
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,640
Unexpectedly dangerous or laundry detergent pods

522
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Candy

523
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Now they are being linked

524
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
Tragic death of a child they can see that

525
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,576
In real-time Inlet Health officials or whoever else knowing

526
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Which is pretty cool but

527
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,232
I mean honestly just selfishly thinking about myself as a mom

528
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,584
Coming out of the trip to poison control I remember writing down

529
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
Miss feeling of like

530
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
What if I just approached

531
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
All the scary decisions in my life the way that poison control

532
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Like what like kind of thinking like

533
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
What would Poison Control do you like I just

534
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
It felt like

535
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,920
Such a relief to be experiencing

536
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Phenobarbital

537
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
64.89

538
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
And how much does she weigh is super rational place because just completely rational

539
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
And when did it happen

540
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
How long ago

541
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
We have this data we're going to

542
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
What's the name of The Prado

543
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Take these questions from you

544
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Let me see if this is even going to be a pro

545
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
And then we're going to

546
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Tell you

547
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
This is what we think is going to happen

548
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Back pain nausea

549
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,080
And they'll let you make a decision or they'll tell you like straight up don't worry about it

550
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
She's going to be a okay

551
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
I'm here on out and then take it again but you will be okay

552
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Okay

553
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
It just felt like it's it's

554
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,784
Stripped Away a lot of the

555
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
Like the guild and the anxiety and the like should I do this and politics and all those other things that have often swear

556
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Around even seemingly

557
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
Tumi inocuos questions about

558
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,608
How do I keep this person with little person safe and healthy

559
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
There's all the stuff swirling around it and they just

560
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
We didn't have to get into any of that

561
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
The iso range for me the most interesting part of this is that

562
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
The idea that we're supposed to know things like

563
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
You know I talked about this with my dad I mean

564
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
There was this time in medicine when

565
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
It was all about the doctor

566
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
In the white coat is

567
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Paternalistic

568
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Doctor knows best

569
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,256
And no one wants to go back there about that that there was something emotionally clean about that

570
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
Where is now

571
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
We have all the information it's right there is

572
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Hand in hand

573
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
With the rise of the internet

574
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
It's so increasingly

575
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
We're expected

576
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
To be our own

577
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Experts

578
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
And it's usually presented as

579
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,920
This sort of simple idea that information is power

580
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
And it isn't power I mean it is but it's also paralysis

581
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah

582
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,368
Actually had a rule where I wouldn't I would only let Nick look things up

583
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,720
Cuz I couldn't like I was not certain I was pregnant I like but have a panic attack

584
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
Is there so many different things and like always the top searches are the ones that like you're going to die

585
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
Oh yeah and he's really eat you like you get to the comments field

586
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
Right

587
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
I mean there's something about when you look at an answer on a

588
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,128
Screen and you just one click away from an exact opposite answer

589
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,968
And then when you're on the phone with someone it's just you and that person

590
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Like there is no other.

591
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Traction

592
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
I guess something built into the technology

593
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
The crates

594
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
Exactly the kind of connection you need it that much

595
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
Little people when they call you it's emergency there there

596
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
They're panicking and I think half the battle is getting them

597
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Settle down

598
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,216
So this is Tony Berta the know everything I we mentioned earlier

599
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,312
81 then that calm voice for 30 years

600
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
And while he was in pharmacy school he had an accident

601
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
I actually started pharmacy school

602
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
As excited

603
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Person but I finished as a blind

604
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
Individual

605
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
What what happened

606
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
He didn't want to say

607
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
But sitting there

608
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Scene of doing all of this math and spitting out these numbers receptor sites and half lives and volumes of distribution

609
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
Totally incomprehensible to me

610
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,984
But he told me that he also look pretty quickly and too

611
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Discovered early on that there was this whole other

612
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
Part of doing this job

613
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
Since September of 82

614
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Lucy I would have

615
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Probably head like a year-and-a-half

616
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Experience at that time

617
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
I remember I was

618
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
Sitting in the poison Center

619
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Another Pharmacy

620
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
And we had the news radio

621
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
I am station on

622
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
It's about 10:30 in the morning

623
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
News flash

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
A bizarre and terrifying stories in the Chicago suburbs

625
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Golan Heights and elk grove village

626
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
A twelve-year-old girl and two men who were brothers

627
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,592
Poison capsules of extra strength Tylenol

628
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Several people died from

629
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Sinai that the belief was

630
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Tylenol

631
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Chicago that

632
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Number might be changed

633
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
What's Cyanide and the terrifying moments

634
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
Thousands of people just simultaneously were all thinking oh my God this thing I brought into my home and make me feel better

635
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
You can kill me

636
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Today across

637
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
Tylenol products were being pulled from the show

638
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,752
The police are like driving that car slowly down the street with loudspeakers real eggs

639
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,384
Take back your Tylenol.

640
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
Restraints the time being until you hear otherwise

641
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
I thought you know till he told me he's sitting there hearing these news broadcast going across the radio and you just turn to the guy sitting next

642
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,416
To him in the Poison Control Center is that

643
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
We're going to get killed

644
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,376
Has been ringing off the hook at rush Presbyterian

645
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,960
St Luke's Medical Center in Chicago

646
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
Since you hung up the phone on the phone ring again

647
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,456
15 seconds color of Pharmacists and I just grabbed the references and

648
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
Try to make ourselves cyanide expert Co real fast

649
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
An interesting thing about

650
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
This case

651
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,184
Is that in every single one of these calls that was coming in

652
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Provides almost panicked

653
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
But they weren't actually in any danger

654
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
If anyone has taken

655
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,080
So in some way this moment if you think about it it it really kind of

656
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
High like this thing that

657
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
It is really at the heart of poison

658
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
The Specialist

659
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Not only were, but they hate their job was to just reassure like they were letting people know it was going to be okay

660
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
But if you flash forward to now that's changing it

661
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,744
They're getting more calls that are more serious I getting calls from hospitals

662
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,120
Again calls from people who've taken multiple drugs and so does that mean that they're getting less calls from like

663
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Normal

664
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,240
People and parents and I are going down and that end my calls overall

665
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
Sense like that in the past decade there been fewer calls

666
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
The Poison Control

667
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
Do you know why

668
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
My son

669
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:13,504
We don't like to make phone calls anymore but people don't there that you know the internet is there

670
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
And that's what we're used to and that's easy

671
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,880
Until they are they just launched this new

672
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,488
But instead of calling you can go to the website and plug-in answers to the questions

673
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
That they roll through

674
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
And it will give you the same answer based on

675
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,120
Hopefully the same knowledge but then

676
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
As a person who's lived

677
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,496
Through it I'm like oh my God please don't take away that phone call cuz it

678
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,896
When you're in that Panic the thought of having to sit and type an answer out while you're holding your kid and like wondering if you real

679
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Really screwed up

680
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,016
And it's like you're taking away something really valuable that maybe

681
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
We're not valuing here

682
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
I did have this one event

683
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
When my older son I've got

684
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Tucson

685
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,232
It was very little we were living in Sacramento

686
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,560
That by the way is author Deborah Blum again and

687
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
They didn't have fluoridated water

688
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
So

689
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
Doc gave them

690
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Honey Mead

691
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,776
Cute they were really cute fruit flavored fluoride pills

692
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
What kind of thing you could get a toddler to take

693
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
I don't know that we were doing but somehow we

694
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:19,040
Have you given him his daily fluoride pill and then like idiots left it on the kitchen counter

695
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,880
And he grabbed it and pretty much inhaled the whole bottle

696
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
And I was

697
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Really

698
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
I just didn't know how poisonous that was going to be like oh poison control

699
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,472
Am I supposed to know what I wanted to know was whether I should pan

700
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Right I mean

701
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,848
He seemed fine it wasn't like he was getting sick and anyway

702
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,920
And they were completely non freaked out about

703
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
Yeah you remember here

704
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
Did you hear their words or did you hear their tone

705
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
It was the tone

706
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
They were so calm

707
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Add

708
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
They could tell I was

709
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
And Anakin just

710
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,632
Tell you I'm standing in the kitchen we had this phone

711
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:11,520
My son's by me you know he can tell I'm free but he doesn't really know I'm free and I sat on the

712
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
After I talk to them

713
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Sat down on the floor with him

714
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Just so great

715
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
And I was

716
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
And that's what I remember

717
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
Is how grateful

718
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,696
