1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
Are you surprised that this is so popular

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
Surprised

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,184
You know what I'm surprised about I'm surprised that

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,536
This morning I was walking the subway and I was like man I want to live

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
I guess I'm a little surprised that myself

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Take a note Robert

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,480
Fantastic day and it was amazing

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Undeniable

12
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,600
Okay I'm Janice and Robert Radiolab

13
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Today a story

14
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Arab order Alex Jung Hye

15
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
You podcast to go about Gary Hart

16
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
And the moment

17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
When how we covered politics changed this story is about a similar changes happening right now right in front of her

18
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Rides in South Korea we're going to travel a few thousand miles

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
Expecting this kind of story

20
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Get totally flipped

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,184
It's not about politics this time it's about music

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,816
Young fans music pieces you already heard but really it's a puzzle

23
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
If you really admire someone and love them is how much

24
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
How much do you want to know about

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Stop the music

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
Yeah is it tell me everything

27
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Or tell me nothing

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
And if someone does try and tell you everything at what point do you say

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Stop

30
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Ready I'm ready

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Where do where do you wear shoes

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,560
Well I think if we get to like the moment that I am very excited about I need to kind of give you guys

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
A little bit of of the world and which all of this

34
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Is going to happen

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
And so we're going to start

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
With this woman when I told my friends about it

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
I kind of described it as a prison

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
What is a prison you decide to walk into

39
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Okay so this

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
This is Sarah Wolfgang I was a former trainee for

41
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
K-Pop group in

42
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Korea

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
And I'm here to talk about that

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Sarah is korean-american she was born in America but I actually grew up in Korea

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Parents

46
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,376
Both worked for the military and you are living in Seoul

47
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
And Sarah says that her whole

48
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Kpop Adventures

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,080
It all started with her because when she was growing up I really never liked

50
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,920
School so my parents were kind of wanting me to do so

51
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Something else

52
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
You still wanted me to finish

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
School but

54
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
They encourage her to try at acting

55
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
2Go. Additions tryout for

56
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
School plays

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
And High School

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
15 years old

59
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,048
10th grade at her headshots ended up getting passed to a South

60
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Screen record

61
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
And

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
When we were see the phone call they were like oh hey you want to come in audition for a K-Pop group and I was

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
I actually did I did I really didn't want

64
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
To do it but then she thought maybe this will lead to an acting job so I went in and then they're like okay they put me in front of

65
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
The camera and then they asked me to

66
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
2

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Sing

68
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
And I'm not

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
The best singer

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
No matter the K-pop

71
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
Everything you know can be touched up

72
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Really well

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
To make a long story short they end up offering

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Of more than 5 year

75
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
And as part of that contract

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
We were asked to move into the dorms

77
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
What are these

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Facilities that's all the agencies

79
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Is Hartford for their idols

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Training we described it like a

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,248
The boarding school all the kids kind of live together

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
6

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Or seven other girls

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:12,416
And it was here that Sarah says the company basically kept them under lock and key

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Lock Us in there

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
But we weren't allowed to

87
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
It's like one of those cockroach

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Prisons

89
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Or like those ant prison

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
You can walk in but you can't lock out your way why is she doing this again

91
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
What

92
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
Let me explain to you guys just like how phenomena

93
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Really huge

94
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
K-pop

95
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Kpop actually started in Korea in the early 90s

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
But like in the last five or so years if he's just build out into the

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
The world

98
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
And by some estimates it was generating like around 5

99
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Billion dollars

100
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
And then if you throw in like

101
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Kdrama K soap operas

102
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
We just called the how you wave

103
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
That how you wave in 2012 was valued at 83 billion dollars

104
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
Jesus

105
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
And nearly all of this

106
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Is based on a kind of

107
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Fantasy

108
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Because K-pop stars are

109
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
You know products of fantasy world

110
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
That's professor

111
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,095
Computer studies at University of California Santa Barbara I study K-pop industry

112
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
You know

113
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,727
Stars are the important forms of Manga and Anime and all these

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Unrealistic

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Figures

116
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
That don't exist in real life

117
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
So

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
They have to have

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Just so really beautiful face beautiful body and excessively long legs

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Pale skin flowing hair they're not

121
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
The creature of this world

122
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
They should have been

123
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Yeah what they own that can only

124
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Exist in fantasy world and that fantasy that's what they're trying to manufacture

125
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
In those storms

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Like they wanted us to lose weight

127
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
So

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
We would wake up at like

129
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
For 5 a.m. in the morning and then go hiking Sarah says after the height they'd come back eat breakfast which usually cancel

130
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
Turn up lettuce and they have dance classes singing classes and then we have lessons of I think

131
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,695
They're calling humble lessons we're basically this guy would show up to the dorm

132
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
To Bow correctly

133
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,863
So like we would have to down Unison so that we seemed as like one big happy group

134
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,935
They weren't allowed to have cell phone computers

135
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Or

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
A relationship of any kind

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
All companies pretty much

138
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Don't want you

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
You to be in a relationship

140
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
And in fact

141
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
Chicken told me that in 2011

142
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
The one of the members of

143
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
21 which of the girl group managed by YG Entertainment

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Revealed.

145
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,279
The management said they should not be dating before age 29

146
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
What

147
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,471
They should be dating because Stars belong to the public to the fam

148
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
And I was like a purity thing

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Now that pure and angelic

150
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Virgin Madonna image

151
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,087
This by the way is K-pop writer AJ park editor-at-large at soompi.com

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Like girl groups

153
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Please call Mike Nations fairies

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
You know they had this

155
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Securitas

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
Image to them in the boy bands 2

157
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Because.

158
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Being single

159
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
Make some more marketable and appealing

160
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Images of vets that's the main take

161
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Of course there's all kinds of

162
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Cultural observation

163
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
Things that you can make about this but the main driver here

164
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Economic

165
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
The founders of Kpop new

166
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:49,503
In the early nineties at the fans would love to starves even more if the stars weren't just beautiful

167
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Perfect

168
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
But they also seemed

169
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Somehow available

170
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,719
You would be surprised how many K-pop stars come out and be like I've never had my first kiss

171
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Cadillac 1920

172
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
8 years old

173
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
I haven't had my first kiss will it be with you you know ink feeding the fantasy kind of thing

174
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
America I mean

175
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Didn't you feel weirder

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Are stranger or something or what

177
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Win like

178
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
I don't know

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
Catherine Zeta-Jones married that guy

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Whatever his name is

181
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
Yeah yeah I don't even think about its name

182
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
Okay you always going on about Meryl Streep

183
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,119
Is she married for them to me but not she doesn't know it she is married to a to a very quiet man is a Sculptor

184
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
How does it make you feel how I look around to show to see

185
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
What is he

186
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
My point is is it that I mean America the American celebrity culture has fantasy woven into

187
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Yeah but there's a big difference

188
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Friends in Korea

189
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
The fantasy world it is

190
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Seoul

191
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Friendly control

192
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Way more than in America

193
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
According to Sikhism

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
And it's controlled not just by the agency

195
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,535
Foot by the fence to the extent that it defies all of our common sense

196
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Meaning I'll give you an example

197
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
That's what I heard from Professor

198
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Kim and also writer

199
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,751
Bacco on the editor-in-chief of Soul Beats KPOP

200
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Okay

201
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
2008 there was this new girl group

202
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Girls Generation Girls Generation

203
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
Girls Generation member all girls group that was like

204
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
Ocean appearing on live music shows and like

205
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,023
Variety shows being promoted as like

206
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Cute and you know like the ideal girlfriend kind of idea

207
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
Girls Generation would appear with boy bands you know who are also promoting at the same time

208
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,687
Fruit such as Super Junior

209
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Ss501

210
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
Dbsk

211
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Like standing next to each other on stage talking to each other during variety shows

212
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
And this is where we kind of get into the cultural

213
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,471
There are several times when they're on stage with one or more of these boy band

214
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
And there

215
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Kind of taking the microphone from the host or whatever

216
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
And kind of just nodding their head where the boy bands are like doing these

217
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Deep bow

218
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
Some of the fans are seeing this and they're thinking that

219
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Disrespectful

220
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,415
Why would that be respectful thinking is that since Girls Generation is a new group

221
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
They should be buying much more deeply than theirs

222
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
In base or there their seniors

223
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Bing

224
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
A rookie group is a big deal in Korea because

225
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Seniority is something that people hold very strongly

226
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
And so as a rookie you have to show deference to the superior Hino senior groups

227
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:01,759
Just in the box that's how some of the fans were taking it but I mean aside from all that and this is the key is that

228
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
Some of the fans thought that the Girls Generation girls were

229
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Flirting

230
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
With some of the boy bands

231
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
Little Saigon glances or

232
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
Teasing them it so that interaction seeing that

233
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Fans were very very very

234
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Upset about that

235
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
And so

236
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
All the fans of the

237
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Three groups that three boy bands

238
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Got together

239
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
And decided to do a black ocean

240
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
What is that

241
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Get that ring

242
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Fast forward to June 7th 2008 all of those bands that were on those TV shows are playing this big

243
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
K-pop concert

244
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Event called

245
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Train concert

246
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,791
A huge stadium shows like more than 40000 fans and

247
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
Told me that there's one thing you need to know about vans

248
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
About K-pop

249
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
At Atlanta

250
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
They all have lights.

251
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
And they come in different colors give each man has its own color

252
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Super Junior for example has and when they appear on stage you see this

253
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
Blue light sticks waiting in support of their stars on stage

254
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Do they play for a while

255
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
When ss501 comes out

256
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Cool place Jeff turns to light green Show Goes On

257
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
TVXQ come from stage they were like the biggest fan of

258
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,383
The time and then up code Thousand thousands of these ruby red

259
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Literally

260
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
At some point Girls Generation

261
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
And here's a pretty much as soon as they walk on stage

262
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
All the people in the audience

263
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Turn off

264
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Their lightstick

265
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
What suddenly

266
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
It was blackout in the whole Auditorium

267
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Everybody stop clapping screaming

268
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Silence

269
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
We seem like a whole like everybody 40,000 people yes

270
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,615
And if you look at look up pictures of it it's it was a stadium performance

271
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
The entire stadium was black

272
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
No way yes way

273
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
What is this picture

274
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Oh my God

275
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,439
So this is totally black

276
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
This is a Photoshop no cuz if you look down in the corner you can kind of see the pink

277
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
Girls Generation section pink

278
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Nails black

279
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
Girls Generation had to sing and dance

280
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Stoodis Island

281
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Krowd

282
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
Had anything like this ever happened before

283
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
How on Earth did they pull that off

284
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
How could you get this many people doing the same thing

285
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Okay so the way that these

286
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Show is happy

287
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,743
At least at these dream concert is at different sections of the auditorium belong to different fan

288
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,887
Oh so they sell it is Zone seating

289
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
There's this moment where some of the fan club leaders

290
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
I stood up

291
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
And held up the signs

292
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Quiet

293
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
This that this is.

294
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Setting

295
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:18,111
Yeah

296
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
He soon I've ever heard

297
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,999
A little blink of an eye but that's

298
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
Is the difference if you if you would allow me to frame for a second

299
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,191
What are we learned so far we've learned that this is a global phenomenon

300
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
Total make the global phenomenon born of the nightmare

301
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Of these Stars

302
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
Who seem to be tightly held in check by everybody

303
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Play the fans the agency's everybody

304
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
And this sort of tight

305
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Control is how it operated

306
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Quite a few decades

307
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
But

308
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
And this is why I want to do this whole story in the first place

309
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Just a couple years ago

310
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
In walks this guy

311
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,679
And he just messes everything up

312
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Radiolab

313
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
We sent interpreter with a makeover

314
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
To the Gangnam

315
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Insult

316
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Gangnam Style

317
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Names meaning Young Girl

318
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
But you know he told me to call him mister

319
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Hello

320
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Hello hey

321
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,975
I hopped on the line for my studio New York get started

322
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Yeah you

323
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
Okay so here's the story in early 2000s

324
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,007
Literally he was working at a news organization called

325
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Sports

326
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
We should all kinds of things not

327
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
They also

328
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Business

329
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Taemin

330
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Documentary on eating for money

331
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Who's actually in charge of

332
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
All the online

333
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
While he was there I think

334
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Say that he took

335
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
His reporting

336
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Very seriously

337
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
What he always had this idea in his

338
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
20 month old

339
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
Who do I see about in Islam believe any content that can be published that's possible to

340
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Popular should be freely published

341
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,359
What kind of culture that would be better to have but he was a guy who believed in an independent

342
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Real Sonu

343
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759
That there are certain things that he just couldn't report on

344
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Hamilton

345
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Counselor

346
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,183
Certain subjects like politics

347
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Dangerous

348
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
How

349
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Hawaii

350
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
What did we talk about

351
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
We we actually need to back up a little bit

352
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Put this into a little bit of

353
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Contacts

354
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Between like after the Korean War

355
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Screensavers

356
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Cities in the 80

357
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,055
South Korea was under a series of military dick

358
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
And there was

359
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Basically a censorship of the press

360
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Things a lot better in the 90s when

361
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
They turn to civilian rule

362
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,183
But even today the government still has a branch that goes around the internet and

363
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
And delete website

364
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Further content

365
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
So this is this is like

366
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
The world in which the

367
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
The Press is living in it

368
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
So getting back to mr. Lee

369
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
2010

370
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
Sportsseoul having dreams of Independence

371
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
Feels like politics is a little tricky

You know how they take their pictures how close do they get cuz there isn't there was Paparazzi

383
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
And we decided to apply that to South Korea so what kind what kind of tactics did you use to

384
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,983
To get the photos in the first place

385
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383

389
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Cute band

390
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599

Thank you. Come get y'all seen in today

393
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
To go through

394
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
The information gathering Pro

395
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,631
Process to the tailed both these stars on and off

396
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
1 months

397
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Well she's dead

398
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Sense of their movement

399
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
You know and they figure out they have this pattern of meeting up

400
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
In front of her apartment

401
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Really early in the morning like 3 in the morning

402
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
And they take these walks

403
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
So

404
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
Late October 2010 if it came to a point where we could we couldn't miss the opportunity

405
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Call this I guess they call this the D-Day

406
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Could imagine that if you didn't go down

407
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
The dating date but I think is

408
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Pretty funny

409
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
And on this particular day one of Mr Wiesel

410
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Reporters steaks out the

411
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
The apartment

412
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
And the two stars meet up to

413
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
To take a walk

414
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
And

415
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
You get the very first

416
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Paparazzi photos

417
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
As far as we know in Korea

418
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
Where the first look like

419
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
The Bistro Reserve

420
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
So

421
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
But I think they're so cute it's these two items

422
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
You know walking down the street

423
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Hand in hand

424
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Under these yellow street lights

425
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,047
Images look like they're in their own little world there's this one photo where he's

426
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
Pulling back her hair

427
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,447
And I think he's putting like an earbud in her Pierre and there may be there sharing

428
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,823
The song you're listening to a song together he's got her purse on his shoulder you know he

429
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Holding her bags

430
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,735

Coming through a car window do they see the guy know they don't and that's why these photos there it's not like that typical like hand in the face

Ketones

447
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Miserly said right before they published

448
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
And this is sort of become their tradition

449
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
All of the reporters got together and stayed in the office all night

450
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Pins and needles

451
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727

Totally excited about this

454
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
They just had no idea what

455
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
What is going to happen

456
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
And you also will have no idea what's going to happen

457
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Until after the break

458
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464

Ductwork

465
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,896
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

466
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
And I'm here because I need your

467
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
And I request

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,416
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

469
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

470
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Brilliance

471
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Basically I want to hear about this

472
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
Times when a kid you know did something

473
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
It just means you lean back and say

474
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Wow

475
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
How did they do that

476
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Maybe it was the moment that I

477
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,336
Kids started reading back

478
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
To you

479
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

480
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,760
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

481
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music

482
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
In the margin of the geometry

483
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,512
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

484
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

485
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
If you have a story

00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608

They all got together in their office they were just about to publish no idea what was going to happen and

510
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
When we first

511
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Publish them

512
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Nothing

513
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Really really

514
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Seriously oh come on I'm kidding

People are crazy

517
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,136
Oh my goodness the photos went viral

518
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,768
It just took the whole country

519
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
There was an incredible amount of web traffic

520
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,472
So much that our servers were breaking down

521
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Two people click

522
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,592
Oh yeah what it all comes down to it people really want to know

523
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
At first they just you know they did

524
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
Inundated the website china wiki

525
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Photos

526
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
But then they were like oh

00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Oh no

528
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
So then they rushed over to the fancy

529
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
And

530
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
Four of the websites from the the boy band the guy

531
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Crash

532
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,768
Infections website which is called mini humpy page

533
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:38,400

534
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680

535
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Typical

537
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Texas Waze

Front

540
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
This is always the way it is right

541
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,248
Just like an America that's the way it happens in Korea

542
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
You know when I talked to leaving you he was the first one to recognize

543
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Klonopin

544
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
Usually when this kind of Scandal breaks it's the

545
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
The woman who gets it worse

546
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Yeah yeah

547
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584

Shock

551
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
In the beginning totality

552
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Companies were not

553
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Cuz their official statement would be like weed and talk to

554
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
About this like where we had no idea

555
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
And you could see that the companies are struggling

556
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,088
There's actually you know a couple times later on where

557
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,976
Got the fans got really crazy and they would actually

558
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Protest

559
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
At like their live shows

560
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,120
And then pretty much the next day like after the protest

561
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
The idle at the center of that Sandalwood

562
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
Kind of vanish

563
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Like they were just

564
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Take a indefinite

565
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
Hiatus from Alder

566
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Promotional Act

567
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152
Like you mean like the agency's just yank them

568
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
I mean yeah that was

569
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
The suggestion yeah

570
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,272
Did the agency say anything about that to you no one would go on the record

571
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
With me but I did talked

572
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
To some people over email

573
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
And they said that

574
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
You know

575
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
When fans react

576
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Weather kind of

577
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Forced to

578
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
To take drastic action

579
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
So they

580
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:14,144
Kind of confirmed that they were disappearing items confirmed with me that they were

581
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912

582
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008

585
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,040
Show them that you what worked in the

586
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:37,440
Foreign media could also work in South Korea

587
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
Keep experimenting so in 2011 we were in Doom and like a couple of the people from Sports off a bridge

00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
It is really important

592
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Chunk of time

593
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200

00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
But according to pekin Kim

605
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,664
You had so many scandals

606
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
Such a short. Of time headlines after headline headline

607
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,208
Such a frequent right that we need fence became somehow

608
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
Desensitized by this news

609
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560

610
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:51,168

A couple things so the paparazzi became a trend something that all the crane and payment new starting pay

614
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
There starts to be all these other

615
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Paparazzi come

616
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,552
Movies that come out exactly just like dispatch but

617
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
A different name but the craziest

618
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Part I think

619
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
Is that you start seeing celebrities

620
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Tiptoeing out and

621
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Telling the truth

622
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
About their lives

623
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
Little by little the celebrities would get more comfortable about revealing at the

624
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Princeton

625
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:26,240
Winchester 12 on his talk show song He Who is a member of

626
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
K-pop boy band

627
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
He made waves because he

628
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
Celebrities dating car

629
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:43,392
From all these new Paparazzi they parked by the Han River and they have their dates there and

630
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
There a parking lot

631
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
For multiple celebrities

632
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Park

633
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
And have their secret dates inside the car

634
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
This is something that people always started

635
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
Suspected was the case but it was kind of the first time he was

636
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Out in the open like that

637
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,104
I think that the audience reaction

638
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
It is like super telling

639
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,480
Cuz they're laughing

640
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
So he's breaking the spell

641
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
And what you expect

642
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
Yeah what you get is

643
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
Casual laughter

644
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
2 years

645
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
We have probably say 5 year

646
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Yeah but still I mean if that's

647
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
See this sexy bears make me think

648
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Bengals first voltage

00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Paparazzi

650
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Is liberators

651
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Totally totally

652
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Cuz we used to think

653
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Scump

654
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
What does it mean if your pan out

655
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
He literally the thought of

656
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
Like it's a tendency cuz we're

657
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
See what

658
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Happens in

659
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Places like Korea

660
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
It's being very different

661
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
What's the culturally separate

662
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Yeah

663
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,976
Batista here they changed that quickly makes me think in some way that we're all very similar

664
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
How many world headed

665
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
To the same place

666
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Tabloid is the great equalizer

667
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
And maybe we were all going to just end up

668
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
All of us in

669
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
Post Kardashian hell like literally like this is how far they traveled in five years and it literally

670
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
5 years you will have

671
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
Take the Kardashian family of Korea

672
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
I also thought the same thing

673
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
You know being from America really well this is

674
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,720
Is inevitable but I actually don't see

675
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Think so anymore

676
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
AJ told me a story that

677
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
Really change my mind

678
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
It was like

679
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
It was our Watergate

680
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
What are K-pop

681
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
It was a taint everything

682
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
The story of it

683
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
Revolves around

684
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,384
This one young female solo artists

685
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,712
Bailey

686
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Jesus

687
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Hugely popular I mean they actually call her the Korean Beyonce

688
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
And in 2013 she was just

689
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,328
Killing it by this point a lie has

690
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:04,192
Albums out her YouTube videos have millions and millions of views

691
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
But then

692
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
November 2013

693
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
A bomb drop

694
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
What happens is this

695
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
This guy called calls dispatch

696
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Mr.lee Ashley

697
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
And he recorded this phone call

698
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Between them

699
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
And the guy tells him

700
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
I have nude

701
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464

IndyCar

703
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,120
Mr. Lee tells the guy we need to know how your

704
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,704
Guy says

705
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Perceive them

706
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
From hell

707
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
The singer

708
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Yes

709
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Why

710
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
I was her boyfriend

711
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:01,024
What is exactly the Eye Associates calling dispatch to see how much these nude photos are worth

712
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
And when I was talking to mr. Lee about this

713
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
He said that in that moment

714
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
When he was on the phone

715
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Britannia

716
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
As a reporter

717
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
I was greedy about the

718
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
Story and the information he said that he

719
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Wanted those

720
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Pictures

721
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
But what he ends up telling the guy is

722
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
We don't want your

723
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
And then if you keep listening to the phone call YouTube

724
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,144
They're getting really upset with the ex

725
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Boyfriend

726
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Like this is not right you're crossing a line

727
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,080
How to make a long story short dispatch turns down the photos

728
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
And the photos

729
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Somehow

730
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
Make their way to a competitor

731
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
This one

732
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
American

733
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Kpop website

734
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Call doll

735
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
Kpop pretty big number 1

736
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Kpop site at that time

737
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
In the world

738
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
For English

739
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
English speaker

740
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
The published naked

741
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Pictures of are the ones

742
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
How to publish then the naked pic

743
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
Camper if they sent it or not

744
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
If they did it wasn't a very good job that you could see

745
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
So

746
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
The photos come out and what would you expect to happen

747
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
Some anger may be a little bit and then basically people

748
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Just click on the pictures

749
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
No

750
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
What actually happen

751
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,808
Instantly the entire K-pop

752
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
World band

753
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
Together Black Ocean Style

754
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Comes out against alipay

755
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
The agencies they start threatening to Sue this competitor website starts with boycott and Injustice

756
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:44,192
Few days this figure like 22000 Twitter followers to stop following

757
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Really they're their reputation

758
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
It was a warning to that

759
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,408
You don't don't mess with us and so they really haven't

760
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
I mean I haven't really followed them in awhile but they haven't

761
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
But what I think is the most surprising part of the

762
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
3 days after the photos

763
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Come out

764
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,744
Twas the Night of one of his biggest award ceremonies

765
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Called the melon music

766
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,888
And

767
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
You know scheduled for that night Haley was supposed to receive

768
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
One of these top 10 artists

769
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
The Year award

770
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
I think everyone's surprise

771
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
She actually showed up

772
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Melon Music Awards

773
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
The top 10

774
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
In about 2 hours in

775
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah they call her name

776
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Costanza

777
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Wausau Center Stage

778
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Lippizaners

779
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
The bow and

780
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
She looks

781
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
I think she looks

782
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
Sprouts or at least overwhelmed

783
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
But then

784
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,592
She faces the crowd

785
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
At one point her face, crack

786
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,112
She puts her head in her elbow

787
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
She started crying

788
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
She says

789
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
It really means a lot

790
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
That you supported me

791
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
But you believed in me

792
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Beetlejuice

793
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
Spy everything

794
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736

00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Thank you

796
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
And then

797
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
She walked off stage

798
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,336
For me the story shows that they're going to draw

799
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
A Line in the Sand

800
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
That's different from ours

801
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
For now

802
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
For a long time or

803
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Can you say

804
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
I mean

805
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
What I asked

806
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
AJ Park

807
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
The same question do you think that is going to go the way of the West

808
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,768
I mean she said no way I don't think it's ever going to be

809
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
That way I know

810
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
I mean culturally Korean store a little more strict

811
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,192
And also I think there's also a part where we look at the US

812
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,312
No like we see them as an example of let's not totally go there

813
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,992
So like a u.s. is a cautionary tale or don't ever get to that point guys

814
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
And maybe this is one of those ones where you really wonder like

815
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
Is there a cultural difference that runs deep enough

816
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
To York the part of you that

817
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
You think that ultimately there my vehicle

818

819
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
Make it so easy to know

820
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,592
The most intimate details about anyone

821
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
We'll all give in

822
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
