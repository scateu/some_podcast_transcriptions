1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:06,912
Hate Radiolab it is Molly Webster before we start the show I want to say two things

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,192
One of which

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Thank you

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,848
Couple of weeks ago we asked you to donate to support the show and you did

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,640
And we are so so grateful

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
Which brings me to the second thing

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
We still need more of you

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,552
This is a stat that I was handed today

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,880
Most people listen to Radiolab for about

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
Two and a half years before they become a member

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
Can you imagine that that's like

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
What's a going to a potluck dinner

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
For two-and-a-half years

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632
Every week

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
And never bringing a dish

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
Or going to

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
Two-and-a-half years of weddings and never bringing a gift

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,872
Or asking people to follow you never following them

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,016
You wouldn't want to do any of those things until I know that you want to become a member today

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,832
Go to radiolab.org

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Donate

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,976
The average donation is $75 but we're happy with whatever you can give

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
And

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
If you donate before April 30th you and a friend could win an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City

25
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
We

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
Will take you bowling once you get here

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
So go to radiolab.org donate

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
And thank you

29
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Are you awake

30
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,936
Listening to Radiolab

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,800
Radiolab WNYC

32
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm Jedi been wrought iron Robert Froehlich is Radiolab and this is reporter Julia Longoria

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Nothing. Let's do it so where do we start

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
You took a trip

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Site of two trips

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
The first trip inspired another trip

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Let's start in Denver Colorado

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Where

39
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
I wanted to speak to this

40
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
Young man

41
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,848
Giancarlo very young man

42
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Giancarlo Mari

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
He's 9 years old what are you doing today

44
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Well I'm from eating lunch

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,344
So currently I'm not asking my grandmother hug so yeah

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
So currently that

47
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Trying to turn me on

48
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
And

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
I wanted to talk to him because there's this

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,840
Particular chapter in his family history

51
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
That

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
Presented this thorny question to the United States of America

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Do you feel like you're like a descendant of immigrants

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Sort of like

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Not all the way like

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
You're in the car

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Carson immigrants

58
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Cuz

59
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
People from Puerto Rico back then like 19

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
98 I think

61
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
Maybe it was actually 1898

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
And what happened in 1898 was that the United States had gotten sort of gravity

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
We grabbed

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
The Philippines we grabbed

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Guam and we grabbed

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,312
Puerto Rico which is where John Carlos family was from and

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Just a few years after Puerto Rico became part of us

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736
Great grandmother it's either great great or grate

69
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
Grandmother don't remember you it was his great

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,464
Great grandmother and her name was Isabel Gonzalez

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
She was on a boat she was on like

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
Like they used to be like both

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
From going from here she was traveling alone and pregnant from

74
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Puerto Rico to New York City

75
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,592
When the boat arrived in Ellis Island white men

76
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Wood

77
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,504
Go out in like select like people like you can't go not allowed you can't go where's your spouse not allowed

78
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
She was stopped at Ellis Island because all women arriving

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
At Ellis Island who were pregnant

80
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
We're stopped and examined and some of them were turned away a little historical assistir from Christina Fonseca

81
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
I'm a professor of law at Columbia she says when those guys tried to pull Isabella side

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,823
Said you can't even stop me much less question me or get in my way at all

83
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,663
I am coming from Puerto Rico which is part of the United States

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
I'm an American citizen

85
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,367
And citizens cannot be stopped at the border Christina says around this time a lot of people a lot of goods

86
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,999
Like fruits and with a shipment of orange among other things started arriving in the US

87
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
From the newly acquired territory

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
And all of these new arrivals

89
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Posed a sort of existential question to the US

90
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Are these

91
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
New colonies

92
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Part of us

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Or are they something else

94
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
So a bunch of these cases like

95
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
Isabel Gonzalez's case ended up in the Supreme Court

96
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
And they eventually became known

97
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Collectively as

98
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
The insular

99
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
The insular cases

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
What does insular mean

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Miss contacts

102
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,023
Insular actually means relating to an island it also means

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Parochial or

104
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
Close minded at the time when the United States annexed

105
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,727
Puerto Rico the Philippines and Guam it still have territories that had Oklahoma to Arizona

106
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
But it had not yet become States

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
So territories were not new

108
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
However

109
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,711
These territories seemed very different to the American public they had different

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Cultures different

111
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Races

112
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
They didn't seem

113
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
American enough

114
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,743
So the judges are dealing with the fact that these new islands are now

115
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Part of the US

116
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
But they also have this public opinion in their heads and they don't want to let these people all the way in so in the

117
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
Case of Isabel Gonzalez they ended up saying we're not going to answer the question of whether Puerto Ricans are actually us

118
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Citizens

119
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
We're just going to say they're not immigrants

120
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
And if that's not confusing enough

121
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
They went on to say that Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is foreign to the United States in a domestic sense

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
That sounds like nonsense

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
The dissenters in the case

124
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
That it sounded like nonsense nobody understood exactly what that meant it's like almost textbook

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
Doublethink right like it's like foreign but the mess

126
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,823
Math textbook having it both ways

127
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
Do you feel like you're Puerto Rican

128
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Gordo Vegas

129
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
If y'all

130
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
American

131
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,415
Parsley just partially why

132
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Cuz I'm also

133
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Little bit

134
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Irish I think

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
The Irish

136
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
Well yeah on Dad side you know your friend

137
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
Just backup go ahead and say so today on Radiolab we're continuing our thought that we had in the last episode

138
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
So we did about citizenship about what it means to belong to a place or country

139
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,671
The last episode we spend some time in Switzerland think about cowbells but this time we've got a story that

140
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
It's a little bit closer to home

141
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Yeah and

142
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,887
This next part is really what blew me away and actually inspired my second

143
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,263
Shortly after the insular cases Congress stepped in and they pass the law to make it so that

144
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
Anybody born in Puerto Rico is an automatic US citizen

145
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Congress

146
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,503
Did the same thing for the other major territories I mean they can't vote for president they don't have a vote in Congress

147
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
But at least the people born in those territories are automatically

148
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
US citizens

149
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Except

150
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
41 place

151
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
A cluster of tiny little Islands in that great blue expanse the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii

152
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
New Zealand

153
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
Call American Samoa

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
The only place in the world

155
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
That is US soil and people who are born here are not citizens

156
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
So is it true yes

157
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Sissy

158
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,695
Attention existing only place where the whole like my baby is born the u.s. Air Force

159
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Doesn't happen

160
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Cracked

161
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
They become what are they

162
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
In their passport they have a US passport but on the last page it says

163
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
This person is not a US citizen

164
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
.

165
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
US national

166
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
A child born in American Samoa

167
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,943
Will not become an automatic citizen they have to go take the test they have to pay close to $800

168
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,575
And you can't even like there's no immigration office in American Samoa so you have to go

169
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
To some other part of the states

170
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Stay there for a few months

171
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
And apply in order to qualify

172
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
So it's it's

173
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
And it's not just weird I mean it

174
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
When I first looked into it it seems like this hold over from this

175
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
Really racist time in our history

176
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
But

177
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Then

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
I started making calls

179
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Two American Samoans

180
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Living in American Samoa

181
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
End

182
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
I realized

183
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
There might be

184
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
A more complicated reason why

185
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
American Samoans

186
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,047
Still are not US citizens after all these years

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
So I decided to get on a plane

188
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
After a 25 hour trip

189
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,431
I landed in the middle of the night

190
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,551
Went through border security

191
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
That I walked out of the

192
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
Of the airport which is really small

193
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,791
Very nice to meet you and

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
People I had email

195
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Showed up to the airport

196
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,495
To greet me with lady with like flowers and

197
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
And I appreciate that was just like the hotel picking me up but it was like this woman who I haven't even talked to you on the phone but you knew I was

198
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Coming from far away

199
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,207
And then more and more people who I talk to you showed up

200
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
Wait David So instantly it felt

201
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
So welcoming

202
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
Anyway I got to my hotel that night

203
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
And then the next morning

204
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
I stepped out of my hotel Ocean

205
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
You and it was

206
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Josh

207
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
Incredibly gorgeous, I saw the pictures of what no one told me

208
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Who is amazing

209
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Huge

210
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Lush

211
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Mountain

212
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Bright green mountains

213
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
Only palm trees pastel colored

214
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
Houses tucked into the side of these cliffs

215
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
American flag

216
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Flying high

217
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Just stunning

218
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
How big how big is American Samoa

219
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Well

220
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
It's a cluster of islands with the main island to Tukwila

221
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
Is about 50 square miles with about 50000

222
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
2

223
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Lane Road

224
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
Whiskey like the main route

225
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
There's just one main road

226
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
That you drive so if you if the oceans on your

227
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Right you're probably going east

228
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
If the oceans on your left you're probably going west

229
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Angie

230
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,167
I spent 12 days there and it was just kind of like riding back and forth and back and forth

231
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
With different people

232
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
With who had different ideas of

233
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
What the island was about

234
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
Which is really interesting seeing the same places

235
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Through different eyes

236
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
I'm so

237
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
It is this

238
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
The first stop I made was to meet with a guy named

239
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Hi

240
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Charles alive Lima

241
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Really smiley

242
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:21,375
Silver hair thin Rim glasses wearing a floral shirt and flip-flops

243
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Almost everybody at the courthouse was wearing flip-flops

244
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,383
When I caught up with him he was actually meeting with a couple of Samoan men who were in the middle of a Landis

245
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,711
Which is basically the rights of the Chiefs

246
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Coldest top of this mountain

247
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
But the reason I wanted to talk

248
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
Is that he has a case

249
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
Right now pending before the federal courts

250
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
That's basically

251
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Isabel Gonzalez in 2019

252
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
He's arguing that

253
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,495
Denying American Samoans Birthright citizenship

254
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Is unconstitutional

255
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
So I believe that

256
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
When you were born in American Samoa

257
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
You're American

258
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
An unusual American but you are still on now in Charles case he's with sometime ones call afakasi

259
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
My mother was born in

260
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
Auburn New York mom is white and his dad is from Western Samoa which is not part of the US

261
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Is parents actually met in the states

262
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
His dad was in grad school in DC

263
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
And

264
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
My father and mother could not get married in Virginia

265
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Because of the

266
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,567
Anti-miscegenation laws this was back in 19 over East

267
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Cuz I'm a mother kept trying to insist

268
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
The Samoans are not

269
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
Black they are something different because now he looks too. But they were actually able to get married

270
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Hayden Washington DC

271
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,415
And they moved to American Samoa where Charlie was born

272
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
And you think that Charlie would be an automatic US citizen

273
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
And this is a child is born in the u.s. territory but she had to go cuz they had to register at the closest Embassy

274
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
His mom a US citizen actually had to register him in a foreign country

275
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
The closest Embassy with all the way in New Zealand

276
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
You know it doesn't make any sense in it

277
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
And it's against the principles of the United States really says the fact that American Samoans are not autumn

278
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,183
Ematic citizens by birth is hiding a lot of in justices that are going on

279
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
Justices that could be remedied

280
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
If you didn't say oh well we are your National

281
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
You can be treated differently

282
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Hiking boots

283
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
Should I be here

284
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
So I drove around with Charlie

285
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
For a while

286
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
And

287
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,927
And everywhere I saw signs of threats of natural disaster

288
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
Tsunamis typhoons earthquake

289
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
You showed me the Town Center which is really just a cluster of

290
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Pastel colored buildings

291
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,335
These are all the Old Navy

292
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
And the original US Naval Base which is really where this whole thing got started

293
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,647
So the US Navy showed up in American Samoa in the late 1800s

294
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Samoa

295
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Extremely fractured Germany and the UK were hanging out there too and there were fights among Chiefs decor

296
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
Bought the islands about who owned what turf

297
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
And us may be offered the island of American Samoa protection in exchange for

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Congo Bongo Bay Harper

299
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
Super barber in the South Seas possibly in all the Pacific

300
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Wanted that protects

301
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
American Samoans

302
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
They said that's great. It was a good deal

303
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
One of their High Chiefs his name is Moana

304
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
What's

305
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Basically telling everybody know it

306
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Have the Americans come in

307
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
End in 1900

308
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
They made it official

309
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Some Samoan Chiefs

310
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Signed what they called a deed of session

311
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
The Handover sovereignty

312
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
The United States

313
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,735
And according to Charlie at the time that they did this

314
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
They thought

315
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,647
They had become US citizen of course thanks to the rulings in the insular cases they actually hadn't

316
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
And then

317
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
1929 Congress

318
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
Took up the question of whether American Samoans

319
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Should be US citizens

320
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
And they just said

321
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,935
No and really some of

322
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,543
Vile racist statements being made back their 1929 against it

323
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
We don't want any

324
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Of these

325
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Is Savage racist would never be able to understand

326
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
Our system fast forward 100 years and

327
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,087
Charles is basically trying to overturn Isabel Gonzalez

328
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Case

329
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
His first attempt to do that

330
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
Hi I'm here at

331
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
Was to represent this guy named Lineage 2

332
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,423
Actually got in the rental car and went to visit him while I was on the island

333
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
TV One

334
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,615
A side note there are no addresses in American Samoa

335
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
Great thank you so much I asked sorry I got lost

336
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
Which makes it virtually impossible to find anyone

337
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
But I found them

338
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Funny story

339
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
What is taobao

340
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,463
Green trimmings white hello

341
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
How are you doing

342
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Leonard Scott White hair purple floral shirt on

343
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Taking a drag from a cigarette shooting

344
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Leaning Water Tower

345
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
I'm a retiree

346
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
Taking care of Family Matters here at home

347
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
I am

348
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Not working anymore

349
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,015
Lennon was actually a police officer in American Samoa

350
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,903
He moved to California and live there for a while and he wanted to be a police officer there too

351
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,279
But soon as you came across my my status is that while I'm sorry

352
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
A tall

353
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
You're not a US citizen

354
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
So therefore

355
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
You cannot

356
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Become

357
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
A California Highway Patrol

358
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
They told him he would have to become a citizen first

359
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
Which involve paying hundreds of dollars then

360
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
Taking a test

361
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
I'm not going to do that

362
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
I'm not going to spend a penny I might American

363
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
.

364
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
And that's why Birthright citizenship is so

365
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Important it

366
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,999
Solidified that if you are born on us soil you are equal to everybody else

367
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,631
So in 2012 with the help of Charlie and a lawyer from Guam name Neil Weir

368
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Linen suit the US government

369
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,543
Saying they violated the citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

370
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
That's how I ended up

371
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
In Washington DC

372
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
Bathing the footsteps of the US Supreme Court

373
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,063
Lena says he just wanted the court to give some kind of explanation

374
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
Why American Samoans have been treated

375
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
Why why me why keep us the runaround

376
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
But

377
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
When it got to the supreme court date

378
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Declined tip

379
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Share the case

380
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
2016 they just refuse to make a decision on it

381
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,311
Why are they so afraid to come out just nine of them

382
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
Today Charlie and Neil have another case going with some American Samoans in Utah

383
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
Hopefully this second time around

384
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Supreme Court

385
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Will Prince

386
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Opposition

387
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Or at least

388
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
And so

389
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
At this point of my trip I was curious

390
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
How

391
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Other American Samoans

392
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,119
Even ones who aren't in the states trying to get a job

393
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
How they felt about this case

394
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
In about citizenship

395
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
I assumed that

396
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
They would be behind it because

397
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
Who wants to live in this like

398
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
Foreign but domestic put for in limbo space

399
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:08,319
But public service announcement

400
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
Then I talked to this guy

401
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
His name is Papa out anger

402
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Goes by

403
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Dan

404
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
He's on the radio reading from the American someone Constitution all the time which is kind of weird

405
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,823
Radio reading from the Constitution

406
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Tatoosh allowed

407
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,967
Cool weird

408
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,951
And actually when he heard I was looking into the citizenship question he got a hold of me okay

409
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Okay go ahead

410
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
So you'll be coming West on the main road

411
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,727
So I hopped in my car so I just

412
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Paid the wrong left

413
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
Got a little bit lost again

414
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Little familiarity where they don't need street signs

415
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,391
You'll be alright

416
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
But eventually I did find it.

417
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,560
Where should I park if you want to come in

418
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,144
Yeah yeah yeah let's go as soon as I arrived

419
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
You jumped in my rental car because he wanted to show me what they call faasamoa

420
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Kristoff

421
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,712
It's going around around so we drove down to the center of the village of Leon

422
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,344
One of the larger Villages about 2,000 people and it's on the Southwest coast of the island

423
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,488
Okay great to meet the high Chiefs of the village

424
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
Or magnetized at their known

425
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
I'll come out

426
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,936
Hello

427
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760

Of the Villi

430
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
And

431
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
High talking Chief Maiava

432
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
Got a buzz cut in a white v-neck

00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,072
What's bring you down here to our

434

Ugly Village

435
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
And I asked the Chiefs like

436
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
Would you want to be citizen straight up

437
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752

00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
Would you want to be are you a US citizen

439
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Nope

440
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
Do you want to be

441
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
I want to pee USA

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712

00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528

445
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392

00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Why

447
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Because

448
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
This is the part of America

449
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
So I want a p

450
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
A real American

451
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
It's my kids all live in the states

452
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
I served in the US Military

453
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Thank you so much I really appreciate

454
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Preciate it okay

455
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,504
IGun Dan kind of like Steps in and starts talking to him in Samoan

456
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Permanent

457
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Yahoo

458
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,624
Aqi fighting like

459
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Why

460
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
And I was like what's going on

461
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
And then

462
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
Okay. Now I understand

463
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
End

464
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
I don't want to answer that question

465
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Until I

466
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Prepare myself

467
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
To explain to

468
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
Before you go

469
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
I want to think about it and yeah

470
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Because I wasn't really sure what

471
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Do you think about

472
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
That but then

473
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
Dispel started to ring

474
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
And she might have explained that

475
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,776
They have a curfew in the village of Leon at on Sundays at 6 p.m.

476
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
For 15 minutes

477
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
Everyone has to stop what they're doing and pray

478
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Meditate

479
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Wait that's the law

480
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Yeah I mean

481
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
It's not quite law

482
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,976
But it is the rule in this Village and some others and it is enforced

483
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
And I was talking to the chief Wednesday

484
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
Yam rolls around and the bell rang and I was like oh what happens now and he's like well

485
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
I just drive around and make sure that everybody's following the curfew

486
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
And then he asked me if I wanted to come along with him and I was like

487
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,968
Yeah and he was like bouquet great

488
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
We'll take your car

489
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,880
So we literally got into my car

490
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
And I'm holding the microphone for the chief as we're doing

491
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
The Ride Along

492
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Please tell me where to go

493
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
OK Google

494
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Stop

495
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Wechat

496
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Went up and down

497
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
The Main Street

498
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
It's like

499
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,104
A little over 15 minutes is a very small village

500
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,944
Along the street there are

501
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Young man

502
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
They're called the all manga

503
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
At the Young Men's

504
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Club

505
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
These guys

506
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Just line the streets here

507
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Lined up

508
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
And wearing white shirts and red lava lava

509
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Skirts

510
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
NHS it what do they do they just yellow people

511
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
They just stand there kind of watching

512
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,920
And so there were some people who got caught

513
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
I just have to stop

514
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,088
Sitting there on the side of the road for 15 minutes until it's over

515
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,184
They don't force them to pray but they're just supposed to have quiet time

516
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Set for men

517
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
For 15 minutes

518
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,352
What happens if you don't do that anybody across these laws and everything for the old days

519
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
You're very handsome

520
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Appendages

521
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
Cheap my Ava told me that back in the old days like 1800s

522
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
You would just immediately get kicked out of the village

523
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,736
We don't want to see them no more which means you had no food no protection

524
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Letgo

525
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Death penalty

526
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Those days

527
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
You know but you know nowadays we don't have to do that we would do it like once

528
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,792
When I was talking to you for a puppy oppa he told me that

529
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
These days a pretty common punishment would be like making the person feed the whole village

530
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Should I mean

531
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Picked a lot of food

532
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
50k pekin 50k turkey tail

533
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
50k star

534
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
Wahoo

535
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
+ +

536
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,856
But cheap might have a told me you know if you keep breaking the curfew over and over again

537
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
You can still get kicked out of the village

538
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
Which piscine happened a few times in his life so it's okay

539
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
So so one of the arguments that is made is like this would not pass muster under the US Constitution

540
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Yeah

541
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
But the thing is like

542
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
These guys aren't really the government

543
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
If you look at it one way it's kind of like a gated community or a country club you opt-in to living there

544
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
And you opt into

545
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
You know

546
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
Living under these

547
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Rules

548
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:41,696
But the fear is that if everyone born on the island were automatically granted citizenship

549
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,024
Then a bunch of other us laws might

550
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Start getting applied here to

551
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,680
And they wouldn't be able to do things like these curfews the reason why

552
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,848
Such an existential threat to American Samoans to become US citizen

553
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
Because the 14th Amendment also guarantees equal protection under laws American Samoa

554
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
Become Birthright citizens

555
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,672
It's not long before everyone born on this island is given that equality under the law

556
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
But that word equality

557
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
Historically and even now

558
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
That's such a

559
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
Difficult complicated word to get around

560
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Because

561
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
US citizenship is not something that's

562
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
Applied in a pure

563
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Way

564
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,176
It's saying that historically mixed with a free market

565
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,528
The ideal of equality it actually gets mixed in with other realities

566
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Capitalism and interest

567
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,416
The people in power and the artificial population of lands that were

568
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
People by native peoples

569
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:51,840
And the results have been time and time again that indigenous people have ended up losing their land

570
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,424
Or cultural practice in someone's we have a saying

571
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Original know it is a Monday mandala

572
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Hello Panda

573
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Careful that you are so

574
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Eager for the fish

575
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Did you end up losing your net

576
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
K

577
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Let's be careful of that

578
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
That we

579
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't go after US citizenship

580
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,344
And forget that we have so much to lose

581
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Arnett being our land and our natural resources

582
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
In our culture and our language

583
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
Things that have been lost by so many other native peoples

584
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
Are you a US citizen

585
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Yes

586
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
Manny's people here are you a citizen

587
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
There there

588
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
So are you saying well I'm sure you're saying

589
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:43,296
If you are you a citizen why should everyone else become US citizen

590
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,880
Feel as a US citizen do you feel like you've lost something

591
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
I is it individual haven't lost something

592
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
Because I am part of an extended family

593
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
That lives on family land

594
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
So so

595
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
Could they not live on family lands as US citizens

596
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:07,616
Yes technically speaking here I am a US citizen there many of us who are US citizens

597
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
We could live on family land

598
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
We do live on family

599
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,392
XOXO what I want understand like what is it about granting US citizenship Birthright us

600
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,488
Citizenship to even more

601
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,072
And then he explained to me that

602
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,424
There's a law in American Samoa that says you have to be 50%

603
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Blood

604
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Samoan blood

605
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:39,104
To own land like even if someone person wanted to sell me or like

606
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Give me their land

607
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
They couldn't by law

608
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
So

609
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
Someone from some country

610
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Say

611
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
Main everyone picks on China these days so maybe

612
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Someone from China music

613
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
And a

614
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
The laws changed and it

615
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
The law says anyone born here is a US citic

616
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Okay

617
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
So this person here

618
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
I'm trying to let you know

619
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,616
Build a business becomes a wealthy businessman

620
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
From China

621
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
And one day he wants to buy land

622
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Endnote

623
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,064
Lord say well no we can't sell you these lands

624
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,160
Everybody says no I want to buy that land and I have the right to buy that

625
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Okay

626
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
That's what I'm talking

627
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
About that's the threat

628
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,680
Finally he was like think about it like if everyone born here is a Birthright Citizen and everyone has equal rights

629
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
Here it's not long before a Chinese person is born here

630
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,616
The US citizen they have equal rights to the land as someone's to

631
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
And then things

632
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
They could sue to make that

633
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,248
Blood Simon law illegal

634
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
So

635
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,856
Maybe not in one generation but in a couple Generations

636
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
Blood someone with loser land

637
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
That's a threat

638
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,024
I guess you have to imagine what would Hawaii be like

639
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,096
If they didn't lose all their lands the way that they had

640
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,424
Siwik to us Hawaii is what we never want to become

641
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,032
You know you land at the airport in Hawaii who do you see where are the Hawaiians

642
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,336
You know for us to look at Hawaii

643
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
You still look at a sad story

644
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
You know

645
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
So

646
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,368
But everything I say you have to also remember we're loyal and patriotic people

647
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
It's worth pointing out that

648
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:35,072
American Samoa has one of the highest rates of military enlistment of any US state or territory

649
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
They say the Pledge of Allegiance at school in the morning they learn US History learn about the US Constitution

650
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
But this is still our home

651
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Right now we still have to protect

652
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
Do you think what's Happening Here

653
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
The land

654
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,504
The curfews the sort of thing do you think it's unconstitutional

655
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
I can give you the literature that says it's

656
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
A repugnant

657
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
To the US Constitution

658
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,512
So you do think you do think it's uncommon

659
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
You think it's on Cox

660
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
Why people stay on Earth

661
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm not saying it's unconstitutional

662
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
But

663
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,288
We do understand that there is a view that it is considered

664
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Racist and I'm constant

665
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
But it's also

666
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
It gives us a chance

667
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
To survive

668
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
Coming up

669
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
That balancing act that he's doing this with weighing

670
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Of things which

671
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
I'm pretty

672
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
You're not cancer

673
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
What's going to get a lot more personal

674
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
The break

675
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
Hi this is Megan and I'm calling from a cloudy Ithaca New York

676
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,024
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

677
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,608
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

678
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
More information about Sloan

679
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,472
At www.scoan.org

680
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
Hey I'm chantaboon rice radio glorious story about love the question before

681
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,576
For us is should people born in American Samoa

682
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,464
The automatically be citizens of the United States of America that's the question just because they're born.

683
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Exactly and

684
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,584
For the break we heard about some land ownership laws

685
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
Zetor

686
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,472
Constitutionally questionable

687
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,776
Yeah and the more people I talk to

688
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
The more Tangled

689
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
The reality of blood

690
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
Laws for land ownership.

691
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
Hey how's it going

692
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
All right because

693
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
You kind of run out of people to marry

694
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
It's okay first just like your name

695
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Genevieve

696
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,304
59 Greg I talk to this one woman Genevieve Greg who runs

697
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
For company there and how long have you lived here

698
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
My whole life

699
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
Except for 7 years I live in California

700
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
And what are the first things you told me was

701
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,384
I have a feeling to end like this island so small

702
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Corey Wright

703
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:37,600
So basically there has to be intermarriage

704
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
The running joke here is like when a sound when I get to invitations

705
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,328
For the same wedding that we know we go

706
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Add to family member

707
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Play this is like

708
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
That show Cash Cab confess

709
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
Now

710
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
Genevieve herself 25%

711
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Yes

712
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
Her mom is half Samoan and my dad is Canadian

713
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
When I was younger

714
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
I never knew I was white

715
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
Nobody's I never knew I was wait till I went to California After High School does she like realize she was white one time

716
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:30,848
I'm at a bar in California when someone was like nevermind

717
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,664
Whatever that means let's go

718
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Itsfunneh at one point

719
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
We pick up her friend

720
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
How do you look like crap

721
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:49,536
Okay so this is Julia whose name is too many snow goes by money

722
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Tell her the white girl

723
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
Money is actually way darker skin than Genevieve but she grew up in California and talks like she

724
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,104
She's from the state

725
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
Thank you very much

726
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Lights

727
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
You're The Darkest Hour volume

728
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,280
Darkest Polansky Samoan word for white person

729
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
Waiting I'm a little confused what's

730
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,400
Who's whose who know the point is

731
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
My ear is 100% blood Samoan

732
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,336
But she's not that culturally xiamen she doesn't speak the language very well she's

733
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
Only spent a few years there

734
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,784
Whereas Genevieve is very culturally someone has spent most of her life there speaks perfect someone but

735
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,184
Because she and her sisters are only 25% Samoan blood because we're not 50% she can't

736
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Technically own land in American Samoa

737
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
Her mom recently passed away and try to block we planned to her and her sisters even if it was written in

738
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
Well that it was us

739
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
Inherited we inherited it

740
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
We can't get it because we're not 50% and this blood loss effects money

741
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Because of her son

742
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,064
Samuel Pucci brought along in the car

743
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
Maya took away video game and he

744
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Freaked out

745
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
What's going on

746
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Yes my son

747
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
Drama

748
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,080
Anyway it affects her son because his dad

749
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:43,456
Is American without one drop of someone's blood

750
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
Sol Samuels kids

751
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:53,184
Will only be able to own land if he has them with a half or full blood sample

752
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
Your testimony kids you can marry white girl

753
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,640
Mom I got my glasses

754
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
It's tea time

755
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
That's okay

756
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
And then another name that came up

757
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Is that

758
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
Genevieve interestingly is

759
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
She loves you

760
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,256
And she has a partner who she wants to marry

761
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,096
My first

762
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
Are you planning on a second I don't know we'll see how good she is but seems like

763
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
Marriage is not legal in American Samoa

764
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
We couldn't be

765
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,432
Public affectionate with each other or

766
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
Be a couple my mom still was like whatever you do need to do it inside the bedroom like we couldn't even be in

767
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,648
House in like give each other a hug or something

768
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,232
Doesn't that we went through a couple years of really

769
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Rocky

770
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
Relationship

771
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
And then

772
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
So here you got

773
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,056
Genevieve and my two people who the Constitution applied here the way it does in the states

774
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
It seems like

775
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
Their problems will be solved

776
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,992
Genevieve would get her land and my son could have kids with whoever he wants to

777
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,832
And maybe Genevieve down the road could marry whoever she wants to

778
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
Do you wish you could

779
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
Get married here

780
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
Yes or no I mean

781
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,632
I don't have the same views as other gay people like

782
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
I'm a Republican and

783
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,312
People always ask me how can you be gay in a Republican and a female right

784
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
I have certain views like I'd rather have Financial stability at the end of the day then be able to get married to someone you know I draw

785
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
Try to be rich and with someone then

786
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Poor and Mary

787
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,368
Because in the end we're going to divorce either way right

788
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,488
First time in American Samoa and I don't know like

789
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
I don't know anything what do I know

790
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
But but

791
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
But I'm like trying to think about like

792
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:15,264
Growing up on Michael being a US citizen like matters and it's like it comes with all these rights

793
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of

794
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,664
Equality under the law and stuff like that

795
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,528
Are yours we have them with high system so

796
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
All that stuff is

797
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Does it matter

798
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Where is freedom of speech until they say

799
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
I'm speaking

800
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Yunnan

801
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Go get coffee

802
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:43,168
She for everybody so that yeah that doesn't take place.

803
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Now

804
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,056
Even though Birthright citizenship wouldn't necessarily change all that

805
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,919
I still expected them to what Birthright citizenship for American Samoans

806
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
But

807
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
They both told me

808
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
No

809
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,831
Are you a US citizen are you

810
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
Yay

811
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:11,327
We have learned that an American can I get what if

812
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,423
Reserved

813
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Fundamental rights

814
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
Would be enforced

815
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Stigmatizing

816
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Couldn't deny you those

817
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Who wouldn't

818
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,455
People could sue in federal court

819
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
And enforce

820
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Yeah

821
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
He was problem

822
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,463
RR Spike

823
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
The Grinch

824
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Care about that

825
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
Before my move gear sheep

826
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
Was living in California

827
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:52,543
She married an American bought a house

828
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Raining in in the states

829
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Nothing here

830
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
Nothing

831
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
What changed

832
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
What changed

833
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
Like Nu like did you notice something change in you

834
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Oh yeah

835
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,647
I love this I would never move back to

836
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
Here

837
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
I get to spend more time with my kids

838
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
I think that

839
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,935
And we we get to spend more time as a family

840
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
You don't own our own are our own business we would never be able to do that in the states

841
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,919
You don't people who buy a house in the states I called Man U

842
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,271
You know you made it whatever you bought a house your homeowner

843
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
I'm like no way that

844
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
We've learned that fax that was such

845
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Bulshit

846
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
We don't use credit anymore we don't use none of that f****** s*** that they have out there we don't we don't

847
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
We are not in debt

848
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
We are

849
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
Text but what we have

850
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Here

851
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
We're happy

852
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
I was so blinded

853
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
Life truly should

854
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Is Rip life

855
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
We live like everyday

856
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
I love it

857
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
I love it

858
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
A lot of that isn't it a lot of that like

859
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,511
The fact that you do have land like you own land

860
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Yep

861
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Off of it

862
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
But at the same time

863
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,679
They did both agree that these land ownership laws about blood are

864
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Kind of messed up

865
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,079
And Charlie a lalima the lawyer on that citizenship case we mentioned

866
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,407
That's what he thinks to

867
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
He's actually asked him to

868
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
Help try to get her mom's land

869
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,319
That's this whole citizenship case again

870
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
It somehow you were special down here

871
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,487
That you're entitled and able to do a lot of these things that are Peyton Lee

872
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,119
And even worse in my mind is

873
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,727
Actually does want to preserve someone ownership of lands

874
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,823
But just to do it in some other way because he thinks the blood rules are just

875
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,663
Illegal and other basically a kind of Jim Crow law

876
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,479
So there was a case actually two two years ago

877
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
And I try to explain to Monty and Genevieve

878
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:16,159
That you could see the fight for citizenship as a fight against the insular cases

879
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
In which

880
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,767
The Supreme Court Justices called territories like American Samoa

881
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,839
Quote possessions inhabited by alien races

882
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
And said they were unfit for Anglo-Saxon legal Traditions he thought it was very racist and he wanted that the US gov

883
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
Yeah it's it's it's it's explained

884
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
Like work.

885
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Because

886
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,991
Is he feels like someone's are in a limbo a little bit

887
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Legally

888
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
Well let's go back to the 1904 figure out what the

889
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,303
Move on with your life right now

890
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
And honestly

891
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
Leaving the car with those two

892
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,359
It did make me wonder

893
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,455
How common is their perspective on the island

894
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
So my name is Juliet

895
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,623
I spent a bunch of time wandering around for the next couple days

896
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,975
Taking a very informal poll

897
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,791
Ask you a couple questions that okay

898
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
If it were put to a vote

899
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Would you make

900
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,935
American Samoans automatic citizen

901
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Becoming a US citizen

902
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,847
At first it seemed like it was just a lot of

903
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
No because I

904
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
Always got to be mindful of what happened to blonde when he States took over Guam we're truly blessed in the sense that we were

905
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:54,463
Keep a culture or land this one someone veteran

906
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,095
With a make America great again baseball cap

907
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
I don't I don't want to be a US citizen to be US national

908
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
I don't want to

909
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
A Japanese or Chinese

910
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
And I'm up

911
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
The same thing

912
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Us

913
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
You know I rather be a some more you know

914
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
What did you order here

915
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:22,111
Fish fillet and then interesting lie at McDonald's

916
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
What do you think of that idea

917
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,743
I think that's a great idea idea because that's going to be out

918
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Fair I got only

919
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,607
Yes be great because

920
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,191
Gay marriage when buffini is there called what

921
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
Men At Birth but end up

922
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,823
Dressing like women here we do have partners

923
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,455
They do live with them but you are kind of accepted in society but they're just not allowed to marry who they want to marry

924
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
It's not recognized by law

925
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
So

926
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
But that's totally okay in the US

927
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,927
And in particular when I talk to immigrants

928
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,767
From Korea China the Philippines Tonga

929
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,095
Most of them wanted citizenship

930
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
In the city

931
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
Automatically granted

932
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,727
Of course why not

933
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
I wish I wish I wish

934
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
Maybe God help me

935
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
For the non American Nationals

936
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,943
That you don't pay property Hawaii that be great if

937
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Iffy

938
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
If they become citizen

939
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,087
This is something else that Charlie Auto Lima brought up with me

940
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
I guess

941
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
Do you have kind of started to talk about

942
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
Injustice has

943
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
Cheer that are kind of

944
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Swept under the rug without

945
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Citizenship

946
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,119
I think mostly it is how immigration will be handled

947
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
American Samoa you told me

948
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,983
You have immigrants coming to the island for work

949
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,079
And because American Samoa controls its own borders

950
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
And because

951
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,735
He says there's locks enforcement of immigration laws some people talked about corruption

952
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,087
You have situations where immigrants end up here on questionable visas

953
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,927
Stripped of their rights to wages and fair working conditions

954
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
And in some cases

955
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
It hasn't been very

956
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
Good you know

957
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
What some of the foreigners

958
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
It's a lot of abuse

959
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
But if you do become a citizen then and if

960
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
US immigration

961
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
Service comes on actually

962
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Just the laws

963
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
Requirements

964
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Farmers coming

965
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
Work here

966
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Daniel

967
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
Probably see

968
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Change

969
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,879
I am serious as you were doing these interviews how are you processing all this

970
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Kind of

971
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:37,023
Making my way across the island and there were some people

972
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
From this was a really

973
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:45,215
Personal thing other people had these high ideals of Rights of others no high ideals of Samoan culture

974
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,543
But I did meet one person who

975
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
Kind of held all of these

976
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Ideas

977
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
In her mind that once

978
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:59,295
Thank you and her name is

979
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Tisa

980
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
IMovie

981
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,439
Hello I'm the infamous she's the woman from the famous

982
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
Barefoot bar in the South Pacific

983
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
She run

984
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
Tisa's Barefoot bar

985
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,959
It's a series of Follies or grass roof wooden structures on stilts

986
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
Thank you

987
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:27,967
Pretty magical and they are right on the water of this beach

988
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,783
I like a beach which is a Marine reserve

989
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,367
And actually stayed in one of the following overnight

990
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
And you

991
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,695
Step out onto the sand in the morning

992
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
And every shell

993
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Moved

994
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
It was

995
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Bursting with life

996
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
As for the pictures pin

997
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Yeah the pictures

998
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,191
Raise a credible

999
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
Then what's the time here

1000
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
Picture of a little bit I've been wrong

1001
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:59,967
Just about many trails to see how far I get

1002
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
Hahahahaha

1003
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,087
What where has the grab the trails of like taking you

1004
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,623
Taking me to

1005
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
Foreign line in on the West Coast

1006
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,767
She has flags from different countries and states hanging up in her bar

1007
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:19,423
And she has a unique perspective on American Samoa I don't know why I just am so disappointed that the

1008
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,215
That we ended up this way

1009
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,519
Was very content with what little we get

1010
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,895
And there's no waves bandana by the people don't know what their rights are people don't know they don't speak up

1011
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
I appreciate these guys speaking up about the citizenship

1012
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:37,855
Because at least that's a bold move showing that maybe somebody's thinking I have tendency to think

1013
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,671
As you can hear in my voice my thumb

1014
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:47,071
Lisa told me she went to the US Mainland for the first time when she was 16 years old

1015
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,863
Looking for anything better I was just

1016
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,727
Curious about what the other boy the world really looks like coming from this tiny lower.

1017
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,823
So she went to live with her aunt in San Diego to go to high school there

1018
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
Noise 60 I ended up following the Black Panthers the Black Panther

1019
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
Had arrived in San Diego by that time I was curious

1020
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:14,207
Say okay what are these people cuz all I hear is bad stuff

1021
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
Solution I want to be the meetings of them

1022
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:23,167
Newspapers were passed out posters post where the black people were gathering and we plan to keep the faith

1023
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,055
The necessary to to liberate himself improve their lives

1024
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,407
And they were actually citydog encouraging all the kids

1025
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:39,039
Black kids blue kids whatever color kids to go including someone's like me

1026
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
You go to college and I did and she said she also sat in on meeting

1027
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:50,303
Things in the women's movement

1028
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
Still have a job to have respect not be viewed as a piece of meat my whole purpose of hanging around whenever these big

1029
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,263
Rally's and I listen I watch

1030
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
Just learn and

1031
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Make a note

1032
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,431
Learn and make a note and sitting there in the back of those meetings

1033
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:12,063
Inevitably I keep thinking about how she begins to think

1034
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,671
Men control their wives their children their daughters have no right to speak up

1035
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
The way things work at home

1036
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Just isn't

1037
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,071
Just so much Injustice year for women

1038
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
The fact that women were not cheap

1039
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Women were abused

1040
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,191
And young girls

1041
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:33,823
Domestic abuse out of frustrations and this is why I love someone and they never want to come back here

1042
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,663
But Lisa and her 20s decided she would come back

1043
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,759
Yeah I never felt that California was my home I was just a student of California

1044
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
And I learned a lot

1045
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,439
I learned a lot about my rights as a woman and I'll earn my right to speak up

1046
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,999
And she brought those lessons back home

1047
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
When I came back I was

1048
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
Very vocal

1049
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,119
I spoke out I never back up

1050
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
From any man

1051
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,591
And so when my when I ran for governor so she ran for office we have our campaigning for political

1052
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Office

1053
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,175
The song One Way you don't speak out against anybody

1054
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
As we still don't

1055
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
But I went against all that

1056
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,575
Am I spoke up I spoke about rights

1057
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
You have these rights that you can

1058
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,903
Advocate for

1059
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,487
But no one would do it because people were free and the Chiefs

1060
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
My Dad's cousin

1061
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,375
That he was a governor and he brought all the planning a big Who's Who the big

1062
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
Cheap the big boys

1063
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
They came to Dad

1064
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
An acid

1065
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,335
Ask him if you will please tell your daughter not to run for governor

1066
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Because that

1067
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
That's what cheese do

1068
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
And my father told me

1069
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Well she's so own person

1070
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:50,111
She's going to do whatever she wants and she can do that she has those right

1071
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
And I'm not going to tell her no

1072
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,255
I love them forever for that but he didn't like me because I was

1073
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,559
Because I was not the daughter

1074
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,631
That I was supposed to be I was very vocal

1075
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,703
Tara Strong voices I hear me

1076
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Did you win

1077
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,079
Oh no I just serious I would never win

1078
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
But I was very vocal

1079
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:17,759
I was just out there I did not care I wanted because I learned from America you have the right to speak

1080
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,551
And that was very big for me

1081
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,367
And so she believe she's like the one reason why I am

1082
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
Proud to be an American

1083
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Is that

1084
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
We have rights

1085
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Does

1086
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,047
Some part of the Constitution protect our rights

1087
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:35,679
So again here we have a person who you think would absolutely support

1088
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,263
Charlie's fight to get American Samoans US citizenship

1089
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
But

1090
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
No

1091
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,151
I hope not it's not a good idea

1092
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
Yeah I know today is still the wrong thing to address

1093
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
She said it's not worth it

1094
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Wow

1095
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,951
No way it's not worth it because

1096
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
For when she thinks

1097
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,791
You know American Samoans are already

1098
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
Running off to the US

1099
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,983
To bind like what they think is going to be a better life and US citizenship would probably make that drain

1100
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Rain on the island even worse

1101
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
And then

1102
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,663
For life on the island culture I need to protect

1103
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,503
And it always my need to be a US citizen

1104
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
It's not about me at all it's about my island is about my people it's about my family's about my Village

1105
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:33,279
It's about this wonderful community so I will never go up and try to

1106
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,375
Change anything if they're not with me I've learned that the hard way

1107
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,703
I've learned that and I'm humbled by it

1108
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Because

1109
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
Well communal system out your system

1110
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
It's a very system that's keeping us alive and together I guess I'm wondering like what what about the communal system do you

1111
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,991
You think would would definitely go away

1112
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:04,767
No like what what is it about the communal system like that is completely incompatible with being a citizen

1113
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,447
The Western ways is individualism it's about individuals rights mine my real estate mile

1114
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,031
But for us it's about protecting all of us

1115
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
I'll communal rights

1116
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
So is complete opposite

1117
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
Of the American system

1118
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:26,527
If you bring in a whole bunch of immigrants is going to disrupt that Village it's already doing that

1119
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
Why

1120
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:33,183
People who move in and cite their rights I have the right I have my

1121
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Freedom to do this

1122
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
That's not what it's about

1123
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:43,167
In the evening we have a bell for everybody to enter their home and do the meditation to these people come in and look at us

1124
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:49,567
Everything foreign us last already with us but but I mean like the people

1125
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
People who are coming

1126
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
I like they're already popping right and they're already having kids here we're becoming Nationals right like maybe that ship has

1127
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
Yeah but if the land was still preserved

1128
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:15,423
It's a joke I've seen all the land has been reserved the government turned them over and sell and make profit

1129
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
Improve it

1130
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,407
All right

1131
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Wow

1132
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,575
She spent time with the Black Panthers ran for office

1133
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,391
Still feels somehow

1134
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
The

1135
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,743
Existential threat to the Island's culture

1136
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,535
Overrules those

1137
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
Those rights

1138
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
I don't know it

1139
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,911
I mean it's the calculation in her head

1140
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
But

1141
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,031
I remember sitting there on the beach NJ

1142
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,847
Not being able to wrap my head around it

1143
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,159
I spent two Sundays in American Samoa

1144
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,951
I went to church services

1145
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,815
Not everybody goes to church but the island is about 98% Christian

1146
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,351
Many people

1147
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Hold me

1148
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,167
The center of faasamoa

1149
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,983
I'm sitting in those pews

1150
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,543
Watching people of all ages

1151
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:28,383
Sing and interact with each other they all know each other

1152
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
Looking out for each other

1153
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
Is a feeling of

1154
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,759
Belonging

1155
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,087
Citizenship

1156
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Is about belonging

1157
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,743
Belonging to the US tends to come with its own set of

1158
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Right

1159
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
And responsibilities

1160
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
End

1161
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
It struck me that

1162
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,239
The set of ideals which I hold so dear so many of us hold so dear

1163
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
That people here

1164
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
Would see them as a threat

1165
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
2

1166
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
To their survival

1167
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,695
So I went back to Charlie Ally Lima

1168
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
So I would actually talk to Dad

1169
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,535
Fandango

1170
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Yeah so he

1171
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
Ikea

1172
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Do you want to fight

1173
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:27,775
I told him what Pisa had told me and then I got told me

1174
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,615
Basically like Hawaii is a cautionary tale like

1175
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687
Why is it considered retail

1176
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
It's interesting because

1177
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,599
What do you mean saying is I don't trust America

1178
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,159
That's that's what that means

1179
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
And he told me

1180
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,279
He doesn't think that this community would

1181
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,071
Necessarily have to change

1182
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
Cautionary Tale

1183
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,143
History that happened

1184
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
Hundred year hundred and ten years ago

1185
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,007
Okay that was a hundred and ten years ago America

1186
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
I would like that

1187
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
Have they change

1188
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,015
Jim Crow around any more of the ideas you know

1189
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
You know

1190
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:17,439
The real question is do you trust the US government

1191
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
To do the right thing

1192
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Custer Federal

1193
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
To do the right thing

1194
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,399
I personally believe that

1195
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:32,543
If you don't trust the government get out of that government

1196
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:37,151
He was like so we Samoans need to make a decision about Who We Are

1197
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,711
If we want to be part of the us or not

1198
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:46,367
There shouldn't be this in between

1199
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,951
Constitution is a document that

1200
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:56,351
Something that we should all aspire to we may not reach that but we always

1201
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,239
That's why we still believe in it and I still have faith in you can go to the courts and

1202
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,055
Get any problems rectified but

1203
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
I lose that face and I'm just

1204
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,247
Do you think what would make you lose stuff

1205
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:51,903
