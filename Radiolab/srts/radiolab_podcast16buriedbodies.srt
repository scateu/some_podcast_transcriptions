00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616

00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344

00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
A legal case

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
Well it's actually

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
It's it's really more than just illegal

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Suitcase

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
It's it's

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,840
What my husband and I referred to as a mental magnet

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,680
Once you start thinking about it it won't go away

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
It gets under your skin this is Lisa Lerman I'm a law professor at Catholic University

14
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
Epi Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna Farrell

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Who brought us the story

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
And under whose skin

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
It also seems

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
It just made me

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
Not know whether to side with my head or my heart

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
And up

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
Take me to jump in and say this episode contains

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
Some violence and explicit imagery in it

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
If you're listening with kids

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
You

26
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
Just know that going in and you might want to skip this one

27
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
So to get the story started

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Shirking Tracy my name is Jim Tracy and I'm going to Ward winning journalist

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Glens Falls been reporting on this story since about 2,000 he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think there is

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,024
Isn't he he's been so focused on it is that

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
It's pretty close to home for him

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks is where the Story begins

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,496
So Saturday night July 28th 1973

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,336
For young people

35
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Go camping in the Adirondacks

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,968
Pulled off the road beside Road off Route 30

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
They made up a makeshift campsite

38
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
Grass clearing they set up two times and went to sleep for the night

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,696
And on Sunday that you know I woke up

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
And

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
About 9 a.m. campers

42
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Hurt somebody walking outside their

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Their time

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
And I'll suddenly heard the zipper

45
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,264
And the time go up and what they saw was as middle-aged man. Into the tent

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Look like a conservation officer he had a fedora with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle he had a buck knife

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Binoculars around his neck

48
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
And very calmly he told them

49
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
Almost politely to step out of their time which they did the other two campers

50
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
You're all four of them rounded up together

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
And they're kind of standing in a semicircle

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,840
And then the man cock the gun and said listen to I've killed before and I'll kill again

53
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,936
I'm going to take your gas by don't want to get caught so I'm going to tell you the trees

54
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
They started marching the kids off into the woods

55
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,592
Took him into the woods near a brook in pairs a 2 with him behind them

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
The kids of course were scared out of their wits by themselves

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
You nosey pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,160
So after we had the four people tied

59
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
He went back to

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,072
The first boy 18 year old fell down blue ski and the forest

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
They couldn't really see what was happening because you're clearly

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
And I'm

63
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
They heard vomiting sounds when they heard Phillips voice get really high and

64
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
They knew something was happening something bad was happening to him what was happening with his buck knife

65
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Stop in 5 times in the chest and when this happened three of them and their Panic were able to break

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Loose and start running Nick fiorello ran to his car Carol and malinowski ran through the woods

67
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
But the man caught one of them

68
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite

69
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,544
And he had them lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Supreme Inn in

71
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
The killer laying in the ditch an hour

72
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
The man command at the other two campers the ones we gotten away had managed to alert

73
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
All sudden they spotted them killer

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
And Freeman

75
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the man screaming for help saying he

76
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
He's got a gun he's going to shoot

77
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
And a man with a gun

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
Just kind of stood up

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
Calmly and coolly walked into the forest

80
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
And thus began

81
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
What was at the time the largest man on State history state police cars parked almost

82
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Does far up the road as you can see when the Manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the State Police standing by

83
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
It was a scene like a never been seen before up there

84
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Roving patrols man armed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
Helicopters game right now like Monday or Tuesday they had 200 men on the case

86
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
Out of the Woods eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID

87
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
837 year old Robert Garrow Robert Francis Garrow Sr of Syracuse New York

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
Looking forward today he was an ex-convict in prison for rape of 7 years

89
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
Alpine with a 30-30 rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC

90
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
So by Tuesday people got panicked

91
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
People loaded the rifles they block the doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here

92
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
People left the area so fast

93
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
They left behind coolers on what happened with Carol was able to use those camps and

94
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,583
That food in those drinks to survive about 400 men now

95
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
The police

96
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
Follow a lead that he had stolen the car and he had been sighted and they

97
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
They're kind of closing in on him

98
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
And then the 12th Thursday August 9th 1973

99
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,759
Very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer officer named Hillary LeBlanc

100
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Sparta Gyro

101
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
He said freeze or drop your gun something to that effect

102
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
And Carol started running

103
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
LeBlanc fire four times

104
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Got him in the back

105
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
The arm in the foot

106
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
Darrell went down once got back up and kept running chasing through the forest

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
Distant very short time they saw Daryl and he was laying down in the mud

108
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Cuz he was just laying there

109
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,247
But that you know I took his pulse and everything and he was certainly alive

110
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
Put him in an ambulance and they rushed him to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and According to Jim a couple of

111
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Cops go with him

112
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
They're going in the whole time because they think that you might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's Gone Missing

113
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
But he wouldn't talk

114
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
At this point

115
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
Did the story that I'm interested in really get started

116
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,175
It's known as the buried bodies case and I think one of the things

117
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
So fascinating about the

118
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,551
Case this is my professor Lisa Lerman use the conflict

119
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
Between what a good lawyer should do

120
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
And what a good person should do

121
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
In the situation

122
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:34,911
Required to the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani

123
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
Frankie charmany

124
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
The lawyer in Syracuse

125
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
I never know whether to pronounce it

126
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Arman AR

127
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Terminator

128
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
That's Mary Armani

129
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
Frank's wife

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Harmony

131
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
But it is

132
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Armani

133
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Couple months ago pretty sure Simon Adler and I went up to visit them

134
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
They live right outside of Syracuse New York

135
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Mister Money is now in his 80s he's retired

136
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
My name is Frank

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Armani

138
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
And I was the attorney for Robert Carroll

139
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
Where do I buy I love to have you start wherever you like how did this whole

140
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Story start for you

141
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Give a bit of background

142
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Mitt Romney told me that when he was a kid

143
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
You got picked on for a couple different reasons and he said he was always a guy that it wouldn't walk away

144
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Lightfoot

145
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Fights

146
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Physical fights

147
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney

148
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Search for a Defender

149
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
You're fighting to stay

150
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,775
And Taryn and he's doing really well he's well-respected had a good reputation

151
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
But

152
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Thanima Robert Caro

153
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Black hair strong man

154
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
To take him out

155
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Need a 45

156
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
And I just had that feeling that this guy

157
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Is dangerous

158
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
And a lot of things are going to happen

159
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
This is a year before the Manhunt

160
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
1972 Frank remembers he represented in

161
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
At first onto pretty small things

162
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
A school teacher has a salted his child he was under the suit of school and I

163
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
I talked him out of it

164
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,943
And then he had an automobile accident I represented my back

165
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
But then

166
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Pretty quickly

167
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
Dark Gyarados charged with trying to kidnap two college kids

168
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
That case got dismissed but then

169
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
Melissa see some young girl kids very young girls age 10 and 11 Guerra was released on bail

170
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
He skipped his court date

171
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
And just disappeared

172
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
And then we pick up where we left off

173
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
The murder The Manhunt

174
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
An August 9th

175
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The night girl got captured

176
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Frank gets a call

177
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
From girls wife

178
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Telling me that you wanted to talk to me Armani to represent my impression is that Armani

179
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,415
Didn't want to do it in my mind I'm saying what the hell do I want to get involved in this

180
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,815
Go for it never handled a murder charge from murder case you didn't know

181
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
How the problem was Gary wouldn't talk

182
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,983
Any lawyer except for Armani attorney

183
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,335
Eventually decides to go and talk to the judge you've been assigned to the case

184
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
And the judges basically like

185
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,967
We have an obligation to provide the council

186
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
That this guy wants

187
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
So I mean unless you have a good reason why you can't do it

188
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
I want to appoint you his public defender

189
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Anna Ronnie agrees

190
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
And so at that point

191
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
He has to defend Carol

192
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Yeah

193
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
So this is reporter Jim Tracy again

194
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,543
Together as friends or families picnic together to help them with this case

195
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
As co-counsel because I felt I needed support LG was the top criminal defense lawyers

196
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
In central New York I need someone with brains and guts

197
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
So our money goes to talk to belge

198
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
I just need backup that's it has no money in it

199
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
The prosecution had three eyeball Witnesses they had his car at the scene of the crime and they had his two-week flight he was

200
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
Guilty and I said come on I'm not going to try to prove you didn't do it send

201
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Maybe girl murdered this kid maybe it was because he had temporarily gone insane

202
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
I'm telling you about my Siri and have that Armani tells him

203
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,303
We pulled this off a while but eventually

204
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
I'm in

205
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Frank

206
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
Now we're into late August 1973

207
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
I got there they want a big girls room on the fifth floor of the hospital

208
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
Police are standing guard

209
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
They walked into the room

210
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
I haven't seen them in a while

211
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
We greeted each other and we talked

212
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
And just a picture this

213
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Jim told me that the room they put garro in was what he described as a training observation room which meant that it had

214
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
Does big window that ran alongside girls bed

215
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
So they could keep an eye on it and the cops are stationed right outside

216
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Just

217
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Watching

218
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
And According to Jim and I should save her different accounts about this but apparently the cops had brought in a lip read

219
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:36,735
To try to see what year was saying I don't think you can do that

220
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
That's not legal I think that's

221
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Probably not okay but from the cops perspective they think that he's involved in recent merch

222
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
Murder and missing girl

223
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
And they think that girl could still be alive

224
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
So they want to know

225
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer

226
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
2 solving that murder and finding that girl

227
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
But at the same time the defendant has to be able to share absolutely everything with the lawyers and know that there

228
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,455
In that safe space of that relationship because we have

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right

230
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
Not to incriminate oneself

231
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Free meet speakers attorney

232
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,023
Then we have no real Justice sister Army and LG

233
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,655
They need as much information about what Gareth has done as they possibly can get so they can start to build

234
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Their defense

235
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
I don't like surprises

236
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
I'm the kind that wants to know everything

237
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,871
Wow so so what that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here

238
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
He needed to get from Garrow his story and it needed to be just that me didn't want the cops in on it yet

239
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:48,927
Don't know if there is TAPS in the room or what so they're turn up the TV turn up the fans but

240
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
He was playing games so he talked basically about anything but

241
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
But the cases

242
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,655
Kept saying he couldn't remember you couldn't remember and they're they're trying to convince him like

243
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,543
You got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot Lynch Mob out there

244
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
There's Witnesses in Cairo new

245
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:12,991
He could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe 25 to life and pedophile in prison

246
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
Careful things and get rough

247
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
But they tell him if you talk to us

248
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
Maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity

249
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Only defense to help get Garrow into a mental hospital instead of a prison that was the Galt

250
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
If you have anything to say

251
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
Took several conversations to get Garrett at this point

252
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
But finally

253
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Portosol out

254
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
At this point it was just belge in the room

255
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
And I told him

256
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
Yes he had killed them booski

257
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
And it also killed other people too and the episodes

258
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
When Garrow kills people seem to have

259
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
I followed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,887
And you know become psychotic and do horrible things

261
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
When it came to the details keep tended to not remember but then

262
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,567
Girl mentions two particular girls who were then missing

263
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
And his parents had no idea where they were twenty-one-year-old Susan pads and another girl 16 year old Alicia Hawk

264
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Susan pets

265
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
Bus from Chicago she's a girl I mentioned earlier cops were already looking for her hoping that girl might have some information

266
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Earlier that summer

267
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:33,119
Her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them have been camping and Susan have been gone ever since

268
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Alicia Hauck

269
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
She's a high school girl from Syracuse

270
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
She gone missing just a couple of days before Susan

271
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Everybody thought

272
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
She might have just run away

273
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
But Garrett told the lawyers

274
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
That he had killed them and where he had left their body

275
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
One odd thing about the arrows

276
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
Description of the incidence

277
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
He doesn't say I killed her

278
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
He says

279
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
She got stabbed with my knife

280
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
She got stabbed with my knife

281
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
Like it wasn't even him doing the stabbing right

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Like this is

283
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
What do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself

284
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Is this

285
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,407
True you know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be

286
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,295
A dream he had it could be a delusion if you're going to go and

287
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
You know craft an argument and in

288
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
Preventive strategy you need to know

289
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
What actually happened

290
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Don't you walk out the door

291
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
He grabs Frank and he says let's go

292
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
So they they sleep outside

293
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
I get in the car

294
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
And

295
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
We take off to go look for the bodies

296
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
Caro told lawyers that Susan pets was in an air vent of a

297
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Close-up Mineshaft

298
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
The mine is up in Mineville an hour south of the hospital

299
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Are you scared are you excited like

300
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
You scared you're concerned yet fear you're a fool if you don't

301
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,495
In the rearview mirror they got a little spooked State Police

302
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
So eventually they pull over get out of the car

303
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
In

304
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,943
Went into one bar where one of Francis belge

305
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Lady friends

306
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
What's hanging out

307
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
We're about 30 minutes build you talk to her then asked if he could borrow her car

308
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Door

309
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Took off driving the lady friends cartoon

310
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,727
Until they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get

311
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
Here as far as we're going to go

312
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Okay we can walk

313
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Up to this old abandoned mine

314
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
Went out there last February with reporter Laura mckinstry and

315
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
The town supervisor of Mariah TomSka the father

316
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
So this is a road that goes to the mines or what is

317
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,911
It was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road

318
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Jamberry I see that day

319
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
This hair

320
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
This used to be in Allroad 1

321
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
We're walking up a very wooded

322
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Hill

323
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Fairly steep ever no leaves

324
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
And all the trees were

325
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,159
Black and Clarice Calico

326
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
The only way they could have came in here

327
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
So

328
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Here we are in

329
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
Our Sunday suits

330
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
And here we go trudging through the

331
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Forest

332
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Looking for the key

333
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Respect

334
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
Notable Works looking around

335
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
And then

336
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
We found this

337
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
What are vent

338
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,607
You see the airshaft here they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground

339
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Couple feet across

340
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
That shoots up from

341
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,263
Down in the depths of the Mind be careful that this is giving me such

342
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Yeah you don't want to slide down in there

343
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
And so they couldn't see anything

344
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Down the hole

345
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
So Frank Armani lay down on the ground at the

346
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,855
The edge of The Mineshaft got a flashlight that he takes out my feet

347
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
And let me down in there

348
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
And as Frank got lower down into the hole

349
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,303
I could see her snake

350
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
The blue shoe

351
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
A blue

352
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Sneaker

353
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Bandana leg

354
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
I said to myself this son of a b**** did it

355
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,639
And yells back up to bail to get out of here

356
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Put me back up

357
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Eventually belge found the other body

358
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Alicia house party

359
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
Choosing a cemetery where Garrow had said he'd left her

360
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
But Armani wasn't there when told you found

361
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
So what ensued

362
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
Was a very long struggle

363
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Where the Warriors

364
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
Try to figure out what to do with the information about

365
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
The bodies of these girls

366
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
So what's the other play that out what

367
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
What are your options

368
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,527
Sure so option1 we've got to call the police

369
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
We've got to tell the prosecutor

370
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
These are missing kids

371
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,207
We're the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police

372
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
No you can't

373
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
You just can't

374
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,423
We took her know to keep the confidences of a client under the current rules

375
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Which app developed quite a bit since

376
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
The time is 7

377
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,127
Anything that is related to the representation of a client

378
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Is under the confidentiality umbrella

379
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
So

380
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
You're not supposed to

381
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Tell anybody

382
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,903
Step to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm

383
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
That will be

384
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
That is it can be or will be

385
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
Right so

386
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,120
So in this situation the two girls are dead

387
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Then there's no future crime it's over

388
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
It's done

389
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
And even if

390
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,616
The parents of the missing girls in question

391
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
Are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired

392
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:44,320
Detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that

393
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
But there's no ifs IFS

394
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,976
People are already dead then you do the lawyers

395
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
That's right

396
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,120
It's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you

397
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,448
Have a very particular part to play you you have a roll

398
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
And that roll

399
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
Isn't what you think as a person is

400
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:09,664
Good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member that situation what your role is

401
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Is today

402
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
Play the part of a system in which you're the one

403
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,808
Who stands up for the guy that everybody else

404
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Hates

405
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Even if

406
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
Everybody hates you even if

407
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have

408
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:27,328
To do your job and that job is to be in the role of the person

409
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
That fights as hard as they can for their client

410
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
The lawyer is

411
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
The agent of his client

412
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,104
Only only the agent or Contour also a citizen and a member of the part of the justice system in

413
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
There's a there's a

414
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
There's a double murderer here

415
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,784
And family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happened

416
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Right is there a week your building on

417
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904
On the side of tell just tell

418
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Help

419
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Of course

420
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
Yes and I knew Mr Hogg from Bowling

421
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Persis

422
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
The other daughter my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from churching

423
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
1

424
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
You have to be an animal doctor

425
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Feel

426
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Vanquish is apparent

427
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Of the family

428
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
And yet you have your duty as a lawyer

429
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,744
You're caught between the two more morality

430
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,728
So now what does he do coming up that hard

431
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Spot gets even harder

432
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
We'll be right back

433
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
Hi this is Lizzie from Arlington Texas

434
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,600
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

435

Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world more information about Sloane at WWE

436
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,816
W. Sloan. Org

437
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Okay hey I'm Jared I'm Rod I'm Robert krulwich

438
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
This is Radiolab

439
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
And no

440
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
Get back to our story from producer Brenna Farrell

441
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
When we left it there where they were stock right

442
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,248
Need it with a new this thing believe the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these

443
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Two girls

444
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Now

445
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
What's their next move

446
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Well

447
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
So they decide to

448
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Plea bargain

449
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
The take this information to the prosecutor and

450
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,328
Say I have information that will help you solve some cases

451
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
Some cases yes

452
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
And in exchange I want you to give me

453
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
A better day

454
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Get Garrow into a mental off

455
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Instead of a prism

456
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,384
Oh so right away they're going to use this as Leverage

457
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
That was

458
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
The idea

459
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
You going to give a little and you're going to take a little while that's kind of gross no yeah he's trying to get a better deal

460
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
For this

461
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Murderer but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective

462
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
He's got this information

463
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
As a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea Bargains then that's a way for him to get some clothes

464
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,008
Lawyer for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client

465
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
So crazy again

466
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,408
I called a meeting with Henry McCabe from the state police

467
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,224
And the district attorney at armories office

468
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
And

469
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
When they met

470
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
Army Belgian search the briefcases of the VA in the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug

471
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,744
Because they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug

472
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,304
And then bailed you presents

473
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
The deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies

474
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,752
I want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off to prison

475
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,640
And the prosecutor apparently very quickly puts two and two together and then immediately thought

476
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,992
Holy s*** are you talking about Susan and Alicia like these are the two girls that we are

477
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Most concerned about we think they're alive

478
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
And belge said I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal

479
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,488
Both the VA in the investigator. That the lawyers were absolutely ludicrous

480
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
They thought they lost her mind get a better sentence for a murderer by offer

481
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,984
Is murder victims Are you seriously bargaining with people's lives

482
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,616
Yeah but also I'm sure that the prosecutor do

483
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
That this was doubtless

484
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,480
The highest-profile case

485
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,624
That would ever come to him and so as the prosecutor you're not going to look so good if you give a deal to this

486
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Reprehensible man

487
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
Know well what the hell's the difference is you gonna get life

488
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
No matter what

489
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:47,168
How many times you want to give him life but the meeting only lasted like 5 minutes

490
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,032
Collapses completely to back up a little ways

491
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,872
That was particularly devastating for Armani because just the day before

492
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
Susan Pat's father flown in from Chicago

493
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,760
To Syracuse I remember mr. pets

494
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
Coming to my office

495
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Any side can I meet with you and talk to yuan

496
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
An Armani agreed to it so he comes in

497
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,304
Takes a seat from father to father is there anything you can tell me about my daughter I mean

498
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,840
The papers

499
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,192
Think that that Daryl probably has something to do with her disappearance is there anything at all

500
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
That he's told you that that can help me

501
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,896
I couldn't tell him anything they can't tell you there's nothing I can tell you

502
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Remember trying to

503
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Assure him that

504
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
I've got a meeting set up

505
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,344
All I can say is it's what state investigators

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
The prosecutor on the case

507
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
They could have some information

508
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Trying to

509
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Give them hope

510
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
We will bring it to a conclusion

511
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
I thought we would

512
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
But we did

513
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,704
So then when Mr pets leaves Mr Armani

514
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Elisabeth

515
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
He threw a bunch of books

516
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,360
We got through the phone basically just you know destroyed his office

517
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Just trying to relieve

518
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:08,320
That I couldn't help the man because he's looking right at this man knowing exactly

519
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
Imagine what he's going through like Armani had lost

520
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
A brother

521
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Was much younger

522
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Is 4 years younger than

523
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
Is an Airforce pilot

524
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
And in 1962

525
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Plane went down and he was lost at sea

526
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
So after that Armani said his mother

527
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
She be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night

528
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Cheerleading

529
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
You know she couldn't

530
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Ever recover from it

531
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Because you can't you know you just

532
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
You don't really know but you know

533
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
So

534
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
I can understand that

535
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
And that's

536
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
You know that's partly why this was so hard for her money because

537
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
When that plea deal fell apart that

538
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Was his

539
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Chance to try to get this information to

540
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
The family

541
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,640
When's The Plea fell through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he was stuck

542
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
What's up

543
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,320
What happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that Armani and Dolce have to knuckle down

544
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
I tried to present an insanity defense

545
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Meanwhile

546
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
Armani he said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares

547
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Running down your back

548
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
Go sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee and is waiting for the morning paper to come

549
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
Because he was just alone with that he was

550
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Alone with the secret

551
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
And he knew

552
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
That moment the police are

553
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Trying to find these

554
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
She knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive

555
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
You're questioning yourself

556
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
Very young

557
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
You're hurting people

558
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
Tell you begin to wonder am I in the right profession

559
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
You know you're looking for a

560
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,864
You're looking for a way to give

561
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
The information on

562
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
You know Monica synonymous call

563
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Sure

564
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
Well

565
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,992
If I'm going to do it I want to do it openly yeah

566
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
I don't know

567
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
Did he ever

568
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Fever break

569
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
No

570
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
But according to him know my mind

571
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
I was doing what I thought was the proper

572
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
Ethical legal moral

573
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Moral

574
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Thing

575
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Tutu

576
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
And then

577
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
In December of 1973

578
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
5 months after the girls disappear

579
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
Their bodies happened to be discovered

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Within two weeks of each other

581
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
Susan's body is discovered by two kids were playing up in the mines Alicia I guess I think a student from

582
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,880
Syracuse University which is right next door to the

583
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,488
Cemetery is walking through an instant balls upon her until she's discovered then to

584
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
And then six months later summer of 1974

585
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Even though

586
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,824
Robert quiroz trial for the murder of the blue ski begins

587
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Apparently beaten Not Guilty by reason of insanity

588
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Turn order to make that case what they decide to do is is to put Guerra on the stand

589
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
And Carol would tell his whole life story to shock the jury's mind including all these murders and

590
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,536
Police rapes to see that he was at the time he was not

591
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Sharon Smith Channel 6 News

592
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
So

593
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
The trial opens

594
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
The courtroom is jam-packed

595
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Prosecution starts they have really good case that got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton

596
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
County

597
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
And then it's

598
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
The time for the defense

599
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
To start their case

600
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
Te Velde stands up and he calls his first Witness

601
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Robert Garrow

602
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
To the stand

603
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Girl gets on stand and he

604
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Starts telling his life story and it's

605
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Horrible

606
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
Severe beatings and abuse by parents

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Girl education you basically gets

608
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Sent off to a farm 2

609
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,776
Work like as an indentured servant when he 7

610
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
You're slaughtering Bolognese 8 years old weird stuff like that he starts like drinking blood having sex with the animals

611
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
And then

612
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
He starts admitting to

613
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
A series of rapes

614
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Throughout his adult life

615
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
And

616
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
He

617
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Admits to killing

618
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Alicia and

619
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Susan

620
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
And what happens next

621
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
Nobody's quite sure if it was a slip-up or maybe it was on purpose but when garrow's talking about Sue

622
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
Susan pets

623
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Belge

624
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Says

625
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Is that the one I found

626
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
Is that the one I found

627
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
So the cat was out of the bag then the next day Belgian Armani pull depressed

628
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
Conference to try to explain why they haven't told anyone

629
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
They had the duty to protect their clients secrets

630
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
Is disgusted

631
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
World you're going to convince your average non-lawyer everybody turned against them

632
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
Greek and Avalon of Justice prosecutors let out that our money in Belgium and actually tried to use these dead girl

633
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
As leverage for garro the headlines in the Syracuse papers would say bodies used as Pawns in a game of war

634
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,816
Who is bedlam getting death threats in the mail

635
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
Play how can you live with yourself kill you at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife

636
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
Find sunlit Molotov cocktail in the backyard started to carry a Shotgun in the car

637
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Are kept in the house so we could sleep

638
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Paris

639
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
That was the worst moment of my life

640
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Awesome horrible thought

641
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
I had some more

642
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
June 27th

643
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
Robert Garrow is convicted for the murder of philip domblewski

644
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,400
He's given the maximum sentence he's given 25 years to life

645
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
In a maximum-security prison

646
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
How did how did that feel

647
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Free relief

648
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
Yeah you know

649
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
It's over what

650
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,456
But then it is up to the grand jury at self in their investigation to determine which charges

651
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Green against the

652
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
Pretty soon after the verdict Armani and bailed you learn that they could be facing criminal charges

653
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,952
No one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tempering with evidence

654
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Obstruction of justice or

655
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
State public health law

656
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
And the provision that says that the body must be given

657
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Quick and decent burial

658
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
And on top of that

659
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
Greatest amount of controversy is the one over the attorney-client privilege

660
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,432
There was an ethical complaint filed against Armani and belge so basically they were then facing disbarment

661
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,992
An investigation into the ethical complaint

662
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
That would drag on several years

663
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,648
LG started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida

664
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:13,024
Armani talked it out but he suffered no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore

665
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
What else can I do

666
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
To make a living

667
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
He was just

668
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,544
Barely getting by for a little while I think of all the stress and pressure

669
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
Takes its toll

670
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,640
In fact he has a heart attack

671
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Well this is all going on

672
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
But eventually

673
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,808
The criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint

674
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Is the Smith

675
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
And the reason in a

676
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,232
Opinion of the court and the the State Bar is it Belgian or money did

677
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Was right

678
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
What they did was good

679
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Exactly

680
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,448
According to the law and my view is Frank Armani

681
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
You know real life

682
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Shiro

683
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
I would say you know people

684
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
So admire Atticus Finch in the difference between

685
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
Atticus Finch and Frank Armani

686
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
Is that Armani is real person

687
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,320
Eliza told me about this panel she organized back in 2007

688
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
What is for the American Bar Association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about 400 people in the

689
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
The room most of them lawyers

690
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
They were there to watch

691
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
On stage

692
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,608
The featured speaker Frank Armani

693
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
And it was love

694
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,728
What is this what is that feel like in did you ever think you'd

695
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
Get to that point

696
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
When you were in the midst of the hardest parts

697
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
No

698
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
Never dreamed

699
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,040
I don't think I was a hero I just was a lawyer that did his job

700
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
I mean

701
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
I was a good lawyer

702
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
At least I thought so I everybody

703
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
And now it over 40 years later

704
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
This case let's talk about and what Armani and belge did

705
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Dead bodies case

706
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
Staton law schools across the country everybody

707
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,384
Teaches the case it's like a touchstone

708
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
What it what is

709
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:11,808
People say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense

710
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,904
Dance class here in New York that was being taught at 4.

711
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,000
I agree his duties to his client he represents

712
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
His clients

713
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Interest

714
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,376
Stiff and then sitting in on his classes and in talking to law professors

715
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
I think one of the reasons that

716
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,984
That this case is hot so widely is because

717
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,384
Professors can point that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they

718
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
And say in this situation

719
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
This is what a lawyer should do

720
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
This is what a lawyer should

721
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Should be

722
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
From the moment I started thinking about this story

723
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
I always wanted to talk to the

724
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
Families involved which

725
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Proved really difficult

726
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Wrote letters

727
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
To both families and I made a bunch of phone calls

728
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
And understandably no one wanted to talk to me

729
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
But eventually

730
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
I did Tsar corresponding

731
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
With a family member of one of the

732
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Victims

733
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,928
And she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and

734
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
And after Fue

735
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Phone calls

736
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:29,120
She ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record

737
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
With me on the phone call

738
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Would you mind

739
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Telling us who you are

740
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
Your name in

741
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Occasion

742
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
Okay I'm I'm Roberta pets

743
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Susan

744
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Mother

745
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
Susan was the girl from Chicago

746
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
She's a college student who died

747
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
Gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend

748
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
End

749
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,392
Shih Tzu Armani and algae found in the mine

750
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,976
As I've explained before my interest really

751
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,816
In the story of has to do with the fact that it seems that

752
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
That it's become

753
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
Sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics

754
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
Classes talk about the concept of confidentiality

755
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
And so I sort of wanted to just

756
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Start

757
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
With that idea to ask if that's something that you knew that law schools are teaching and and

758
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
If you had any feelings or thoughts of

759
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,576
I had no idea that this was being taught in law school

760
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,648
And I'm pretty horrified to think that

761
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
This is what

762
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
Is considered to be

763
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Correct

764
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,376
Cuz I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught at the right way

765
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
To do things

766
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
In an ethical classes

767
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
Totally incomprehensible

768
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
And was the first that you'd heard that it wasn't out when I have reached out to you it was

769
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
In talking to you that I know that yet

770
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
Maybe they Odyssey

771
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,344
Not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend

772
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
But what about the victim

773
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
And I think that that should at least be

774
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,512
An equal thought nevermind

775
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
If not

776
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
A greater consideration

777
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
Did it did you have a feeling

778
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:10,240
Did that you really weren't taking into consideration as as all of this was happening

779
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Yes

780
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Only

781
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,384
My husband and I when we first heard that she was missing

782
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
We flew

783
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Immediately in

784
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,784
Went to the police station and

785
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
When we were there

786
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Sitting

787
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
With the police

788
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,512
They received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's

789
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
My daughter's boyfriend

790
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
What his body was found

791
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
And that's that

792
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,496
All we knew and we never really had any updates

793
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
Nobody told us what was going on and

794
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,408
Obviously there was no closure and it was just

795
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Getting worse and worse

796
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,784
And then the only other time we were contacted by the police

797
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Read some Authority I can't even remember who

798
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,744
Was when her body my daughter's body was found like 5 months later

799
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,840
And in the meantime of course we were all going crazy Mike

800
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,144
My father is a matter of fact

801
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,216
Even went so far as to contact the cycle

802
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
That's how

803
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,872
How important it was and how it was our entire life during that period

804
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
And as far as

805
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,224
Visiting the lawyer which my husband did

806
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
It was a total lie lie

807
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
The lawyer

808
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,672
Maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband

809
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
And causing us more months

810
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Abhor

811
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,376
And this is what is being taught in law school

812
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
So anyway

813
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
Just to try to be third ever involved

814
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
As far as I've

815
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
Encountered anyone

816
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,247
By law professors law students there when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are

817
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
They are struggling with the pain that I think the

818
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:05,183
Instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that

819
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
How could

820
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,023
Any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it

821
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
And so I guess that's

822
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
That's why I was hoping to talk to you too kind of

823
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
Let you have a chance to

824
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Communicate some of that

825
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
Experience

826
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
How to really communicate in words

827
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
I mean 40 years later I'm still

828
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,223
I like it and it's soda struggle to

829
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Disgusting

830
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Because

831
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
You'll never go away as long as I live

832
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
I don't know I guess

833
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
Wondering

834
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
We've been talking a lot of

835
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,631
Bad stuff and wondering if there's anything you would like to say about

836
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,983
Susan that the doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know

837
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
That you want to share I don't

838
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Nothing you don't have to

839
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Well

840
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
What can I say she was

841
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
She did receive her degree posthumously

842
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
We we didn't go and pick it up at

843
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Boston University

844
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Difficult for us

845
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
And

846
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
And Danny who is her boyfriend had been just that summer

847
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
And he had a full scholarship

848
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,263
Andrea graduated just a year before and

849
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
So true life

850
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
And I'm sure the other two children him

851
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Great futures

852
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
I haven't been true

853
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
It's just a horrible tragedy

854
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
It's

855
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
It's so

856
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Horrible

857
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
No

858
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
To be in their position

859
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
Do I have to live through that

860
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
I mean

861
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,663
How do you relate Lucina tartar

862
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
I'm worried what excuse is there for

863
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,831
To protecting the person to kill her

864
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,951
No justification you can justify it in my mind

865
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
I don't expect them to accept it

866
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
But

867
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
That's the way it is

868
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
I'm going to get just a minute of

869
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Silence up here if it's okay

870
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
I can hear this

871
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
Echoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up to

872
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
What the hell is going to bounce around

873
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Water I think it's

874
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
From deeper down in there dripping I can't tell

875
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Where is ripping everything up here is

876
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Frozen solid

877
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Sure what that is

878
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
I think I'm going to turn back around

879
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
