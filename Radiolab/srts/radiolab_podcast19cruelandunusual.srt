00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radiolab WNYC

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,320
When was Teletubbies first

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
Auto Bethalto

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,792
Davis Radiolab on Chatham rod

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,400
Today we're going to share with you a story that we did a few years ago on her sister show

8
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
More perfect

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Here's why

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
Couple weeks ago as you may remember

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Attorney General William Barr

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,872
Announce that the US government was going to begin

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,176
Executing federal prisoners again

14
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Last execution was in 2003

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040
Indiana and the Attorney General said

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
The us is going to start doing it again after a quote

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Two-decade-long

18
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
It just so happens over it more perfect

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,352
We believe this was the first episode ever of more perfect we did a deep dive into

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
How we execute

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
People

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
And

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
Given the 8th Amendment

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Whether or not we should

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
I like a good time to bring that story back

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
So here it is

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Comes to us from reporter Karen Duffin

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
And starts with a mystery

29
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,272
Alright so we're starting with

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
Maya Wright Maya Maya

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
I am the director

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
The death penalty team

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Reprieve

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Okay so my afoa lives in London and when she was about 25 she had graduated from college

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
She was doing some theater things but she was like having this

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
Quarter life crisis and didn't know what to do with her life was called boil order but I Central crisis

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
Please can I be useful to you volunteering at a place called for pre legal organization that

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,856
The death penalty cases for they like a bunch of lawyers or what do they do

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,232
See they've been working on the death penalty for like years at that point to try to abolish it

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
I view the death penalty and I

41
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Beautiful at the time instead of the shop ended

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Series of

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
Societal Injustice

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
Tony Macy's at reprieve

45
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
One night this is 2010 I was sat in the office

46
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,408
She sitting there one night and Clive Stafford Smith who's the president of reprieve or the head of reprieve

47
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Calls and says.

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Execution tonight

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,832
The execution in Arizona tonight

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
For killing Chester Drive

51
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
Which found guilty of strangling and stabbing

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
In 1989

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
The client says there's an execution tonight and we just found out that the lethal injection drugs that they're going to use

54
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
It came from a pharmacy in England

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
But we don't know which pharmacy because Arizona refuses to release

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Is the name does anyone in the office have some time alone to have some time to figure out where this trucks could have come from

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
She raises her hand she's like I have 30 minutes you know

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
I didn't know

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
What I was starting when

60
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
I started

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Supplier like why does it help them

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
What the drugs that they want to use an Arizona have to be FDA

63
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,888
So they can find who made these drugs and prove that they are not FDA-approved and they can probably stop there

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,496
Execution do they have any reason to think the drugs weren't FDA-approved is kind of a Hail Mary

65
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Also

66
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,640
I started the half-hour research task it is taking me now five and a half years

67
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
I was trying to figure out with

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Limited information

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
Where sodium thiopental could have come from in the UK to get to the US

70
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,464
Sodium thiopental is an anesthetic and for a long time it was one of the most common anesthetics used in surgeries

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Is also one of the drugs used in lethal injection

72
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
I was so

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
I didn't

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
The puppets full reset that I was doing but I was doing it very quickly

75
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Execution last night

76
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Is running out of

77
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Time

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
And option

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
It was I was in the UK so

80
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
The evening morning Arizona time we had

81
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Number of hours

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
She's like frantically searching

83
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Medical regulations

84
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
And you know she can

85
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Figure out exactly what the name of the company is there's no way to know at that point But ultimately she does figure out that there are

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
No UK

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Companies

88
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
Authorized to ship this drug to the US there was no effect Aveeno FDA approved supplier of

89
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Stop whatever this mystery Pharmacy was

90
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
It probably wasn't FDA approved

91
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
And I remember

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
Can I email that over I think we had the time to intern affidavit

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
From me or from 5

94
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,319
They write up a quick affidavit they send it back to the states and

95
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
The execution that night

96
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Twist

97
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Stayed

98
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Mike halter

99
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
When I went to sleep having stayed and I just thought

100
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
You got a bit of time

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Next morning

102
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Workout

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Couchsurfing

104
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Send someone's

105
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
And I turned on World Service Center

106
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
Been announced that Jeffrey landrigan

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
Was executed at 22

108
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
26 hours

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Yeah

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
His final meal

111
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Was

112
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
A piece of steak

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
His last words were

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Well

115
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
I'd like to say thank you to my family

116
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
And Boomer Sooner

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
It turned out well Maya was asleep

118
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
The state of

119
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
I filled all the way to the

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Quartz and late yesterday

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
The justices by 524 votes

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Lifted the stay of execution

123
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Allowing landrigan tube

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
Be put to death last night

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Was put in place due to concern over

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
Lethal injection drugs one of those drugs obtained from Britain was not FDA-approved but the US Supreme Court

127
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Did rule

128
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
That there was no reason to believe that the drug wasn't

129
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
Nash up about a rude awakening

130
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Is that rude awakening with

131
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,215
Send my on a journey around the world it would get her called out by the United States

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Supreme Court and it would Spark

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
A global conversation about the American death

134
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
Am I felt a little word cruel and unusual

135
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
Are embedded in our 8th

136
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,623
Supreme Court of the United States

137
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Autumn United States

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,799
United States

139
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Dairy bacteria

140
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
The we were in London with Maya who just learned that Jeffrey landrigan had been executed but to understand which

141
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
She does next me just give you a little bit of context

142
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,311
In the fall of 2010 when Jeffrey landrigan was executed

143
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
The drug that they use

144
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
The lethal drug sodium thiopental suddenly in really short supply

145
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Is the only us company that still made that drug was having like a manufacturing problem so they had stopped many

146
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Factoring

147
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Producing this tribe

148
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:31,839
So you actually see these emails between states like dude you have any sodium thiopental

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
From right next door

150
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
Arizona agreed to lend California a cup of death

151
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
And there's actually someone great email exchange between like the California Department of Corrections they send Arizona

152
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Thank you email writing and I quote

153
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
You guys in Arizona are Lifesavers go buy you a beer next time I see you

154
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
You're a lifesaver at come on

155
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,303
Yeah so when Jeffrey landrigan is set to be executed Arizona is out of that drug

156
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,887
And this is how they end up at this mystery Drug Company in London

157
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
So after the execution my is doing all this research she's calling Pharma company on to these documents

158
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
And very quickly she learns that the same company that is sending drugs to Arizona accent drugs till I can buy lots of different states

159
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
South Carolina Kentucky California and various other places

160
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,439
They actually become one of the primary suppliers that we've won Jackson Drugs to the United States

161
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Tell me again why was it so hard to find out information about this company

162
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
So what happens is that anybody involved with an X

163
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Excuse and your name is kept confidential

164
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
And states have started keeping companies names confidential to

165
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
So next she starts calling suppliers and

166
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Distributors

167
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Like how did the

168
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
This drug get to that company thinking that maybe that'll later to it we had figured out

169
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
It had come originally from

170
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
I was active ingredients made in Austria

171
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
Some of those with sent over to Germany

172
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
The package put into biles those were sent over to the UK that was one company that had got the marketing with citation

173
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
There's also another one that company chasing then

174
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
They were sent

175
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
2

176
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Company in England

177
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
But you still can't figure out the identity of

178
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
But then the real breakthrough came to

179
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Couple months after Jeffrey landrigan was

180
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
I think it was a lot of material coming out to that time I'm going to California and the ACLU got a bunch of documents and in one of the

181
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
These batches of documents

182
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
She finds an invoice

Except that it doesn't look like a pharmacy

209
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
Because it's got a big sign on the front that says

210
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063

The company that is helping prop up the death penalty system in America

One guy

239
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
I thought

240
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135

00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671

It wasn't illegal at that point

254
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207

Irrelevant

271
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
Irrelevant to you

272
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
You're not into business

273
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431

Well thank you very much for make sure

275
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879

00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
That's the next step was pretty simple went to the UK government and they told them because in the UK it's Ali

278
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
Legal to be part of capital punishment in any way

279
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
We have a dual sport

280
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Edge products

281
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
For the facilitation of capital punishment

282
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Regulation and deregulation

283
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
The fight against the death penalty

284
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
And

285
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
When they realized

286
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
That the sole purpose of the ex

287
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Sports of this drug

288
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Was

289
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Executions they put an Xbox controller

290
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
And just like that the supply of this drug

291
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Turned off to the states are

292
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Just out of luck

293
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
Well I mean 60% of Americans support the death penalty

294
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
He said that they're not going to give this up

295
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Without a fight

296
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
And so

297
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:30,911
Over the next few years you have like this arms race Missouri says we're going to find the drug in Germany so

298
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Migrants to Germany

299
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
And then she hears that a company called hospira is about to make the drug in

300
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Italian government

301
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
Really didn't want drugs made in the seat of the Pope

302
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
2 p.m.

303
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Dyspraxic you expressing said we cannot take the risk that we will be held liable by the

304
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,815
Italian authorities if the product is diverted for use in capital punishment

305
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
And then

306
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Denmark

307
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
Bunch of stage of Florida Ohio Alabama 11 other states they all decide they're going to get their drug from this company called

Offer

319
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
The intention of

320
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
For this product

321
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,775
Amaya says that she heard the same thing all over the world

322
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,383
Even when States like Nebraska and South Dakota go to India to get their drugs

323
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Interesting in India because

324
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
India have capital punishment

325
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
So this isn't an objection.

326
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
The punishment

327
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
This is

328
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
From every company has spoken to a ninja

329
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
They say

330
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Why

331
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Why would they use medicine

332
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Like if you're going to kill someone just

333
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Kill them

334
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
Why are you using something that saves lives to do it

335
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
And actually there's a really interesting story about why we do it that way

336
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
So what is the answer to life

337
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
Why do dancers that goes back to this guy named Bill Wiseman

338
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
It's a terrible thing

339
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
To have one's

340
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
Reputation B&B based on on

341
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Coming up with a noob

342
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Way to kill people

343
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Bill Weisman was a rising star

344
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Back then

345
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
He loved

346
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,543
Wiseman died in a plane crash in 2007 and this is him in an interview with reporter named Scott Thompson

347
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
Nkotb in Tulsa back in 2005

348
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
What is what

349
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Spell story

350
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
So he grew up his dad's a minister is Grandpa's a minister and he's like I don't want the family business and he want

351
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
First four years he buy his account wonders 3 like 2 and 1/2 literature degrees he becomes a poet

352
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
He drinks a lot of corn liquor and you know he finally end up in construction where he starts working with politicians and he's like oh

353
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,263
This is my calling I want to be a politician so he gets elected to the Oklahoma State Legislature in 19

354
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
1874 end

355
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,639
Opposed to the death penalty and luckily for him this to just happen

356
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Supreme Court

357
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
What declared the death penalty unconstitutional today and spare the lives of six hundred men in death row cells across

358
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,415
What's the country in 1972 the Supreme Court actually abolished the death penalty

359
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Cuz they said it was being applied unfairly herb

360
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Haphazard

361
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
In a way that could only be called

362
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Cricket

363
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,167
So Bill Wiseman is an Oklahoma Legislature and he's like

364
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
Great this is not a problem we'll ever have to worry about

365
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
The problem is the public is furious about this decision

366
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
Support goes from 50 to 63% in just two years

367
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Absolutely I

368
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Very much in favor and favor of it we get some Law & Order into this country.

369
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,303
I don't think I should have taken away in the first place and almost immediately 35 States rewrite their death penalty laws essentially saying like

370
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
We can do this right

371
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
End in 1976

372
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
The Supreme Court says

373
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
All right

374
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,519
If you can administer the death penalty fairly and humanely you can have it back

375
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
So 9072a death penalty abolished 1976 it's reinstated

376
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
Bill Wiseman get selected smack-dab in the middle of this

377
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
So you know 1976

378
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Suddenly

379
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,671
There's a bill in Oklahoma State Legislature about whether to reinstate the death penalty and bilhah

380
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Have to vote on that

381
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
I know

382
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
The capital punishment

383
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Interested it doesn't work doesn't

384
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
I couldn't see any way to justify I also knew

385
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
Terrified voted against it from my district

386
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
I would

387
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335
Run a high chance of getting whooped

388
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
Cuz 80% of his constituents were in favor of the death penalty

389
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
All that wondering

390
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
20 found this job that you love

391
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
Last time I didn't want to get whooped so I was

392
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
In a real dilemma

393
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
What you do

394
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
The wrong thing

395
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
Devoted to reinstate the death penalty

396
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
For whatever reason

397
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,727
Ego or vanity or need or the motivation to get reelected whatever the reasons

398
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
I knowingly made it

399
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
A decision

400
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
When I know is wrong

401
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And ice

402
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,599
Who's in the legislature and he's feeling like he just sold his soul

403
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
And as they're debating various amendments to this law someone brings up something sort of vaguely about a more humane

404
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
Anyway to execute people and he's like that yes that

405
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
And he becomes obsessed with this idea

406
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
I was like a way to assuage his guilt

407
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
Yeah so he brings up some anesthesiologist and doctors and says I want to find a better way to do this and they say we can't help you cuz the

408
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Hippocratic Oath Do no harm death

409
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,735
Is a little bit of firearms 3 goes to the State medical examiner a guy named Jay Chapman

410
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,599
And Jay just sort of like freestyles has one line that that bill

411
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,951
Literally just sits with a yellow legal pad and rights word for word it should

412
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
I'm an intravenous saline drip should be established

413
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
High-end which be introduced

414
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
Hey

415
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Ultra short-acting barbiturate

416
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
In combination

417
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Michael paralytic

418
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,615
The idea is that these three drugs would allow them to execute people but but painlessly

419
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
And right there in that office with just like

420
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Does yellow legal pad

421
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,807
They invent lethal injection in America

422
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
It's it would be

423
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Hard to overstate just how important this

424
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
Moment in this offices because

425
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
The supreme court of justice

426
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,119
Given the country back the death penalty on the

427
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
Grounds and the idea that we could we could do this right

428
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
And what bill has just handed America

429
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
Is is it a way to have the death penalty but but how to be humane

430
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
The ideal death metal

431
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Yeah

432
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
Oklahoma adopted and then the very next date

433
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
Texas does and then dozens of states and

434
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
Since that moment

435
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
88% of all executions

436
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Baidu

437
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Injection

438
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,584
I don't hear the word lethal injection or execution or anything else without

439
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Feeling a tug

440
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
It's tied to me

441
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
I mean I'll always be

442
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Which he live to regret he thinks that he actually extended the life of the death penalty and he actually eventually quit

443
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,176
This job becomes a pastor and becomes a very

444
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
A strong anti-death penalty

445
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Advocate

446
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
How does a man

447
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Who came up with the recipe

448
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
For lethal injection

449
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
What does he do on judging

450
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
The same thing everyone else does

451
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
So ourselves on the mercy of God

452
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Say that way

453
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Have done wrong and where

454
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,776
Nothing that I find really interesting is that if you look at the Modern lethal injection cocktail

455
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,872
Three drugs affect drug special needs Society II drug paralyzes you

456
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
And the Third Reich is the actor that stops the heart in

457
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
Kelsey in this drug cocktail you kind of see everything that we want and need from the death penalty just kind of all

458
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Together

459
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,744
The third drug that stops your heart that's kind of our sense of justice

460
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
The first drug the anesthetic

461
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Kind of our sense of humanity or kindness

462
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
That second drug

463
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
The one that paralyzes their muscle

464
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
I told the second draw

465
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Is purely cosmetic

466
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
It sucks

467
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
No medical purpose

468
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,968
The reason it was put into the lethal injection cocktail in the first place was

469
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
So that

470
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
It's the first truck doesn't work effectively

471
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,672
The second drug will mask any signs of

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,536
Visible suffering and it would be extremely significant

473
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
Because potassium chloride

474
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
Potent acid that people have described as being like fire going through your veins and beings

475
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Bentley from the inside

476
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
She said just imagine that that's happening to you

477
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,920
But something is wrong with the anesthetic and you become conscious

478
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
You have this

479
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
Burning acid going through your body

480
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
And you're paralyzed all your voluntary muscles are paralyzed

481
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
So you can't say

482
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,720
I'm awake I can feel everything this is agony

483
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,864
She says that it's that second drug that is both the thing that could make the execution most torturous

484
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
And the thing that meant that

485
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Tweed Witnesses reviews

486
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Public

487
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Wouldn't know that it was torture

488
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
Because we weren't supposed to know that

489
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
Two does she end up going after that second Reich the paralytic no actually seek she goes after the first ride the anesthetic and it's

490
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
A total coincidence this is just

491
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
The one that had manufacturing problems with starter

492
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
The arms race

493
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,696
But it turns out that this drug

494
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Sodium fire

495
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
The anesthetic is the one that's

496
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
The most constitutionally important Drive

497
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
Because in 2008 when the Supreme Court ruled on lethal injection they said

498
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,544
The first drug is necessary to prevent the prisoner

499
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
From experiencing severe pain

500
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
So there's no anesthetic

501
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
There is pain

502
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,528
Which would be too severe and then be there for what an Eighth Amendment violation

503
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Cool unusual punishment exactly

504
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
So that drug the anesthetic is the key drug

505
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:33,792
But over the past five and a half years is Maya has like Wacom old her way across these different companies

506
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
She just made it harder and harder to get

507
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
There now 20 + companies

508
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
Who have they said we disapprove of the misuse of medicines and executions and we're going to take steps to prevent

509
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
And that has States scrambling the drug use and it's 32 death penalty States or now

510
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:58,368
Running out they have run out of drugs and it's a result of what you've seen is that things have gotten very DIY

511
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,208
I'm trying new procedures never used before in the history of execution

512
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,024
Prison officials are in a difficult position

513
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
Human have the DEA start raiding prison

514
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
Their Central using illegal drugs at this point until reporters are just starting to pay more attention and

515
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,968
In the middle of all that he began kicking his feet lifting his head in his chest off the gurney grimacing

516
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
How do you also get

517
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Seems like this

518
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,600
High Country cast season in and a couple moments he actually mumbled

519
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:35,232
He would open his mouth and you'd see his chest move and we'll go all the way down to stomach so so clear gas

520
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
April 29th 2014 in Oklahoma a man in Clayton Lockett was being executed for murder rape in

521
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
Kidnapping Lockett execution used a new drug combination whose source is unknown he was sedated and declared unconstitutional

522
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Conscious but

523
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Started thrashing

524
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Clenching his teeth and start moving the arm

525
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
43 minutes to die

526
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,808
Risley horrific spectacle

527
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,160
Happening after an hour and 57 minutes

528
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,560
Your situations like this in Arizona Ohio this drug formula is unconstitutional because boobs

529
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,144
Started filing a bunch of lawsuits and one of these eventually got to the

530
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Supreme Court

531
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
1479 55in interesting Lee when it got to the Supreme Court

532
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Honest about what's going on

533
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
Things got very tense

534
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
This is Justice Alito

535
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
Is saying essentially

536
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Actually a problem you made it a problem

537
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Executions could be carried out

538
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
Actually there many jurisdictions

539
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
Their jurisdictions in this country their jurisdiction

540
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
By the Abolitionist Movement

541
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,776
And this is Justice Scalia

542
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,336
So that the states cannot obtain

543
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
Vote to Other Drugs

544
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,968
And now you want to come before the court and say well

545
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
It's not 100% sure

546
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
Is it appropriate for the Judiciary

547
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
To countenance what amounts

548
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
To a guerrilla War

549
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Against

550
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
What you think it means by Guerilla War

551
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Thank you

552
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
Trying to say there are ways to 2 if you want to make the death penalty illegal you have ways to do it

553
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,920
You can call your legislator you can pressure them think about

554
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,760
The law but you're trying to like hide in the trees and like pulled

555
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Drugs off

556
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
And

557
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Make themselves scarce

558
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
That you're forcing

559
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
Illegal problem that doesn't exist

560
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,792
Without you answer to the question

561
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
You've been interrupted

562
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,656
Does justice has called you guys out kind of

563
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Yeah

564
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
It's

565
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Look into this a lot of narrative around this being

566
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Thriller activity

567
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
But this is nothing to do

568
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
With me or anyone else

569
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
It's that the companies

570
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
Don't want that medicines ucinet

571
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,112
Executions the manufacturers that Distributors the pharmacist anesthesiologist

572
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
Whoever else it might be the Indian industry

573
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
None of them has to be positive

574
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Ohio capital punishment machine

575
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
Listen to an argument to be made here I mean I get what you're saying that like all these different people in different countries have been like unknowingly

576
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
Grafted onto Ohio sex

577
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,080
Execution team which doesn't seem fair but is there an argument to be made that like

578
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
Even so

579
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,200
The effect is that she has taken a death penalty that is

580
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
Kind of Humane Maybe

581
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
And made it more cruel

582
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
Because that's kind of the accusation in the air

583
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
It's

584
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,952
I'm going to say two things one of them throw away

585
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:52,352
She didn't cause it she's the states are chasing the companies and she's chasing the states right so like you can't say that

586
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,472
She caused it but what you more importantly what you also can't say is that it is actually more cruel

587
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Because

588
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
There's no evidence

589
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
That there's been an increase

590
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Christen Bachelor

591
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,664
Executions what I think is happening is just that we're paying

592
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
More attention to Lisa Lynch

593
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Tonight we're just

594
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Looking at it more

595
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
Oh you mean like a

596
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Bosch excuses been happening forever and we're just now noticing

597
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Yeah

598
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,720
Nonetheless people do accuse her of making this more cruel and not just because of

599
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
The drugs

600
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Because

601
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
States in their sort of desperation to

602
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
To still be able to do this are looking for other ways

603
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
To do it

604
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
And some of those ways

605
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
Might seem like we're going

606
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
The lady that was

607
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,152
Spearheaded they getting rid of the injections all she did is basically force people to be shot

608
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,248
This Paul Wray state representative house district 13 Utah

609
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
He says one day he was sitting in his office

610
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,672
I was actually listening to the local NPR station and federal judge in Oklahoma is

611
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:53,792
And they were talking about European pharmaceutical companies used to provide this controversy

612
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Drug but now refused to sell it to America

613
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,936
Do prisons have the European drug companies no longer selling the drug cocktail

614
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,800
So I called our department of corrections and says hey do we have access to the drug and they said no we don't

615
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
How you know we have a set amount and then we're out

616
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
He says he hung up the phone did a little thinking a little bit of research

617
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
Kind of deep into the history and

618
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Eventually

619
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,624
Came to the conclusion to the firing squad

620
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
Play me like firing squad John Wayne firing squad like line up against the wall know it's like they have a chair and they bring the

621
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
Person into the room and they strap them to the chair they put a hood over their head physician will look at the heart and I'll pin a Target where the heart is

622
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
And then there's five men with rifles and one of them had the blank but none of them know which one it is

623
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
And they all shoot the individual in the higher

624
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
Doughmakers in Utah supposed to bring back executions by firing squad

625
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,720
What is Lethal Injections are not readily available already says he was just trying to solve a problem

626
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:01,120
I was completely taken off guard by the media frenzy that

627
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
That half of cruel relic of Old West Justice International condemnation

628
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Adopting it now is an embarrassment of barbaric

629
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Bob Moses

630
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Why is it that the

631
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Do you think the

632
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
The firing squad itself

633
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Created thesaurus

634
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Well it is

635
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
It's brutal

636
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
You know it's it's certainly not the easy

637
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
Give him a couple of injections and

638
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
They quietly go down

639
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
You know this is calling it for what it is

640
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
In fact

641
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
I would argue you want to look at

642
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
At something that's more Humane and you definitely the firing squad

643
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
What caught my attention

644
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
Was it it was so sudden so quick

645
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,992
Boom boom just like that he's our reporters talking about witnessing at firing squad

646
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Houston and Utah

647
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
It was over

648
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
Pretty quickly it was cleaner than I expected

649
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
And it was fast

650
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
With the firing squad

651
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Yeah your ear dead Within

652
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
The seconds of the pulling the trigger

653
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
Bible is directly to the heart

654
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
It's over

655
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,168
Not the paralytic that hides its is done

656
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Body can be removed

657
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
He moved a little bit

658
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
To some degree that bothers me

659
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
And that seemed to carry on

660
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Alaska

661
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
6227

662
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,232
This is how you tie his chosen to solve the whack-a-mole problem

663
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,304
Has already been upheld by the Supreme Court approved

664
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Electrocution

665
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
We have approved

666
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
Death by firing squad

667
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,800
That's Justice Scalia in 2008 the Supreme Court actually approve the firing squad in 1879

668
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,408
And the people who were part of the firing squad are actually volunteers

669
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Do you have a

670
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,088
Lack of volunteers are in abundance of volunteers

671
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Nobody's forced

672
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Todoist

673
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,720
You know they're there are people that are willing that big Tennessee is their civic duty

674
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Setting of the help carry these out

675
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,584
I'm always down there I actually asked Paul

676
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
I really want to talk

677
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Talk to a volunteer

678
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
If you put me in touch with somebody who's

679
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Actually been involved with the firing squad

680
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Okay

681
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
I wait till this thing

682
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
16th and Hill Air Force Base bombing range right I like it the sound of Freedom this is Kenny we agreed not to use his last name

683
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Weekends Dad ran the firing squad for a couple of deck

684
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,792
So as you see there's two cottonwood trees over here those old cottonwood trees made setup

685
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
And that's what they would drill the firing

686
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Squad app

687
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
These men were selected because for one there

688
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
Absolute Marksman

689
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
2

690
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
They just had moral clarity.

691
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
They

692
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
Many of them did not want to be on there but once

693
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
They were called

694
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
They felt obligated to see it

695
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Ken told me that on

696
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:02,880
Keisha days he died and the other Shooters they would sit down together at the kitchen table

697
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Family breakfast

698
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
His mom should make coffee and

699
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,048
She would do scones or biscuits and gravy and she wanted those men to know

700
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
That it wasn't easy and that she appreciated him

701
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
I know there was a lot of prayerful times around the house and nose

702
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
Mentor over getting ready I know that

703
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Ian

704
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,152
It's pretty solemn moment I prayer

705
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Is it for the person Phoenix

706
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
You did the victim with the

707
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
The prayer I think you have to pray for strength

708
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
The follow through on what you have to

709
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
I think that

710
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
You know you might need a little guidance and you might need a little understanding and

711
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
And something bigger than yous out there

712
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,960
I think that if we're going to have the death penalty people just have to understand that there's some savagery involved in it

713
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
And nah

714
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
It's unfortunate

715
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
But it is but

716
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
If we have it to do list

717
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
Let's do it let's do it humanely

718
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
One of the things that I found kind of striking is that

719
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
Maya foa is against the death penalty in Europe

720
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
The folks in Utah that are for it

721
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
But everyone seems to agree that

722
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
We shouldn't fool ourselves favors the death penalty but one thing I've never favored in some common ground between

723
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
When me and the abolitionists

724
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
Is that lethal injection is a terrible method of x

725
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Execution

726
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,848
That's Robert blecker at a New York law school Professor sounding a little bit like Maya

727
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,992
But he says he objects to lethal injection not because it's cruel not because it might cause pain

728
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,832
But because it certainly causes confusion I attended

729
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
An execution in Florida

730
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Bennie Demps

731
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,280
And I also was with my father-in-law when he was in a hospice dying

732
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
From an incurable and very painful

733
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Cancer

734
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
And the death scene in both

735
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
Situations was

736
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Bizarrely similar

737
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
In both cases

738
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Served

739
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,824
The person dying was

740
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,896
Lying on a gurney with an IV coming out of his arm

741
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Wrapped in white sheets

742
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Medical technicians at his side

743
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
Surrounded by loved one

744
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
And it struck me as bizarre

745
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,184
That we are killing Those whom we love

746
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
In a fashion

747
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,840
That's so nearly resembles how we are killing those we rightfully

748
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Detest

749
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
There should be no resemblance this isn't medicine this is

750
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Punishment

751
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
The firing squad

752
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Is honest

753
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
And acknowledges

754
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Itself

755
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
For what it is

756
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
I want objection to the traditional firing squad

757
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:39,296
That Utah uses he says he doesn't like the fact that one person get the blank and that nobody knows who that poor

758
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
Person is that to me is symptomatic

759
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,208
Of our failure once again to take responsibility for what we do

760
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Nobody should have a blank

761
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
If we cannot face what we're doing

762
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
And acknowledge

763
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Then we shouldn't do it

764
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
And we may be coming to a moment where we are about to do that to it look at this and acknowledge

765
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Because

766
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,576
In 2014 in a case that was really just about lethal injection just as viruses look like

767
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
Stop

768
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,232
Just talking about the details I questions about which medicine that we use

769
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Eight more basic question

770
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
Weather

771
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
In other words what he's saying is

772
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,312
It's time to talk about not just like the mechanics

773
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
So what we're doing

774
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
But whether we should even do it at all

775
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
Reporter Karen Duffin

776
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
Now when Justice Breyer said that in 2014 he was in The Descent but a lot of people

777
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
Heard that statement as kind of an invitation like Briar saying to the lawyers of America

778
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
Send us cases about this up next level conversation with a brother and sister

779
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
Team of dedicated their lives to studying the death penalty and they'll tell us when we can expect that next big case

780
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
Whether or not Spring Court might ultimately Force the country to join the rest of the West

781
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
In abolishing the death penalty once and for all back in the moment

782
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:45,248
Hi my name is Santiago Fernandez from Madrid Spain

786

Technology in the modern world

787
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
More information about Sloane at wwd

788
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
I'm glad this is Radiolab we're back with our story from more perfect

789
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
About the death penalty which were we playing

790
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
Because of the attorney-general's recent announcement

791
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
I just a moment ago at the conclusion that second we heard Justice Breyer inviting cases about the death penalty up to the sky

792
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
Supreme Court saying basically it's

793
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Time for the court to revisit the question

794
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Constitutionality

795
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,256
At the time we first reported this we wanted to find out a little more about that

796
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,120
What exactly does that mean when will it happen when might it happen I should say

797
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656
What might it look like

798
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
So we set

799
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Reporter Sean rameswaram out

800
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
To look into that

801
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
What are you to stand on the death penalty

802
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Guess

803
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
I figured I'd just ask and we found two siblings actually who dedicated their lives

804
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
Studying capital punishment in America

805
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm Carol steiker I'm a professor at Harvard Law School

806
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
Earlier in my career I was

807
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Law Clerk

808
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
For justice Thurgood Marshall

809
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,960
For him Jordan also collect two years later

810
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
My name is Jordan steiker I'm a professor of the universe

811
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
City of Texas School of Law

812
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
And I'm the direct

813
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Picture of the University of Texas

814
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
Toccoa Falls camping

815
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Punishments

816
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
And you two are related

817
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,832
We are most people think we're married but in fact we're brother and sister

818
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
How do I exact but most people think you're married to your brother

819
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
We have a great line people often ask us how we met

820
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
And I say our parents brought him home from the hospital

821
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
I wasn't very impressed

822
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
So our story

823
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Starts

824
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
With

825
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
This execution

826
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Being halted

827
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,176
And then eventually being resumed in what sounded the middle of the night it's happening like after hours

828
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Satf prison

829
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
How is it that the

830
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Supreme Court

831
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
The most

832
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
Vaunted and in our nation

833
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Deals

834
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
Local life or death

835
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
Last-minute calls at all hours of the days

836
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Is

837
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
RBG on call all day and all night.

838
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Everyone knows now

839
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
The US

840
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Supreme Court

841
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Is the last

842
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Stop for a second

843
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Execution

844
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
That's just a

845
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Fact of life

846
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
When we were Locklear

847
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
On the court

848
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Late 1980s

849
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
We would stay until late in the evening it was the job of

850
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Whoever.

851
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
The clerk was in each Chambers

852
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
Who was

853
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Responsible for that

854
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Mycase

855
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Just stay in Chambers

856
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Until the case

857
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Made it

858
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
To the court and was either

859
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Stayed or

860
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
The Condemned with x

861
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
Okay there was

862
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Prominent

863
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Clerk in the

864
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
Clerk's Office

865
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
Of the Supreme Court who is known as the deathclaw

866
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
His job was to keep track is to keep

867
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,247
Keep track of all of the death cases that are coming to the court

868
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
Their execution date

869
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
And to stay in touch

870
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
With the attorneys on both sides

871
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,743
Do we think a death clerk gets paid more than a regular clerk for having maybe the worst job in the building

872
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,559
Good question don't know the answer.

873
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Okay

874
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
I'm curious where are

875
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Current 9 Justice

876
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Is come down

877
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
On the death penalty right

878
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Evenly

879
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Split the train

880
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Justices

881
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,919
To just a quick note obviously that conversation happened a little while ago

882
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,015
The story of Justice Antonin Scalia passed away

883
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
Justice Anthony Kennedy retired

884
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
To New Jersey

885
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,159
This is her now on the court Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh which means

886
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Course the court looks

887
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
A bit different

888
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
When we check back in with Carol

889
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:46,143
She said that while she thinks that this court is much less likely to strike down the death penalty

890
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,727
She still thinks that given recent events in States like

891
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
California

892
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
We're Governor Newsom recently stay all X

893
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Executions

894
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
There is

895
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,175
Still a general movement away from the desk

896
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,319
Carol also pointed out that while the Attorney General's announcement may seem to be pointing Us in the opposite direction

897
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,415
There are only six federal prisoners on death row where is in California

898
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
That stay of execution

899
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Applied to more than

900
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
700

901
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Death row

902
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
We do think

903
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
That the death penalty will eventually

904
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Be struck down as

905
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,215
Unconstitutional under the 8th Amendment

906
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,383
Simply because the way the court has thought about it and the cases in which has narrowed the death penalty recently

907
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
So that in the last 15 years the Supreme Court has said that people

908
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,807
With intellectual disability

909
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
Can't get the death penalty that juvenile offenders

910
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
Can't get the death penalty

911
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,255
That people who commit interpersonal crimes other than murder

912
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
Can't get the death penalty

913
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,863
In these cases where the Supreme Court has

914
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Constrained

915
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
The scope of the death penalty

916
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
They made it clear that

917
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
The analysis involves considering weather

918
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
The practice

919
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
Violates evolving standards of decency

920
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
It seems like

921
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
The death penalty is on a collision course

922
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
With the Supreme Court's

923
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
Eighth Amendment jurisprudence

924
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
And it's close court-watchers and

925
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
People have service clerks in the court

926
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Yourselves

927
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
When do you think that case

928
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Coming

929
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:24,191
It's hard to say 2 years ago many people thought then when that when justices

930
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
Breyer and Ginsburg

931
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
Signed on to that $0.02

932
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,359
They were signaling that the time was nigh and that there were

933
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Perhaps five votes

934
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,015
On the court why else would they call for the court to take this

935
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Issue up

936
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Record

937
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Not A legislature

938
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,839
Bacon

939
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Cruel

940
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
And unusual

941
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Punishment

942
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
And

943
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,127
With a specific constraint

944
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
Set the Constitution imposes

945
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Process

946
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Namely

947
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Through the 8th Amendment

948
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,647
In the two years since there have been many opportunities

949
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
Is for the court to do so

950
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
And it has

951
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
So that suggests

952
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,351
That the time is last night

953
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Court watch

954
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
I thought it might be 2 years ago

955
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
We also think that the one major difference

956
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,311
This time which makes it so much more likely

957
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
At the death penalty will eventually be abolished

958
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
If the extent to which the United States

959
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
Stands virtually alone

960
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
In a few

961
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
And retention of the death penalty

962
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Among

963
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
Western democracy

964
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
All of our peer Nations

965
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
Have

966
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
Jettison the death penalty

967
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
And it's not

968
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,143
The outlier status is more remarkable than that it's not just that we're the only Western democracy

969
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Say to retain the death penalty

970
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,775
We're still one of the world's leaders in executions even with the

971
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,847
Decline and executions the United States were

972
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
In a very small Club of active

973
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Executing countries

974
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
Along with countries like

975
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
Iraq around China

976
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
United States is really in a very

977
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
Small group of Nations that

978
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
Uses the death penalty

979
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
An irregular way

980
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,607
Seabright who's a anti-death penalty lawyer for most of his career is quite well known

981
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
He used to joke that in 1970

982
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:37,055
If you would ask anyone in 1970 which of the following three countries would be the only one

983
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,383
That would still have the death penalty at the turn of the millennium

984
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
Russia South Africa

985
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
And United States

986
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Yeah nobody

987
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
Would have picked the United States

988
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
Bread in the 1970s

989
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
Only sixteen countries in the world

990
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
We're fully abolitionist

991
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
By law

992
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
Today more than 2/3

993
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Of the countries in the world

994
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
Are abolitionists by law

995
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,983
Last I heard 60% of people approve of the death

996
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Is that true

997
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
Well depends on how you ask

998
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,639
The question the Gallup polling organization

999
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
Has been asking people the same very simple

1000
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Question

1001
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
Do you support the death penalty

1002
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Kiefer murder

1003
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
For almost a hundred years

1004
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,391
So it's easy to compare you're comparing Apples to Apples

1005
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
And

1006
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,999
Support for the death penalty is around

1007
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
60th percent now

1008
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,119
Which is down from 80 something percent

1009
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
In the early 1990s

1010
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
But if you ask

1011
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
The question in a different way for example if you ask

1012
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
People whether they support the death penalty

1013
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,431
Or life without possibility of parole

1014
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,503
I see you got very close to 50/50

1015
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
And if you ask people

1016
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,855
Whether they support the death penalty or

1017
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
Life without parole

1018
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
With a

1019
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,767
Prisoner working for restitution to the victim's family

1020
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,327
Support for the death penalty drops below

1021
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
It's one of the more striking

1022
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:10,751
Figures is the number of states that have legislatively repealed the death

1023
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Penalty

1024
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
In recent years so seven states

1025
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
Passed repeal bills

1026
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
In the last

1027
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
10 or so years

1028
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,527
One of them Nebraska really the only Red State to do so

1029
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,135
Brought the death penalty back to a referendum procedure last November

1030
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,999
But the fact that it's Republican legislature repealed the states that pain

1031
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,583
And then the Republican Governor veto that repeal

1032
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:41,727
And then the Republican legislature overrode the governor's veto bike with a two-thirds majority

1033
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
Is a pretty striking indication

1034
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
Of change

1035
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
And public attitude

1036
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
So what do we think is change

1037
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
I think there are a couple of things that have accounted for the decline in public

1038
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Support

1039
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,855
One thing that happened in the 1990s with there was a

1040
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Growing awareness

1041
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
Of wrongful

1042
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,767
Write the decline in violent crime

1043
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
The 1970s and 80s

1044
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
An extraordinary Rising

1045
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Violent crime in the United

1046
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Stay tuned.

1047
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
That trend has reversed

1048
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,519
Took some significant extent

1049
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,591
And I also think that the concern about

1050
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,175
Ordinary crime has been displaced Abid

1051
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
I concern about

1052
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
Terrorism in

1053
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
And other threats

1054
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Better

1055
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
More X

1056
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,135
Existential than ordinary crime in the United

1057
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
It's also been the case that

1058
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,303
Because of the Court's intervention the death penalty the death penalty has become

1059
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Extraordinary expenses

1060
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Yeah just

1061
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Put a figure on that

1062
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
If you look at how much

1063
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
The state of California

1064
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,775
Has spent on a death penalty

1065
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,359
Trials appeals maintaining death row

1066
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
And you add that money up

1067
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,711
And you divide it by the 13

1068
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Situations that California has

1069
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Has carried out

1070
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
In the last 40 years

1071
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
You got a price tag

1072
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
Of more than a quarter of a billion dollars

1073
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
Rice serious

1074
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:12,607
Did you give everyone in America knew that we'd still be a 60% it's kind of hard to imagine

1075
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
What you could do

1076
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,703
To address legitimate concerns about

1077
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Crime and Public Safety

1078
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,543
With a quarter of a billion dollars

1079
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
Other than execute another person

1080
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
I think it's important to realize that in

1081
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
All of our Pure Country

1082
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
Is that abolish the death

1083
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,063
A majority of the public

1084
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Supported the death penalty

1085
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
At the time of abolition

1086
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
The

1087
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,487
Support for the death penalty in Western Europe

1088
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
Tell only after

1089
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
The abolition

1090
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Have the death penalty

1091
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Not before

1092
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,399
But those countries have much more

1093
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,703
Parliamentary procedures

1094
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,031
They're more insulated from populist lawmaking

1095
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
And they tend to defer to Elites

1096
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,407
And to expertise on criminal justice

1097
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
The policy

1098
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
The other

1099
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
Truly extraordinary exceptional

1100
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Facet

1101
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,367
The American death penalty in the modern era is that

1102
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,463
And I think most people my age I'm 32 I was born in the 1980s

1103
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,791
I feel like most people my age don't even really know

1104
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
Is that we got rid of it for 4 years

1105
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,911
We got rid of it actually for longer than that

1106
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,543
Because the litigation that led up to the case Furman versus Georgia that abolished the death

1107
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Penalty

1108
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,407
Brought the death penalty to a halt for five years

1109
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Prior to that ruling so there were no X

1110
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,015
Secretions in the United States

1111
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
Between 1960

1112
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,135
87 and 1972 when the Supreme Court abolished at

1113
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
524 again

1114
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
What's the death penalty

1115
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
Justices Brennan and Marshall

1116
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
Unusual

1117
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
They would prohibit

1118
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Entirely

1119
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Wouldn't go quite

1120
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
He said the death penalty

1121
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
More than half of

1122
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
And then there were no executions

1123
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:07,039
Between 1972 and 1976 when the Supreme Court brought it back

1124
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,183
And then the first execution after the Revival of the death penalty was actually Gary Gilmore

1125
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,487
Who volunteered gave up all his

1126
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Appeals

1127
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
Wanted to BX

1128
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
In Utah in 1977

1129
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,215
So there was a ten year period 1967 to 1977

1130
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
In which there were no executions in the United

1131
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
What's the longest.

1132
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
You guys

1133
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,431
Site were alive in that. Some of it all of it

1134
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
Children but we were alive

1135
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:42,879
I mean thank you very much you're welcome so curious I mean

1136
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,999
What was that like what was what was in the air then and

1137
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,351
Was it just a fight to bring it back the whole time or did it

1138
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,119
Free

1139
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,447
Criminal justice reformers up to worry about

1140
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,007
Overpopulation of Prisons or

1141
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
The sword

1142
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,335
Prison industrial complex in this country did it

1143
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:07,967
Did it make the country function better in some way or was it just a really bad I mean

1144
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
The moment

1145
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,063
At which the death penalty was

1146
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Spend it

1147
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Was

1148
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,415
One of the most turbulent moments in American history

1149
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
It was

1150
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
You know right in the wake of

1151
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
Violence of the late 1960s

1152
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,631
That brought that swept Richard Nixon into

1153
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
The presidency

1154
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,751
And his promise was to restore Law and Order

1155
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,031
There was

1156
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
An enormous

1157
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
Political backlash when the Supreme Court

1158
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,223
Struct down the prevailing death penalty statutes in 1972

1159
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
So even though it was a. Without X

1160
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Profusion

1161
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
It was not a. Free

1162
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
No pro-death penalty

1163
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,255
Agitation impact it might have been

1164
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,839
The most extreme. A pro death penalty agitation

1165
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,911
Because of the perception that the Supreme Court

1166
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Was taking away the

1167
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Best power from the state

1168
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Anythink

1169
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
If your

1170
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
Hypothesis Bears out in the

1171
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Supreme Court

1172
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
What does abolish

1173
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
The death penalty

1174
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
In the neck

1175
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
10 20 30 40 50 years

1176
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,087
Do you think it will be gone

1177
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
For good

1178
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
This time

1179
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,463
I do think that this time would be different

1180
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,279
Last time when the Supreme Court abolished

1181
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,095
And then four years later blinked and brought it back

1182
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
It did so in a way

1183
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,959
Of saying

1184
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Well

1185
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
These new statutes look like they're going to fix

1186
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,871
Some of the concerns about arbitrariness and

1187
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,919
Discrimination and lack of adequate

1188
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Process

1189
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
That was 40 years ago

1190
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
It's pretty clear those statutes

1191
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,319
Didn't do what many p

1192
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
People who pooped that they would do

1193
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
I don't think it's possible for the court

1194
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,559
To take another mend it don't end it approach you know they tried that and we've all tried that for really

1195
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,607
Long time if it happened next year

1196
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
If the Supreme Court abolished

1197
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
The death penalty

1198
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
Next year

1199
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
With some

1200
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
Degree of finality

1201
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:12,383
What do you think you guys would do what's the second what's the second biggest issue for

1202
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,199
Oh there's so many Sean

1203
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
I'd say probably

1204
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,551
The two biggest issues are

1205
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,135
Mass incarceration the number of people that the United States

1206
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Loksatta

1207
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
And for how long wear an outlier

1208
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
In that area as well

1209
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:33,887
And the ways in which our criminal justice policies really punish people for poverty

1210
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
The incredible fees and fines and bail amounts that end up locking people up in prayer

1211
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
Prisons and jails

1212
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,919
Not actually for the crimes which are often pedi that they've committed

1213
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
Because they can't pay

1214
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:52,319
Court cost for court fines or bail in order to get out

1215
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
I'll just add that I would be thrilled for the captain

1216
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
Punishment Center at the University of Texas

1217
