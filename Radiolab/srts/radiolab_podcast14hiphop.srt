1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Radiolab

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,896
From WNYC

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
And NPR

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,320
Hey I'm Jared I'm Roberto but you should Radiolab podcast

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
Okay so Robert here's a question that I've been puzzling over

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
For a long time

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
What is the fruitiest fruit

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
I'd let you know

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
My food is fruit is a plum

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
Well now I mean that's well that's yours

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
You know you shouldn't

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960
When you ask most people that question they say

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Apple

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
Orange

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
No I mean it's true

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,128
Side of the figured out that when you make a category in your mind you're not doing it based on

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
Setlist

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Traits

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
You're like

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
You quit you do you call to mind

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
D prototypical example

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,392
Of that category and then you measure this new thing against it

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
And for fruits

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,976
Prototype is the gala apple

27
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
If you asked me to

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Red shiny waxy Apple you say there's somebody has decided that an apple is the fruity fruit experiment

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Experiment bananas

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Call Apple

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Consumption Maybe

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
I bet. That's not what makes a fruitiest fruit

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Fruity fruit

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
It's more about like how well it represents

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
The category

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
That's what it's about who we talkin about this though

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
Well because I've been wanting to explore this in story form

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Forever

39
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,160
Could you never have a story so that's like a you never find a store but I got one now

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
You did what it's not about Frito what is about

41
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
About this

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
What is the weather

43
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Let me explain

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,616
So I met this guy Andrew Marantz I work at the New Yorker as an editor and I

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Right Stuff

46
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Occasionally 100 in here one day by mistake I think Super interesting guy Gregory Porter and he end up talking with us

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
About this story was reporting for the New Yorker

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
But they're all

49
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Kinds of rappers

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720
And how hip-hop might be changing

51
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,536
As we all know this was a genre of music that began

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
Really specific time and place

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Bronx

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
70s black and Latino kids

55
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
But it's since expanded

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
So much

57
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
It is inevitable questions pop

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
You know what to really simplify it

59
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
The more white people come to the party

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
The

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
More you kind of start going okay at what point is it

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
It's clearly a it can clearly it's really okay if everyone in the room is black

63
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:38,208
And it's okay if everyone is black except for one guy you know if ya if Rick rubin's at the party

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
But it's still

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
You know black people at the tunnel

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
In 1989 or whatever it's still okay

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
But

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,728
At what point okay with its 50% white if it's 75% wife

69
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
If all the people who own the record labels are white if

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
A majority of the popular rappers are white like at what point

71
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,528
Yeah then there's also that sonically the way it sounds there's the way the production is going to merge with other forms of music

72
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
So then all the sudden you're at a point where

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
You get the sense that there's somehow inherently

74
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
That there's something being replaced

75
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
We're taking over you start to have this

76
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Dilemma

77
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Which is

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
You know who owns the music now and

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
The Dilemma is obviously heightened by the fact that

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Everyone knew this was coming

81
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
Like if there's never been a form of American popular music

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
As far as I know that wasn't invented by black people and co-opted by white people

83
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
And Andrew in his peace

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,760
I need the story of focuses on a guy who sits right

85
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Part of that

86
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
One of the most influential DJs in hip-hop today

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
Peter Rosenberg

88
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,976
So tell me tell me how you came to him I mean the first

89
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Thing was

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Torn hip hop radio station

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
Listening to

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
That part 97

93
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
Because I

94
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Like crap and I want to know

95
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
What is popular

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
And I was

97
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,664
Listening and I heard this guy who they kept calling Rosenberg

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
And I was like is that Rosenberg is that like Whoopi Goldberg

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Rosenberg like what does that mean

100
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
And then I looked

101
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Him up and I was like nah

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
The guy

103
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,024
Named Peter Rosenberg one two one two one two one two I mean listen to NPR is already pretty soft and I'm saying

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Exe works just on the black

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
This going to hurt your credit

106
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
So he's a

107
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,263
Guy born in 1979 he grew up and I grew up in Chevy Chase Maryland

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
It is heavy with a c h

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Peter says

110
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
News about 9

111
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,039
Your brother my brother's name is Nick Rosenberg Brother start staying up late making tapes

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
DJ Red Alert Marley Marl

113
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
He would start taping those

114
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Guys on the radio

115
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
At that point 1987-88 here in New York they were the only two people playing hip hop

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,655
Late at night I didn't consider myself a music person

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
I just obsessed with sports

118
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
And then at some point

119
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
I was like oh no

120
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
I love

121
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
This

122
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
It was pocket was rebellious it was interesting it was just a little

123
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
You're now to be honest

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
It's almost

125
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
Cliched when people say that like

126
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
Who would ever guess you'd be into hip-hop I'm like I don't know

127
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
I would cuz I know a million white kids weren't Hip Hop

128
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
At that time though

129
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
It was not,

130
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
It is very much something that was a badge of honor for

131
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
For both of us that we really

132
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
Really loved it I was extra cool cuz I was

133
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Superyacht

134
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
I remember one day here's a great thing

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
I traded

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Jovan

137
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
My poison taste

138
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
I had

139
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Poisons album

140
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Every Rose Has Its Thorn album

141
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
I traded that

142
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Poison tape for his

143
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
Biz Markie face

144
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
I was like

145
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
This is the best trade ever

146
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,607
It was business going off like it's a class

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Album

148
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,799
And then it ended at some point my dad went out he was coming home from work one day and he said he stopped

149
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Didn't nobody beats

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
The Wiz

151
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
He asked the guy behind the counter what like the good rap album

152
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
And I the kid actually gave him a pretty good recommendation and he bought me a

153
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,623
Called girls I got them locked by super lover Cee & Casanova rud

154
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Are you have I know

155
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
So my knowledge base was always very

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Very high very early

157
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,103
Item friend in elementary school we would talk about rap a little bit but quickly I exceeded them

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:45,503
And then I got to high school and I really took C

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
Seriously being the rap guy

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,439
What I heard the passion in Public Enemy like

161
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
That resonated with

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
I got the NWA

163
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Scared me

164
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,191
What made me interested

165
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
I just thought this is

166
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
I was like yo these guys are killing people

167
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Like this is really happy

168
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
I was really happy we going to the movies and song for I was going to the movies but to me I didn't know the line

169
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,439
Okay so Peter goes off to college mid-90s to College radio hip hop show

170
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Then as he gets out decides he wants to do this for real

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
He secretly Mina wanted to be a hip-hop DJ but

172
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
People would not take him seriously you know why kid from the suburbs

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,727
Didn't compute couldn't get on what was then called Urban radio

174
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,847
Signs of doing a year on the Howard Stern station Eastern like talk radio you know

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Whatever kind of radio

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
So he

177
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
Kept calling Hot 97 and the program director then was a white guy from Utah

178
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
I was like I'm super passionate about Hip Hop

179
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
I'm super honest

180
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
I don't think there's ever been someone

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
Who looks like me and is from my background

182
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
Who has is honest and louder voices me I really think I'll be something

183
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Any business that I don't doubt you

184
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
But

185
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
We talked about

186
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
I mean they had

187
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Token white people on various shows

188
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
But it was either your super white like Lisa G she was on the morning show for a little while after that she was super white

189
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
And that was kind of a joke

190
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Or you were Bobby konders

191
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Who does the Sunday Night Radio reggae show who you would never know he's wife

192
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Joppa Flats

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,071
Because he just talks like he's Jamaican and the only place to make music The only things out Jamaican people

194
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
So you had to be one of those

195
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
Two things where you denied your whiteness or are you just

196
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Extra like I'm going to I'm going to be the butt of the joke

197
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
White bosses have often been like you're really talented

198
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
But I don't know what people really like you like we don't

199
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
They talk to me the way you were talking right now

200
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
NSYNC if I'm able to relate

201
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
Why would our audience relate to you

202
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
If I say yes then why would my audience say yes with me because because they assume Their audience is so different than

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Send them

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,679
For a while and then 2007 Ebro Darden took over Ebro Darden in the building

205
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
How you doing sir

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
On air

207
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Ebro

208
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Black half Jewish guy from Oakland

209
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
And he got it

210
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
The hip-hop it changed it's no longer so small and simple and provincial

211
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
So we can go on pretending this is only a black and white

212
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Thanks so when Peter came to the station and gave me

213
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
Vetch AMPM deep which was my old name back then cuz I'm p

214
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
P4 Peter MD for Maryland you can call me EPMD

215
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Andy Burrows like know you're Rosenberg

216
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Ebro gave me my parents

217
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
More less

218
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
He's like the hook is that that's your name

219
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:48,287
Hot 97 Peter Rosenberg Summer Jam 2007 there's a video on on YouTube

220
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,639
Call Denny Peter Rosenberg does Summer Jam 2007

221
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
And it was my first day on the job

222
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Summer Jam is the biggest

223
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Events

224
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
Of the year at Hot 97 is this big

225
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
Show at Giants stadium all the topics

226
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
I showed up there until my first day was just walking into Giants

227
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Parking my car by myself

228
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Getting a backstage pass

229
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
And being given a mic flag that says Hot 97 the place I've always wanted to work

230
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
And being told

231
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Go up to all the famous artists or here and just getting here

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,871
And if you go back and watch that video and see how much of an ass I make of myself

233
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
I say

234
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
Itsy I think I go is this your first Summer Jam and he looks at whoever

235
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Fries with

236
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
And they both start laughing

237
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:42,047
Happy first day on the job

238
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
And I cannot believe in that respect I survived

239
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,215
This day

240
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,127
Now we survived you became the host of two shows on Hot 97 a late-night underground show

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
And also the big weekday Morning Show and

242
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Rosenberg's brand is all about real name

243
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
The real

244
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Is second in the morning is called the realness

245
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
Is late night show Sunday night to Monday morning is called real late with Peter

246
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
It's all real real real it's going to be real

247
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
Is it real cuz that's the best

248
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Essential question

249
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Can I be a real hip-hop guy

250
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Even though I'm Peter Rosenberg

251
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Suburban Maryland

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
I think you're I think you're raising interest

253
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Sandpoint

254
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
Most Outsiders rarely beak

255
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Come inside her

256
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
Peter says the key to understanding him is that he's kind of

257
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,463
One handy is the Suburban white kid from Maryland because it's going to be anything but

258
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
But on the other hand meme a big part of rosenberg's job is to go to shows and blogs and get tips from people in find

259
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
The new thing

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
So he has a stable of like

261
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
20 or 30 underground artists

262
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
For making tapes and you know trying to pass around beat

263
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
What's more inside of me than that

264
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Plus

265
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
He is like a purist

266
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
I I've always liked

267
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Are there certain pure form of hip-hop

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
And because you know in the kind of rap nerd community

269
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
They talk about certain things that are like

270
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,511
We are actively listening for the metaphors in this the intricacies of the music

271
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
They talk about boom-bap Beats

272
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Big Sean

273
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Trump lies

274
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Boom bap

275
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Spell check the hi hat

276
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,407
It's just a feeling of sound of energy

277
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
This is a lie

278
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Ali Shaheed Muhammad

279
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
A Tribe Called Quest We called him up because he is the DJ and producer for a drive

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Called Quest for Peter

281
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Tribe

282
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
There's a prototype I was obsessed with them

283
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
They were they are like that shiny red apple day to find the category in fact

284
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
I guess up until my wedding weekend best weekend of his life

285
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
I guess now would be second-best

286
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
Was when he was I was 14 you went to a tribe show it was

287
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
Everything I ever dreamed a hip-hop concert experience would be

288
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
He says he spent the whole time at the front of the stage waving his hat around that said dogs

289
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,855
D a w g s is one of lead rappers is named Fife

290
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
And I held up my dogs

291
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
So much

292
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
At the concert that eventually fight

293
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
V v v v dog acknowledge me

294
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,191
The same way I would do now if I was hosting and someone kept doing it he just gave me the hand like

295
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
I got it

296
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
You can put the hat that in that

297
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
This was a weird moment for him

298
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
I just repeated it for hip hop in general like the early 90s

299
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
This is the moment when you had

300
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Stations like Hot 97 converting to AllHipHop formats

301
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Playing

302
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
You know NWA Public Enemy Tribe Called Quest

303
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
Group C know that were suddenly attracting loads of white Suburban fan

304
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Yet if you listen to their lyrics

305
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Everybody

306
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
They were about stuff those fans could have never experienced

307
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Struggle depression

308
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Lack of opportunities in the ghetto

309
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
The fact that

310
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
You have young black teenagers

311
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Who

312
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Or living in

313
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
A society where

314
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
They're told that they will never amount

315
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
And that their lives

316
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Have no value

317
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
No worth

318
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
That to me

319
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Becomes the

320
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
The Angst in the frustration in a rage

321
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Which

322
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
Is that the embodiment of the

323
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
The music

324
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
I wanted to be a part of this

325
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
A black culture

326
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
I I felt

327
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
I've always been very interested in loving things that require defense

328
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
And Hip-Hop is definitely that

329
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
From the beginning

330
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
It was initially

331
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Shunned by black radio

332
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Being decent

333
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Then you had the whole team

334
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:51,647
Tipper Gore thing I love things like that I don't know why but I think I do always see Hip-Hop

335
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
In that sort of lie

336
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
In the way that needs defense I can we talk about

337
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Your your fracas

338
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Weather

339
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Of course

340
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
That's my paragraph to God forbid I drop dead tomorrow

341
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
Is Peter Rosenberg on Hot 97 evolve

342
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
In 2012

343
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Nicki Minaj

344
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Is this

345
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Rapper from Queens

346
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Hugely talented rap

347
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,599
American Idol

348
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
Now the face for the name and she kind of blew everyone away on this Kanye song called Monster

349
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
You know she was with

350
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Aldi's

351
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
Big rappers and Jay-Z was on the song and she blew everyone out of the water

352
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
I thought you was really good

353
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
I thought you was

354
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Unnatural and

355
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Beautiful

356
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
Lake Havasu the total package

357
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Common factor

358
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
The year before it all happened

359
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
2011 I pulled her aside at Summer Jam

360
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
I said hey I think you could be

361
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
The greatest female

362
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
Artist of all time greatest female rap artist

363
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
And I just want you to know that

364
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
In thinking that

365
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
I'm going to hold you to a high standard so I probably will say things

366
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,383
You said all of that in a really quick moment to it was really Brave she probably wouldn't remember

367
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,735
What happened to remember that if someone said that I and I said I think you could be the greatest

368
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
She had all this

369
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Underground credit right

370
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
And then how did you spend that credit well she started making

371
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Popular and popular record

372
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
Culminating in the following song

373
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
If you are me

374
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
You've not been able to get out of your head

375
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
For a week

376
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
She made this song called Starship

377
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,079
Let's go to the beach each let's go

378
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Starships is a blatant pop

379
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
Lowest common denominators I didn't I didn't like

380
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
The song you listen to that song and you cannot tell that it's not

381
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
A song by

382
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
Katy Perry or pink or it could be anyone

383
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
So all of a sudden who is the underground crab

384
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Cop

385
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
But Peter Rosenberg

386
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
Sometimes I got several mornings for his segment called the realness

387
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,175
He would get on there and play I play a clip of Starship

388
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Hardcore hip-hop

389
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Stop it

390
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,751
There is a real question being asked at the center of this which is

391
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
What is this music

392
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Where the boundaries are

393
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,151
And also is this where hip hop is going

394
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
Is it just let me cash in and just

395
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,855
Follow the trends of what white music is doing it like you felt betrayed as it as a music

396
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,463
Yeah I felt like, and we just sent in the moment it felt like

397
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,583
You're at your hip hop star why would you why would you do this this is and this is not for us

398
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Encore hip hop artists

399
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Make pop song

400
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
It upsets me because

401
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
It's a bacon be a moment that blurs and messes up

402
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Hip Hop

403
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
This song right here Stars

404
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Is literally

405
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
One of the most sellout song

406
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
In the Papas

407
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
Just put that comment in a tiny bit more context vs

408
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
No mention of course the history right

409
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
That's so many forms of popular music have been invented by black people co-opted by white people jazz blues rock

410
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
We all know the story

411
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
According to Franny Kelly

412
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,799
One of the hosts of a podcast called microphone check

413
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Podcast from NPR music 2013 was the first year that no black artist had a number one song

414
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Since 1958

415
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
Since they started the Hot 100 charts this the first year where no black artist makes a number 1 at this may be a blip

416
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
May not be

417
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
What's clear is that there is a new force in town

418
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,047
A style of music called EDM.

419
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Is a meaningless

420
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
Acronym that stands for electronic dance music

421
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
And it's like you know then

422
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,199
It's sort of amalgam of Cindy Dancy techno a Euro poppy stuff and

423
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
It is taking over

424
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
What happened with EDM was just so glaring and

425
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Fast

426
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
And then to see that sort of start to creep into hip-hop with Gary for people

427
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
The idiom is

428
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,559
The style of music that's meant to work on any dance floor with any crap

429
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
So that way it's like a music without history

430
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,935
On purpose a lot of the criticism of like EDM is that

431
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,775
It is all about my it is the corporatization of

432
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Play genre with along

433
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,663
History so in some ways I think the root of the protest

434
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Is

435
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Don't

436
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Dell

437
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Our stuff

438
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
To the highest bidder

439
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Silicon texting app

440
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
After sell out song

441
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
In hip hop history

442
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
After Peter trash talks Nicki Minaj Starships

443
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
We arrived at that Year's Summer Jam 2012

444
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
And that your Nicki Minaj was going to be one of the big headliner

445
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Plan was part of

446
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Perform on the main stage

447
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Inside giant snake

448
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
But outside the stadium in the parking lot

449
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,223
Earlier in the day there's the festival stage which is where the underground backpack kids Hangout

450
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
And that's Rosenberg

451
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Zone

452
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
So he's introducing the axe on that stage

453
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,671
Before I get to the real hip hop of the day

454
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,535
Cuz I see the real hip-hop had sprinkled in here I see him I said

455
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
In trying to Hype up the

456
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
This Crowd

457
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
Who sings Starships later I'm not talking to you all right now

458
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Crab Pina Gose

459
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
A little bit like there's a cheer

460
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Nothing crazy though just a regular chair sound like

461
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
I didn't realize a bomb was

462
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
I forgot

463
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
That Not only was the festival stage lives

464
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Streaming

465
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
What is live-streaming on her web

466
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
And her

467
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:23,072
Poor fan barbs as they're known are 13 year old girls

468
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
And when they see Peter say that Big O

469
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Wild

470
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
And they

471
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Go out on the internet

472
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
Who is this Rosenberg guy what is his deal he says with a got back to Nikki and her

473
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Before she went on stage before she went on stage

474
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
So then there's this tax date conversation

475
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,416
Roseburg basically as soon as he gets off stage his boss my boss comes out pokes his head around the curtain and goes

476
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Did you say something about Nicki Minaj

477
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
I was like remember

478
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
I'm like oh yeah I did

479
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
And he's like

480
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah what you just cancel the show

481
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
So she's not coming

482
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
And I was like

483
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
I was like oh

484
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
And I looked at my phone and I go to Twitter

485
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Sitting on the stage

486
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Is the crowds all out

487
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Giants stadium

488
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
And I look on Twitter

489
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
And I go to Trenton

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
And on the main Trend page

491
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
It just says Peter has

492
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
And I was like

493
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
Oh wow

494
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
This is

495
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,536
Is this Sunday afternoon at like 5 and

496
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
I would like

497
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Third most trending thing in the world

498
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
I was just

499
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Watching

500
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
My name

501
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
Get bigger in a moment

502
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,224
What is a big drama that happened in New York I was reading just my name over and over and over again

503
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,392
Peter Rosenberg all these people saying I don't know who this guy is but he's dissing my favorite artist

504
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
Disappointed and I don't understand how she

505
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
I was reading who is this guy

506
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,912
Real hip hop one man say one thing

507
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,264
And everybody stop he must have got some serious cred from this

508
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,848
Not only was his name getting out there but it was getting out there as I'm the GateKeeper

509
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm the defender and the defender of the real

510
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
The real

511
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
I couldn't appreciate it

512
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
At first because I didn't know if I was maybe going to get fired for messing up Summer Jam because Nikki's and beefing with the station

513
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,696
Come on your state or even say something

514
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
She's calling in you no matter the station

515
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Papa John's

516
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
Busta Rhymes get some balls trying to broker a deal on Master Flex gets involved they're trying to reach a daytime

517
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
It becomes a months-long process

518
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Nut

519
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
If they say unanimous

520
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
Sleep know you were wrong about that song this is

521
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
Is our song We included in our

522
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Map of what's going on

523
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Stop trying to draw the map

524
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
What do you say that in your inside you

525
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
I think my gut reaction

526
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,256
You know nothing you don't draw the map

527
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
You need people like us

528
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
To draw the map

529
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Or there's nothing

530
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
What is that

531
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,216
If if we don't get to determine certain things

532
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,360
Who does we should leave that to the crazed thirteen-year-old who may not even like this artist in 2 years

533
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Other Woman

534
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Hearing that

535
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
Sprained ankle again this idea that

536
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Young girls with your Starships

537
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
And say oh

538
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
That's Hip Hop

539
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,464
That's what I want to hear that's what I'm to judge everything against you wildly unfair

540
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,024
To the intelligence of young girls

541
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,120
Freddy says they can figure out the difference between hip hop and pop they don't need help

542
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,960
And furthermore when he chose Starships to single out

543
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
It felt

544
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
Revealing of another

545
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
Layer to this debate that

546
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
People want

547
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Out loud

548
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:51,200
Which is it when people refer to things as quote real hip hop

549
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Usually code for aggressive

550
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Street

551
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
Masculine

552
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Where is when they say pop

553
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
That's usually code for

554
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Feminine

555
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Which is a perversion of

556
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
What's the music

557
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
And so there is this idea that

558
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
You know people make

559
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Songs for the ladies

560
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,424
Which implies that all the rest of them are songs that we can't hear or God forbid understand

561
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Okay so all of this

562
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,384
Swirling around months go by and then fast forward to the week before the next Summer Jam this is 2014

563
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
2013 - 2013

564
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
Feud is still going to year later

565
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
But Grenadier Nikki decide

566
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
It's time to settle

567
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Maybe because she wanted to perform at that you

568
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Your summer Jan are so

569
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Nicki Minaj

570
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Radio station

571
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
She come to the station

572
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Before

573
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Summer Jam to make herpes

574
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
And they do this whole interview with Rosenberg and Nicki Minaj and Ebro the boss is moderating

575
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
On the air on the rosenbergs

576
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
Where would you like this interview to go

577
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
I don't know I'm excited I'm excited to see Nikki because

578
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,648
It's very odd to have some of that you don't know very well who's become like such a fixture in your life like

579
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
I've always wondered I was always like I wonder if Nikki knows that she's come up

580
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
Everyday of my life

581
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
For 350 days like

582
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,448
Point that where Starship got played on my wedding and it was like the biggest deal at my wedding

583
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Starship playing at my way

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
After some opening remarks

585
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Peter basic

586
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
I am sorry that things went as left as they did

587
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
I never had ill feelings about you as a human being ever

588
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,528
Mac says I have nothing against you as a person be on my

589
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Sort of distaste for that song

590
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
That's cool

591
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
As water under the bridge

592
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Do you mean that

593
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Yeah

594
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
She then goes out of her way to apologize to

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
To her fans for

596
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
Skipping out on the gig

597
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Danny Glover

598
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
You know what like I get it like

599
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
That's what you do

600
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
I guess

601
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Tumi

602
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
I just don't know your resume

603
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
You know I'm saying so

604
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
I never found you funny I never found you entertaining another

605
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
You smart

606
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
I just found you annoying

607
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Because

608
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
You know

609
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
I grew up in New York

610
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
I've gone out on Hot 97 like

611
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
I know Angie and I know Flags

612
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Mr Stephen Wallace

613
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
People

614
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Whether they like me or whether or not

615
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
We get along I just know their resume

616
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
But like with you I was just like

617
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Who are you

618
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
I don't recognize you as an authority on WhatsApp sent

619
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Tammy

620
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
You don't have enough

621
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Of a resume

622
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
To make those comments

623
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Who are you to tell me what to do

624
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
What people on Tinder

625
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
Is Dan is that when I

626
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
Can't when I was doing this

627
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
I took a lot

628
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Men

629
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,624
She was like my whole career there just been random men

630
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
Who have liked being in no position to stop me

631
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
And tell me why I'm not good enough

632
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
I just did I just don't want a lot of

633
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
From guys and here you are

634
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
I don't know you

635
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
You just some random man

636
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,496
Manny bro jumps any kind of jokingly trying to lighten the mood goes and you

637
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,104
I didn't even say that

638
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
And then she jumped into goes

639
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
No no no

640
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
That to

641
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
Being white also struck a chord with me if I'm being honest

642
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Because

643
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
I was like young he's on a

644
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
Black

645
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Station

646
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Justin Black

647
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
People like I don't

648
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
I don't I just didn't like

649
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Did you get back to that idea

650
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Category ideas

651
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Like

652
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,728
When you don't have that like set list of criteria to help you figure out who's in and who's out

653
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,056
It's all about a gut feeling and Nicki Minaj that moment

654
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,688
Have a white guy from the suburbs tell her a black woman from Queens that she's not hip-hop enough

655
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,320
Spell wrong then Ali Shaheed Muhammad from Tribe Called Quest put it this way

656
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Maybe feels wrong but maybe this is actually Evolution 40 years into it that's what it supposed to be at some point we're all going

657
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
To be so far removed from

658
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
The origin that no one would think

659
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Qualify

660
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
Really but if you're going to be the person to

661
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Querida

662
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
The torch I guess

663
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
To be the gatekeeper fan at some point what qualifies you

664
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
It's your heart

665
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Miss that feeling

666
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
You could be Bill Gates kid

667
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
Still understand the struggle enough to be like y'all

668
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
I'm riding with that

669
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
And I want to fight for that

670
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
I was like yo

671
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Black

672
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Station

673
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Justin Black

674
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
People like I don't

675
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
I don't I just didn't like the

676
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
The feel of it

677
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,168
Who am I going to diss if not black people I want a hip hop station I have to just black people sometimes

678
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Watch your mouth shut and McLemore

679
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Roseburg to this day takes

680
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Reddit for her

681
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
Saying my next project is going to be at

682
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,472
Hardcore hip-hop albums albums awesome you will see me take lots of credit for it. Absolutely

683
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
She called me the other day

684
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
And I was

685
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Half a sleeve

686
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
And she like

687
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Hello

688
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
I know you're thinking

689
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:15,040
Why is this b**** called and I was like not at all what's going on

690
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
You better do something and the amazing thing was she wanted to ask me an opinion.

691
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
Something and it makes me feel ultimately super special

692
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,744
So we asked Peter like so what does that mean like if you are now a gay

693
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Are you white guy from

694
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Suburban Maryland

695
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Very commercial radio

696
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
What does that mean for hip hop

697
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
Let me know hip-hop has by default been co-opted cuz like

698
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:37,312
I hear you are I don't know I mean I feel like hip hop is in a better place now

699
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Then before I

700
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Started

701
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Doing this

702
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
I would break it down on paper

703
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,248
Let me tell you where we were when I started my underground show in 2000's

704
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
And let me tell you what I think we are in 2014

705
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,672
Let me show you how many those artists I broke and supported and worked hard with and talk to the label about

706
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Push

707
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
How many I had involved with I think you see a really high percent

708
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
So that was part of his answer

709
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
We asked Andrew the same questions,

710
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
I mean

711
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
I look I

712
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
I don't think that hip-hop

713
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Is Dad there was some

714
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Quote on

715
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Frank Zappa

716
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Thanks Ed

00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Jazz isn't dead it just smells funny

718
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Like

719
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,248
I don't think hip hop group what group

720
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,648
I think Hip Hop isn't dead

721
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
It always smells a little

722
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
Huge snakes to Andrew Marantz and The New Yorker magazine for letting us borrow Andrew for a Beat

723
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:49,504
Definitely check out his story in the New Yorker magazine is called old school it's

724
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,832
Great story goes into way more detail the week get into here

725
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:58,208
Also a big thanks to Franny Kelly and Ali Shaheed Muhammad

00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,288
So lest you think that like hip-hop is arrived at this new

729
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Quote post

730
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Racial

731
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,200
Situation when we were like maybe Bears thinking out loud

732
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
With Peter and he was like

733
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
No way no

734
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
God is one thing I could demand

735
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,136
That are drained is peace it would be this statement right here

736
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,696
Nothing has driven me more crazy over the

737
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
The course of my time in hip hop

738
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Then why people come up to me and go

739
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
You know and it used to be really bad when he first came out

740
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
You know

741
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
Eminem is just so talented

742
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
I don't even listen to Hip Hop

743
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
But

744
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Eminem

745
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
I mean now he's good

746
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
If you don't listen to Hip Hop

747
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,320
Why the hell should I care what your thoughts on Eminem are and how do you know that he's good you know that he's white

748
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
You know that he's white

749
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
Is Eminem good

750
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes it just so happens that he's as good as you

751
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
As your guessing he is

752
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
Random you don't even know that

753
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:11,424
Eminem could be any could have been one of the dude from Milli Vanilli and you would have thought it was great

754
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,240
Drive me nuts in so anytime I think about

755
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,080
Over post-racial just look at what Eminem concerts look like and what

756
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
The sales look like

757
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
And you can be instantly reminded

758
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
The even though Eminem

759
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Has

760
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
No experience that

761
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
Average Suburban White America could ever identified

762
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
I mean culturally the experience you went through

763
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Is much more common

764
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
With someone went with

765
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
Went through a black struggle than any sort of

766
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
Regular white Suburban life

767
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,816
I'm just the guy who came up in a rough situation

768
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
In A Million Ways

769
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Was the odd man out all the time

770
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Never had anything

771
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
And then makes it

772
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
And all of a sudden the fact that people like home

773
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
I so identify with

774
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,920
What is it why do I identify with a guy who's from a trailer park

775
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
From a history of drug abuse who raps about things that

776
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
I'd be terrified of if a black man was saying

777
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:05,184
Identify with him so much and then Eminem cuz he's amazing

778
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Raps about the same thing

779
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
He doesn't song called Dear White America retails them

780
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
You're an idiot

781
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
You let your kids listen to me

782
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,192
But you would like to listen anyone else just cuz I'm white you're an idiot and they love it

783
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Unbelievable

784
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,616
