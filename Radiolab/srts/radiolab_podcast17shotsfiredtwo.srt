1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Before we get going

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,192
Earthquake warning this podcast contains some descriptions of graphic violence

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,496
And also some strong language

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
Be warned

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
Weight units

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,392
Radiolab WNYC

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,768
Look at

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
It's hard to

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,632
Kill another human being anymore right we are fangs have retreated

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Hands are weak

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
But

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496
Possibility kill each other weave

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
Games and ability to read each other's tone of voice

14
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
And facial expression

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:54,528
And often what's missing in these interactions is one side of that equation

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Whether it's the police not seeing somebody because of running through an alley with their guns drawn and

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
And start or shining a flashlight in someone's face where that person can't

18
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
Can see the officers expression there's some mask with some breakdown in that in that equation that makes

19
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
Handicap sauce from a normal human interaction

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Hey I'm Jared home run by Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and today we are once again taking a deep dive in

21
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Into Tampa Bay Times Reporter Ben Montgomery's mountain of data about police shootings in Florida

22
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Soap to refresh your memory from with try to account for every single police shooting from January 1st of two

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
2009 to

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
December 31st of 2014 and we just remind you ban in his team at the Tampa Bay Times collected data from

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
828

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Police shootings

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
And there's all kinds of stories that you can tell about the status last week we looked at police training and racing

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
And racism

29
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
And obviously there's so much more they can and should be said about all of that but this week we're going to go in a very different

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,536
Direction maybe Matt you just want want to set this up for us

31
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,424
Plays out this this idea that then just mentioned that this is her Communication Breakdown it happens

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
And it doesn't in a very particular way

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Because when one of these cases

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,848
Comes before a court the court more often then I will only look at the moment

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
That the cop involved in the shooting

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
Pull the trigger you don't consider any other moment it's only the objective facts on the ground of the moment the officer

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Applies Force

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,928
So the thing that we found compelling about this story is that

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
In this case you can actually see

40
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
And kind of a rare instance

41
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,376
You can lie cats you can step in and see all the little moments that lead up to that moment

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
You realize how

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Complicated

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
These interactions get

45
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Citizen to give a story to story about white couple

46
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
Andrea and Rick Sheldon

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
And rushing to start story with Rick

48
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
So on one of my trips to Florida Ben and I drove to the northeast corner of the state of

49
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm your Jacksonville to Rick's place

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
It's sort of like the the Wilds of Florida if they're guilty

51
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Wild Big Bird back there

52
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
What on whenever you're going to property pretty much a little bit of everything to collect rainwater in barrels he's got potatoes tomatoes

53
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
Squash eat organic Gardens Ducks goats animals turkey

54
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Turkeys

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,576
Oh my God oh my God

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
Aetna stop in this replace battery

57
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
Eventually we all sit down lyrics living room Rick

58
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Sat cross-legged on the couch Rick I was just wondering if we could I pull up a chair across from him we can talk about your case

59
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
But even backing up before everything happened

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Please tell me about about your about your wife

61
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480

Panda

64
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
We hit it off

65
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
Straight from the get-go where'd you where'd you guys meet

66
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Tradewinds Lounge

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
Downtown st. Augustine

68
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Other Bar downtown look like

Osaka thing

73
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Profit to make the first move

74
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
I know we can make the same movie same time

75
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
And I can remember telling her you know

76
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
We have a live burn tomorrow Rick was in training to be a firefighter at the academy one of her last events

77
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
And that I'd call her whenever I got done

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
And are we going to have dinner

79
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
She's like

80
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Now you're not going to call me

81
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
You just don't come over like I'm going to be stinky

82
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Tonight

83
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
Cuz I know that if you go back to your place you're going to pass out tired

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
And I never see you again

85
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:57,471
So you just going to come over here and take a shower and I showed up I ate dinner Batman

86
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
So that was a date number one Rick says it is connected and so the date

00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Everybody year she moved down here and then to him got married nursing school

88
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,391
Rick eventually became a firefighter for Jackson Fire Rescue

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
Jump Ahead to the night in question can you just like

90
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Back up to Lake

91
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743

We woke up extra early

00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Wait what day is it

95
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
April 15th

96
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
2012

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Yeah

98
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
We were in our cabin in Georgia

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,663
Getting it ready getting it all set up and whatnot is going to be a retirement place

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Dammit

101
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Backup

102
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Came home

103
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Long drive

104
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Long hot Drive

105
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
We got home

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,463
Start unpacking the car a little bit start doing a little bit of the Sentinel are doing well. Chat and talk about dinner

107
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Having a couple of drinks

108
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
But not what happened after that

109
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Now now

110
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
I'm just kind of

111
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
Start getting grumpy at each other and

112
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Getting

113
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Grumpy

114
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,335
Now we talked about this for a while I'm just wondering if you can remember

115
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,919
Just kind of any detail of what you guys were talking about

116
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,527
And Rick didn't want to get into it I'd rather not make statement about that right now

117
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,367
About the conversation

118
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
All we can say according the police report is that Rick and Andy got into this screaming match and Rick says that he felt himself

119
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,399
Shortness of breath chest pain loss of concentration inability to think

120
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Rick says he had problems with PTSD

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Quite a while

122
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Because back to his former job as a paramedic

123
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
I can't take this

124
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
I need to walk away

125
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,527
Grab the bottle out of the refrigerator and I got in my truck and I went I was like okay I'm just going to go fishing

126
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,623
Drove down this dirt road for about 5 miles to the big pond down there

127
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,487
By the pond I was stuck his truck is stuck in the mud I was axle deep

128
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
Tell him you'll meet up his bottle of tequila and he starts drinking

129
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
He keeps drinking eventually pop some pills sleeping pills

130
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,311
Next thing I remember was him I remember having problems I remember being upset and remember

131
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Having my

132
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
PTSD shadowsocks

133
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Call my boss, and I need some help

135
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903

Oh you thought you were suicidal in that moment I thought I was losing it

00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
You don't want to look in the shed

143
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639

00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
Did he say anything to you

00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
I don't remember the conversation

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Okay

Who the hell is firing shots

180
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
That's Rick trying to figure out what happened

181
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Heavy D

182
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,927
When we come back we look at what happened during that phone call and the tragic game of telephone that led to it

183
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Stay with us

184
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

189
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show and I've requested

190
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

191
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
That what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times

192
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Did something

193
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

194
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

195
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

196
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

197
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

198
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495

00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,407
And that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

201
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,535
This is Radiolab to get back to our story

202
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Rick Sheldon and a deputy were on the phone shots were fired in the background

203
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
And then the line went dead

204
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
We pick back up with our reporter Matt kielty

205
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
2

206
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,615
What we know is while the deputy was talking to Rick

207
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
The other officers that were with the deputy

208
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
I have gone ahead

209
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
And going up to the house

210
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Rick's wife Andy

211
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
Heard something came out of the house with a shotgun

212
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,695
The deputies say that she pointed a shotgun at one of the deputies

213
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
They open fire and she was shot and killed

214
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
They're on the front porch did they say did they identify themselves

215
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,007
Ben and I were able to get all of the police dispatch recordings

216
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
From that night

217
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
And if you go to these recordings what you hear is

218
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,759
Discreetly drawn-out version of what Ben was talking about at the top of the story

219
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
The disconnected happens between

220
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
The deputies and the dispatchers and what they're thinking hearing and seeing what's actually

221
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Happening

222
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
So if you rewind about 40 minutes before that shooting the first thing that happened was Rick called his boss

223
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
We don't know exactly what was said in that phone call because it wasn't recorded but what we do know is that Rick's boss left

224
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,895
Conversation bleeding a trick might be possibly suicidal that there been a fight at the house that Rick

225
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
I had some guns with minutes truck cuz it's freaking idiot on camping and that there was a gun back at the house

226
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
But anyways the first thing that happened after that call is Rick boss his fire chief calls fire.

227
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
Dispatch calls a sheriff dispatcher who raped in another

228
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Daltrey dispatches get on the line what we can figure out what's going on

229
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
Sheriff dispatch number 3 he's just like

230
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
Information

231
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Right around the time that dispatch number three is making that call somehow or another Sheriff's dispatcher afford dispatcher

232
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
How to call for a welfare check

233
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Is it he is in the woods that has a handgun

234
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
But then things start to get more complicated because when dispatcher number three gets ahold of Rick's pasta fire cheese

235
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Details what is issue with the deal

236
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
I said she come out you're hiding in the woods my wife chasing me with a gun just couldn't take it anymore

237
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
Some of it back but things are emotions then

238
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
Number for relays to teach story to the deputies in route or a handgun but it's chasing the male who took

239
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Medication hallucinating what's going on

240
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
Is chasing him

241
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Which Rick said he said but you said there was a gun in the house that's it

242
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
In the woods

243
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
I didn't say anything like that

244
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Clarification male hath is hiding from his wife who signal zero with a handgun in fear of her

245
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
I'm trying to get more 1043

246
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Howard's of miscommunication Because by the time the police show up at this house for what is normally a welfare check

247
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Now she has a shotgun inside the house

248
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
I'm off into the woods what's that address also armed deputies they

249
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
So damn dark out here with blacked-out walk

250
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Pull up in a blackout

251
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,015
Place to gather their flashlights and I start walking down this road

252
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
Rick's place in one of their views even puts on these night vision goggles because they think this woman is chased her husband in the woods

253
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Supposably he's in the Woods by his house

254
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Spell

255
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Working out to

256
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
Start walking down the straight road towards Creek Place

257
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
The neighbors dog gets freaked out eventually

258
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
Vi at least get to the edge of Rick's driveway

259
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Detective around here about 40 minutes after Rick

260
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
Made that first called was boss the Ricky said call from the deputy

261
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Hi there how are you doing

262
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Your wife

263
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,543
No I took all the guns with mags

264
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Okay

265
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Okay

266
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
Domestic dispute

267
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
But as the deputy is talking to Rick for the deputies start walking up

268
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Rick's driveway so they get up to the house two of them walk up onto the porch one of the Moon looks through the bed

269
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
Bedroom window where Andy is and she has no reason to believe the police or anywhere on her property

270
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,359
Sleep a presumably she heard a noise grab the shotgun in the house and came outside

271
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,479
In This Moment all we really have to go on is what the cop said they saw

272
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
Which is Andy came out through the front door wearing nothing but her underwear

273
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Holding shotgun

274
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,743
Cop saved a identified themselves they were her screaming at her to drop the gun

275
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
They say that Andy took a step forward

276
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Level 2 shotgun against your shoulder

277
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
And then

278
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,495
They open fire if I 24 Shots to hit Andy at least 8 times

279
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
She fell to the porch

280
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
Some of the peace officers rescuer begin performing first aid

281
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
Let me see the radio for an ambulance and paramedics showed up

282
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
And pronounce and eat at the same

283
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
At this point you have any idea what's happening now

284
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Medical

285
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
I never realized I needed to

286
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Snap out wake up

287
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
Get my ass in gear and find out what's going on

288
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Buttrick

289
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
Check the stock and so it took three hours for them to the cops figure out where he was Santa Cruz over to meet him Joe the ground crew came over and

290
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,639
Pick me up handcuffed me and put me in the back of a four-wheel drive pickup truck and took me to headquarters

291
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
I got another car brought me to headquarters put me in a room typical interrogation type room

292
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
And then I start noticing that they were drum

293
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Being very very friendly

294
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,023
Some people are saying something about you oh my my camping equipment in the truck I remember them

295
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Authorizing me to have a cigarette

296
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
And the broom

297
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
And then we pretty much went through the same questioning that we've gone through so far and at which time they

298
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Inform me that

299
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
They had a

300
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Come out to the house

301
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
Check on Maddie & Tae

302
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
She's come to the door and there was an altercation and they shot and killed her

303
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
That was the breaking news

304
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Pretty much

305
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
When you hear something like that I mean

306
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
I can't even fathom

307
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
How you respond to some news like that

308
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
I still care

309
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Responding to it

310
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Did you say anything to him

311
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Am I under arrest

312
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Handcuffs off me

313
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
How long did it take him to

314
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
To uncuff you

315
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
I don't remember

316
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
We say anything to him while you're still cuff

317
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
From that moment on I pretty much just

318
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
But what do you say whenever somebody looks at me and says your wife is dead

319
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Richard Gilder

320
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,271
That that the absolute implosion of your mind just

321
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,023
The Searing pain the explosive feeling the need

322
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Do I get angry do I get

323
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Sad Dua

324
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
Break down and cry why do I fall apart Dua

325
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
Hold it together long enough where I can figure out what the

326
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
He'll just happen

327
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
What

328
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
You did what

329
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,503
You went out at my house in the middle night

330
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
And you shot my wife

331
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
I mean

332
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
How do you respond to that to this day I'm still

333
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
Sx720 50 times a day answer myself

334
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
Radar map

335
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Mimi

336
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Stampy Cat

337
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
No

338
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
Did you see her at all after the shooting yes

339
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Two weeks afterwards

340
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Where was that

341
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
And funeral home

342
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
One of the funeral home and down

343
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Simon Peter Billingsley

344
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
And reach down the kisser and

345
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
Felt the edge of what I thought was a casket move

346
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
I was at time that realize that she was on a cardboard box

347
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
If it had

348
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
Braille on it to make it look pretty

349
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Did you say anything to her

350
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
I am

351
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
Tell her that we really need to do something about her hair because it was a mess

352
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
And the rest of what I said to her is between me and her

353
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Yeah of course

354
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
