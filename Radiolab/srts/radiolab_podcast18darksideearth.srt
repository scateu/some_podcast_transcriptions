We were just talking to just named Mark vanderhei

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
Was he to show us where he was

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704

We should explain Lexi this is one of the weirdest things that ever happened to us

44
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Couple weeks ago we got to talk

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
Does astronaut Mark vandehei while he was in the International Space Station

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Apparently each

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Astronaut

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416

00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Can make one request

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
You talk to an Earthling of

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Their choice

52
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
And

53
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
For some reason each other

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
I really enjoyed your program

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
Like we actually got initially contacted by NASA

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,664
Dial in the mission control at a certain time and we did then they then connected us to him 200 miles up

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
And we could see him

58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Honor iPad

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Jesus in space

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
And so we spent

61
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
I know like an hour the enchanted hour

62
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
Talking to him asking him questions about what's it like

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
The mostly looking over his

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Is shoulder

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Back of the Earth

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
He invited us to the store place

67
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
So they have on the spaceship

68
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
If it's a room with giant Windows looking right down at the ER

69
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
Straight down

70
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Are we just passed over the southern edge of

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Australia

72
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
At that time it was night time in Australia

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Pool of black

74
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
No Contours

75
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
No edges

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
I'll check to see how long it'll be before the sun shining earth below us

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Open up for the shutters

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Horizon

79
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
He pointed

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Out the window at this band of light

81
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Did it just appear in the

82
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,832
Cats with sun coming over horizon horizon the Earth

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Turn the blasted out in the school like a few minutes later

84
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
Change really fast the Earth just lit up all the lights on.

85
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
Yeah cuz they're going 17,000 miles an hour when you're going that fast

86
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Sunrises basically instantaneous

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
As we were talking we zoomed over Australia over the Pacific

88
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
North America facts

89
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Within just

90
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Couple minutes felt like

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
Scenery out his window went from Rocky Mountains to somewhere near New York

92
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Then we are over the Atlantic

93
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
The interplay of the sun and the ocean is where I need to be

94
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Shimmering patterns on the ocean and

95
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Swirling Cloud masses

96
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,343
And as we were screaming across the face of the Earth

97
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,207
You know we're asking all these mundane questions like how do you eat rice in space and things like that

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
But at a certain point

99
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
We

100
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
We asked him

101
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
When you first got up there what was most

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Surprising to you

103
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
And he started talking about the Earth's

104
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Atmosphere

105
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
I think you saw my first impression when I sat up here is that

106
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Neptune layer of atmosphere

107
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
He says that it's

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Funny to him

109
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Now that he's been up there for

110
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
To understand how close we all are

111
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Two deep space

112
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
People who live on earth

113
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Parole action

114
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
Under a very skinny protective wrapper

115
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
It's been described as

116
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Less

117
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
Thick than the skin of an apple around

118
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
All of us

119
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Just a few miles

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
From the dark

121
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
It makes for some

122
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
States that mean

123
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Incredibly thin

124
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,207
Intensely

125
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,863
Very very isolated

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
He says when he looks down at the Earth and he sees that

127
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Thin layer

128
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
It separates us from space and all the Blackness around it

129
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
He feels

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Protective

131
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,607
Which going to share that because it was just this weird thing that happened to us randomly just a few weeks back

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Well actually

133
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
As cool as that was

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
It's an order

135
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
To one another

136
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Yes who wasn't delish

137
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
Definitely

138
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
Faintest idea who that was it more of a official formal

139
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Wright's arteritis

140
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Search for the Restless podcast going to play you another astronaut story that we ended up taking on stage as part of our in the dark tour

141
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
For which is

142
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
Figures of Altima 2012 I think

143
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
About 20 cities list

144
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
Particular recording happen in Seattle I believe

145
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
I don't know

146
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
So here it is

147
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Silver final segment

148
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
We would think through this show we thought you know who would have a really in

149
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Chrissy perspective

150
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Maybe somebody who works

151
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
MMA

152
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Rich

153
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Dark environment astronauts

154
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
So we called up

155
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Talk to master

156
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
We connected our little studio in New York

157
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
To theirs

158
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
Studio DC

159
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
To talk to an astronaut but he's a little late

160
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
And I use the funny thing

161
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
When you are on hold

162
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
With NASA

163
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
This is literally what you

164
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Has a blast off filter

165
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,367
This is literally the case you. 1-800 Nassar whatever and they just

166
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
The go to the Moon music

167
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Oh

168
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Hello

169
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
I hear someone breathing.

170
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
It's probably I'm breathing

171
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,127
So this is our guy Dave wolf is his name me the NASA astronaut have been since 1990

172
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
Over 20 years he wasn't really sure why we had called him

173
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
What what's our topic here

174
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
So explain to him that you know what we're doing the show called in the dark

175
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Are we going to get on stage

176
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Very nice folks

177
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
Do you have any stories that relate

178
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
And right off the bat

179
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,071
You've triggered an interesting Darkness story I have

180
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
That's why we calling you up

181
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
Yeah okay you're at your taping and you're ready

182
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
Yep darkness is an interesting theme in space

183
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Because there is nowhere

184
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Where the

185
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,199
Contrast between light and dark is any more extreme

186
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Davidson doesn't

187
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
The space waxy says there have been times

188
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
We sister out there floating in space next to

189
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
The Craft

190
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
And maybe the

191
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Tilt a little bit

192
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
And wing

193
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Blocks light

194
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
The Sun or the Moon

195
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
And it creates a shadow

196
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
He said the darkness

197
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
That shadow

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
Is blacker than any black you thought it could be

199
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Now they're in Space the shadow has no light in it

200
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:51,103
There's not reflected light from dust in the air the Earth around you or clouds

201
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Pure app

202
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
And

203
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
You can reach

204
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Into a shadow so deep

205
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
So black

206
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
At your arm can appear to disappear

207
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Wow right in front of your face

208
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
When your head is in the bright light

209
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
And your arm is in his

210
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Gaps of Darkness

211
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
And she's gone like

212
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
And cut off

213
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
But I do want to tell you

214
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
An experience I had

215
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
You're my first

216
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Spacewalk

217
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
Play 897 I have this

218
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Experience not gay

219
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
It was from a Russian spacecraft

220
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
Your mic might remember the mirror

221
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Yeah sure face craft

222
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Today was up there he was

223
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
The two Russian cosmonauts

224
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
Kent and Anatoly soloviev

225
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
They were suited up

226
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
And getting ready to make their first

227
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Walking to stay

228
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
For his first one

229
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
And we did all the preparations

230
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
How to get the suits ready

231
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
And more in the airlock

232
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
And

233
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Door open and they floated out we

234
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
Flipkart others on outside he and entally gently float to the worksite

235
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
And it was dark out and dark up in space means you're on the nights

236
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Side of the Earth in the shadow of the earth and there were no external lights on this phone

237
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Spacecraft this was really really dark and we were over the ocean and at night that basically means

238
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
She'll see the Earth you don't see it at all

239
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Not at all when it's up a moonless night you don't see the Earth in fact all it might look

240
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
Look like to you is the absence of stars

241
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
I want you to imagine Assuming he's up there in this darkness and the Earth with all of us

242
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
What's on it somewhere Far Far Below him you can't see it

243
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,079
All the while and this is really important what happens next he is

244
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Shooting through space he's rocketing across the dark shadow of the Earth at 5 miles a second that is 6

245
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
15 *

246
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Speed the world moving right now cuz we are on the Earth

247
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
He said that he didn't steal any of that it just felt like he was

248
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
Bended in this Cocoon of black floating gently you thought no problem

249
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,447
It was just me and the spacecraft and blackness

250
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
And suddenly

251
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Blazing White

252
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Grafton from Below

253
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
At the Sunrise which normally happens here on Earth very very slowly calmly at that speed up there the Sun

254
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
Screaming from the Eastern edge of the Earth straight across the Earth lights up everything is seconds

255
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
Below me suddenly I can look down 200 miles and see that we're

256
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Removing at 5 miles per second

257
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
I clutched Andres handrails like there's no tomorrow white-knuckled in my space suit gloves

258
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Because I suddenly had this enormous sense of height and speed

259
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
Like if you're standing comfortably on the ground and and then some someone just flips on the lights suddenly and you realize

260
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,799
Actually I'm not on the ground I am on a 400000 foot ladder

261
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Crazier still in that Sunrise moment the temperature also increase

262
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
Reese's by upwards of 400° in the moment in the moment

263
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
Stream thing I've ever heard are conditioned or whatever are you you are we are totally depend

264
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Combat space suit

265
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
But the colors

266
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
What you're seeing on that Earth

267
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Is so spectacular

268
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
The greens and blues and the

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Delicate pastel light colors

270
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
Contrast the brights

271
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
Are you just are present

272
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,063
Anything I've ever seen other than up in space

273
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
David is Russian buddy and totally

274
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
There after 4 hours

275
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
Doing repairs on the ship so they are

276
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,047
Is there speed they're going in and out and in and out of these days and nights

277
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
So it's

278
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
90 minutes of a light dark cycle

279
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
So you have 16 nights in 16 days

280
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Forever Yours day

281
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
As they're working

282
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
This change is happening over at

283
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Over and over every 45 minutes to go from blazing light to

284
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Quiet.

285
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Blazing light to dark

286
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Lost

287
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
It will you get stories

288
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,423
Of people doing spacewalks that lose their orientation or feel like they're falling

289
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
So he says the only thing to do in that circumstance

290
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
It's just a focus on your job look straight ahead

291
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Only at the screw

292
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Only at the

293
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
Don't look down is kind of this

294
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
It's real in this business

295
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
So

296
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,511
We wouldn't perfectly happy to end the story right here cuz David Anatole finish that

297
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Repairs job well done

298
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Come back into the spacecraft

299
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
But we cannot not

300
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Tell you what happened

301
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
Different kind of Darkness

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
We'll continue that story

303
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919

Talking about dark side of the earth reminds me of another dark place

305
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
That would be your bedroom with the lights off while you're sleeping

306
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,951

Does Radiolab let's continue now with our story from Astronaut Dave wolf

321
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,671
That we performed live as part of Art in the dark tour in front of an audience about 2,500 people

322
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Where we left off

323
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Dave and his

324
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Cosmonaut

325
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Anatole

326
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
They had just been out in space

327
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Doing a space walk

328
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Repairing the

329
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Space Station

330
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
And they're about to Come Back Inn

331
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
So the two of them pull themselves by their tethers

332
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
The comeback

333
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Into the airlock to go back in

334
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
When it was time to Come Back Inn

335
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,783
They couldn't get back at you were locked out of your spaceship you could call it locked out we

336
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
We were trapped outside yes

337
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,159
Essentially their airlock was busted if they couldn't repressurise

338
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
If you can't get it at the right pressure

339
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
You can't win

340
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
And we worked on it for for 5 hours and

341
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,631
Ran out our resources and when second ran out of

342
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,983
Oh yeah we oxygen or what plenty of oxygen it turns out

343
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Then what you run out of first

344
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
Is your carbon dioxide scrubbing

345
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Yeah unit

346
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
Takes the CO2 out of your suit

347
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Another problem with this one is

348
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Usually

349
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
In space accident

350
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
You figure it'll only hurt for a moment

351
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Back

352
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
When you die

353
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
CO2 intoxication

354
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,327
That drags out that's not a that's a that's a miserable way to go

355
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,887
What it what does it mean did you ever find love

356
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
What happens if first you get a headache

357
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Then your muscle starts at which eventually your heartbeat starts with

358
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
Accelerate faster faster faster you go into convulsions and then you die

359
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Luckily

360
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,511
The life-support system has an extra cartridge that gave us an extra 6 or so hours

361
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
We used all that

362
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,167
And trying to fix the hatch and we couldn't get it to hold air

363
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
And

364
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
We were done

365
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
Did you know you were done I mean you're pretty much

366
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
And and over

367
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Yeah yeah no more ideas

368
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Done like in debt

369
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
So they decide okay we got to do something last dish maneuver if we can't get our usual airlocks work

370
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
Maybe we can make a new one because he on the Mir space station is this big cylinder with these rectangular module

371
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
One of those modules is the airlock Jason once but you're normally just a living quarters

372
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,503
Stop well if we can't get our usual airlock to pressurize the right pressure maybe we can go to the next one over

373
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
And up next module in as a airlock

374
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
And

375
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
We open the hatch into that next modules and in order to go to go into it we had

376
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
Had to disconnect the umbilicals

377
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Cuz you can't close a hatch over your umbilical right umbilical was providing our Cooling

378
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,127
You are suits so as soon as we disconnect it

379
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,271
Well that gives you maybe 5 8 minutes at Max before you before you what

380
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
I won't talk about it

381
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,671
It's so bad you did you did you look that up

382
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
What happens if you boil

383
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Inside your spacesuit ugly way

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
So they can actually think okay we've got to get through this tiny hatch into this room and they've got to do a fat

385
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
They also know if you struggle hard

386
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Go to fast you'll get much time at all in that suit before that heat builds up on you so thick

387
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Okay hurry hurry but slowly

388
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Hello

389
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
But I did not anticipate was as soon as we disconnected our umbilicals at the visor with fog up

390
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,839
Now be having to feel your way of blind

391
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
You can spit and kind of get a little area through the

392
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Fog

393
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
So I'm in the airlock

394
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
Trying to make my way into the next section

395
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,455
And I was crawling along the wall moving into the next section

396
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
And I Spit on my visor Rio to make a little hole to look through and get a hint

397
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,000
And it was an area I had been sleeping in some weeks before and

398
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
I left a picture of my family taped with Scotch tape on the wall

399
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
And I Spit on visor and my helmet light went there and there was a picture of my family

400
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
Right here in this moment

401
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,504
As I was scooting across the wall and in what was likely

402
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
My last minutes

403
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
So this is how it's going to end

404
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
So this is here

405
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
And didn't look at so strange there they are

406
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Did I look back at that

407
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
And I shudder

408
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Of course

409
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Dave and his partner

410
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Made it back in

411
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
YouTube space station

412
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Barely

413
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,600
But it didn't strike me really till months later

414
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
On the Earth

415
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Pow wow

416
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
How close a tab in

417
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,328
And what a strange situation

418
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
This Russian guy must be your best friend like

419
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,288
Gmail

420
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
Well not many people been through anything like that together and and and are there to talk about it and

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
You just reminded me of something

422
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,832
So we're going to leave you with one last story from Dave

423
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
He's got a story she

424
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,768
This is from that same stay in space involves the same friend and a totally they were out there doing some work

425
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
On the ship and floating space again

426
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
And then a mission control radios and

427
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Tell them to pause for a while we had

428
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
A period where we had to wait through the night

429
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,104
To go on with our work so he says up David uphill on Russian of course

430
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
I want to show you something

431
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
And we cooked our tethers on

432
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,272
Pushed ourselves about 6 feet away with

433
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
What about 60 to tether

434
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
So RI

435
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Couldn't see anything but out in space

436
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
I turn my air conditioner down a little nipple is kind of warm

437
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
And I was floating in this space suit just looking out

438
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
Into the Blackness of space

439
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
And

440
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
I felt like I didn't have a

441
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Space Unicorn

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
It was so comfortable

443
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
The air temperature was just right

444
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
I felt like I was just out in the universe in the star

445
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,024
I couldn't see anything that stars are all around me I couldn't feel anything

446
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Outside of spacecraft going

447
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
5 miles per

448
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888

450
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Was that what he wanted to show you

451
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776

He didn't want to talk he said let's just be

455
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
Why it turn your helmet light off

456
