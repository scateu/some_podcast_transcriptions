00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,088
This is Radiolab

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:31,488
That's weird if you would tell those people who might have missed what you were doing what you been doing

7
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,816
We just finished our first

8
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
Mini season of our first spin-off

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Call Moorpark

10
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,240
When you going to have part 2 part 2 is

11
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
Kunming

Yeah there's third they're definitely stories to tell for sure if you if you haven't checked it out.

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
Check it out at Radiolab.

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,000
It took me rescue you from this awkward situation by being back to Radiolab

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,584
Where I would like to begin by building a

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
A tall dark dense

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Green Forest

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Flowering trees

20
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
You're laughing

21
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Right now

22
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Anita

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
Bird

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Gmail

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Birds please

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
Birds why did like

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,856
Who started the street why are you do you give me

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
I want win Birds

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
How do I

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Alright nevermind

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
This story you'll get your sound of sun

32
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Begins with a woman or a man actually she was a very little girl

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
The outdoors

34
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
I mean

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Really love

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
The outdoors

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
When I was a little kid I would be in the fourth and I just eat

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
The forest

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
And I know lots of kids

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,368
Do that but I was going to say what do you mean you got down on all fours and just eat the dirt

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
This is Suzanne Simard

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,512
And so my mom always talks about how she had to constantly be giving me worm medicine because I was

43
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
I always had worms she's a forestry professor at the University of British Columbia and might as well start the store

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
So you back when she was a little girl when I was a kid I grew up in the rainforests of British Columbia and my fan

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Family

46
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Spent every summer

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm in this world

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
And her family included a dog named

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Cheeks and so in this particular summer when the event with jigs happened what kind of dog is jigs by the way

50
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
He was a

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Not a weiner. He was a what was he

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
You don't know what your dog what

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
Basset Hound

54
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,520
He was a beagle beagle he was a curious dog

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,896
And on this particular day she's with the whole family they're all out in the forest

56
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
It was summertime

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
And cheeks at some point just runs off

58
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Into the Woods

59
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Rabbit whatever

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
Couple minutes go by and all of a sudden

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
We could hear this

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Barking and yelping and

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
We were all like oh my goodness

64
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Texas in trouble

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
When school

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
The hope

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
Family in the uncles and

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
Aunts and cousins we all Rush up there

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
Do they follow the sound of the barking and it leads them to an outhouse

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
And when they go in there is jigs at the bottom of the old host

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
Probably six feet down at the bottom of the Outhouse pit

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
Oh dear we've all been you know

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Doing our daily business

74
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Falling in he's looking up at us

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,072
Quite scared and very unhappy that he was covered in

76
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
Oh and toilet paper and

77
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,288
Of course we had to get jigs out I mean jigs was part of the family

78
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,640
He was so deep down in there we had to dig from the five

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
To sort of like white in the hole

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,296
Basically expanding it from a kind of a column of a pit to something that

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
We can actually grab onto his

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
Front legs and swollen.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
And so

84
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Digging away

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
And jigs with you

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,423
Looking up with his paws you know looking at us waiting and they're digging and digging and digging and all of the sudden

87
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
She said she looks down into the ground and she notices

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
A tall round with a sore that has been cleared away

89
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
There are roots

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Enroute Sepang rootinest

91
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,063
Greasy Tangled we're sitting on the exposed root system which is like

92
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
It is like a mat it's it's like

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,535
It's just a mess of matter intertwining exposed roots that you could walk across the Never

94
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Fall through

95
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
She said it was like this moment

96
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Wish you realize only

97
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Is this

98
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Who are the world

99
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
Right beneath my feet jigsaw provided this incredible

100
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
Window for me

101
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
No ends digging EX

102
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
How many different

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
Colors they were how many different shapes

104
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
Afterwards that they were so intertwined

105
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
As abundant as what was going on above ground

106
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
It was magic for me

107
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
What's the what's the end of the story did jig

108
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
Did you emerge as we pulled Tigs out

109
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
And

110
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
We threw them in the lake with a great deal of yelping and

111
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Cursing and swearing and jigs

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Cleaned off

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,591
But that day with the roots is the day that she began thinking about

114
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Forest

115
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Texas

116
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Underneath

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,991
And now if you fast-forward roughly 30 years

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Even makes a discovery

119
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Lifeline

120
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
IND

121
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Amazing

122
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,463
She's working in the timber industry of the time this is by the way what her entire family had done

123
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Her dad and her grandparents

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
And when I came on the scene and 19 the need 1980 does a Forester

125
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
We were into Industrial

126
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
Large-scale clear-cutting in western Canada

127
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Huge machines

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Loaders and cats

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
She says a Timber Company would move in and clear-cut

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
An entire

131
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
Petrified Forest

132
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
MN plants and nutrients

133
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,039
And my job was to track how these new plantations would grow

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And she said she began to notice things

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
One wouldn't be lyrics

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Like

137
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Trees of difference be

138
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
Are supposed to fight each other for Sunshine right

139
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,399
Yeah

140
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Other way so they can get to the sky

141
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
But you was noticing that in a little patch of fur that she was studying if she had say

142
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Tree next to us

143
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Fir tree

144
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
And she took out the birch

145
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
The Douglas fir became disease and and died

146
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
There was some kind of benefit from the Birch to the fur

147
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
There was a healthier Community when they were mixed and I wanted to figure out why

148
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
Of course I could be at home any number of reasons why

149
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
No one trees affected by another

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
But she had a kind of

151
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Maybe call it

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Xen recollect

153
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,471
Flashback yes cuz she knew that scientists have proposed two years before

154
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
The underground

155
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Economy

156
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
It exists among trees that we can't see

157
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
And she wondered whether that was true

158
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
And so

159
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Design of experiments

160
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Figure that out

161
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
It was a simple little experiment theater

162
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Recover them in

163
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Plastic bags

164
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,375
Videos of plant the tree in a plastic bag and then I would inject

165
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Gaso tag with a with a knife

166
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,287
Which is radioactive so these trees were basically covered with bad

167
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Exit within filled with radioactive gas

168
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Suck up to photo center

169
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
So now they have the radioactive particles inside their trunk

170
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Are branches we had a geiger counter out there

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
As soon as we labeled them we use the geiger counter to 10 rounded up and down the trees and we could tell that they were hot they were

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,303
I mean I do what she wanted to know like

173
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
What's the radioactive particles

174
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,703
Entry what happens next will they stay in the tree or where they go

175
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
Down to the roots and then what have

176
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
And what you discovered is

177
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
All these trees only cheese at work

178
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Totally different species

179
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,855
We're sharing their food underground like if you put a food into one tree over here

180
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,207
It would end up in another tree maybe 30 feet away over there

181
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Tree over here

182
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
I'm going to 4th Street over there and V street over there 6th 7th 8th 9th

183
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
10th 11th Olin all turns out one tree was connected

184
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
47 other trees all around it was like

185
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
It was like a huge Network

186
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
And

187
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
We were able to map

188
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
The network

189
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,319
And what we found was that the trees that were the biggest in the oldest

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Were the most highly connected

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
SOB you know we

192
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
Identify these are kind of like hubs in the network

193
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
And when you look at the map what you see or Circle sprouting lines and connecting to other circles also sprouting line at a

194
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Used to look a lot like an airline flight

195
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
But even more dense

196
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,847
Just incredible Communications Network that

197
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,199
You know people have no idea about in the past because we couldn't didn't know how to look

198
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
It's definitely

199
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Crazy I mean

200
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,879
You're out there in the forest and you see all these trees and you think they're individuals just like

201
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Animals right

202
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
But no

203
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
They're all linked to each other called The Artful amoeba

204
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
It Scientific American

205
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Lincoln title

206
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
I spoke to her with our producer lettuce Nassar

207
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
And she told us that this

208
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
This network

209
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
He has developed a kind of a nice

210
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Funny sword name

211
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
The wood Wide Web

212
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
The wood Wide Web

213
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
The world wide web web it sounds like Elmer Fudd it would wait with

214
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
So this would wine

215
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,255
Is this just like the roots like what she saw in the Outhouse no no no no no

216
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Armoire

217
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Exciting than that

218
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
And sophisticated interesting in the

219
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,935
Astonishing

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,519
A completely separate organism I haven't mentioned yet I mean this is

221
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Going

222
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
What creature where we going I'm not going to tell you I'm going to

223
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
Go there we might look for a song I don't know where you were that day

224
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
Any chewing Stephanie danler intern

225
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,927
Things are producer we decided all to go to check it out for myself

226
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Think I'm not telling you about

227
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
We went to the Bronx

228
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
To the botanical gardens cuz we have to travel here in New York to get to actual Greenery Jackson was a beautiful green

229
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Sweat New York Hat

230
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
And when we went up there we there was this

231
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Whole man waiting for us

232
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
An expert

233
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Is that really

234
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
His name is Roy howling

235
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Unruly by the way comes out with the

236
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Strange

237
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
It's like a rake

238
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
Hezekiah expandable

239
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,647
It's a truffle rake

240
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Oh that sounds dangerous

241
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
I told her up there in this

242
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,583
Old Forest with this guy

243
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
He starts digging with his rake

244
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
At the base of the

245
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
Cubs away the leaves he shoves away the topsoil

246
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,735
And so now we're down there without a tablet

247
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:38,879
We carefully examining the roots of his Oak Tree on our knees with our noses in the ground that we can't see anything

248
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
But then

249
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Finally

250
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
You have the length

251
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Gives us a magnifying

252
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Little Jewelers glasses handheld

253
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Any answer to an

254
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,783
UCF

255
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Oh my gosh I do see them

256
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
What do you say

257
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,767
Threads attached to the roots smaller than an eyelash

258
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
Maybe just a tenth the width of your eyelash

259
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
But why

260
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Translucent

261
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Harry

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
And while it took us a while to see it apparently these little threads in the soil

263
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,247
And when you measure them

264
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
In a pinch of dirt

265
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
What are pinch

266
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
What is it like as a plant

267
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
What is a what kind of creature is this thing that's what is it

268
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
This

269
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Is the fungus

270
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
Which by the way is definitely not

271
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Appoint

272
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
There's some other kind of category in for a long time

273
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
They were thought of as plants

274
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
But now we know after having looked at their DNA

275
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
The funds are actually

276
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Very closely related to animals

277
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
They're one of our closest relatives Act

278
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Now back in the day

279
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Olga has a history of

280
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
When people first begin thinking about these things we're talking in the 1600s they had no idea what they were

281
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
What they did but ultimately they figured out that these things

282
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
We're very ancient

283
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Because

284
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
If you look at

285
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
400 million year old fossils

286
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Some of the very first plants

287
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
You can see

288
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Even in the roots

289
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
Earliest land plants see those threads

290
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
This is a really ancient Association

291
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,783
I'm in later scientists finally look at these things under much more powerful Michael

292
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
I realize the threads weren't threads

293
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
They were actually

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Tubes

295
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
How is little tubes

296
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Two tubes

297
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
And the tubes branch and sometimes they reconnect

298
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
So there seemed to be under the ground

299
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
This fungal freeway system connecting one tree

300
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
The next to the next to the next

301
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,615
People speculated about this would know what it actually proved it in nature in the woods

302
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Until

303
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
And there was a lot of skepticism at the time

304
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Over the next

305
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Two decades we did

306
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Experiment after experiment after experiment

307
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
That verified that story

308
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Suicide

309
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
What is this

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
Why is this network even there like why would the trees need a freeway system underneath the ground to connect

311
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Why would the

312
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
Why would the funds I want to make this

313
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
Why are they going to this trouble

314
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Creating this big Network

315
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Yeah well

316
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
They do it

317
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Because

318
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Tree has something the fungus need

319
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
The fungus

320
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
I something

321
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Trinis

322
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,247
Let me just back up for a second so that you

323
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
You came to set the scene for you

324
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,391
When you go into a forest you see a tree or a tall tree so what is the tree do what

325
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
This job sucks in sunshine takes the CO2 out of the air carbon dioxide which has carbon C

326
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
He in it

327
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
And it keeps the sea carbon which is

328
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Science beaker

329
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
For food that turns into sugar

330
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
What uses to make

331
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Its trunk

332
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
And its branches

333
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
The QC on a tree is just basically

334
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Are made into stuff

335
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Carbon and sugar the same thing

336
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
You can think of carbon is basically the sugar that builds the tree

337
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
However

338
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
If that's all they had was carbon

339
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Isn't it only be this tall

340
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
That's Roy again he's holding his hand

341
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,839
Maybe a foot off the ground would be a teeny tree it would be smaller

342
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
So if you could do is get carbon from the air

343
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
You never treat this

344
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Size of a tulip

345
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
A floppy tulip

346
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
A tree needs

347
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Something else

348
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
And what a tree needs

349
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm minerals minerals from the soil very similar to the sorts of vitamins and minerals that humans need

350
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
Does a tree need nitrogen and phosphorus magnesium potassium and calcium in

351
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Why what did he do for the tree

352
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Like a tree stand up straight without minerals

353
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Twerking

354
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,399
Is important for making a tree stand up straight

355
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
And lignin is

356
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
Full of nitrogen but also

357
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
Well, like nitrogen is important in DNA right it's an integral part of DNA

358
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
I want to be a healthy tree and reach for the sky then I need

359
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
I need rocks in May

360
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
Somehow liquid rock to you need the nutrients that are in the soil

361
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
And that's

362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Where the fungus comes in

363
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
The fungus

364
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,791
Has this incredible network of tubes that's able to send out through the soil

365
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
End

366
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Drop water

367
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
And mineral nutrients

368
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
That the tree needs where I thought I thought tree roots just sort of did like I thought I always imagined tree roots what kind of like straws

369
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Pause like the tree was like already doing that stuff

370
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
By itself but it's the fungus it's

371
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
Yes in a lot of cases it is the

372
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Just because

373
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,111
Tree roots in a lot of plant roots are not actually very good at

374
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,975
Doing what you think they're do she says the tree can only suck up what it needs through these

375
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
Almost to the Teeny tips of its roots

376
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
That's not enough bandwidth

377
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Which okay to the fungus is giving the tree the mineral

378
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
What is the tree giving back to the fungus

379
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Remember I told you how trees make sugar

380
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
So that's

381
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Switch the tree gift

382
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
The founder of sugar

383
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
The funds I need sugar to build their bodies

384
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
The same way that we use our food

385
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
To build our bodies they can't photosynthesize

386
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
They can't take up CO2

387
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
And so they have the

388
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
The trading system with trees

389
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
She says what will happen under the ground is that the fungal tubes was

390
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Stretch up toward the tree roots

391
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,535
I meant they'll tell the tree with their chemical language I'm in the neighborhood

392
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Can you

393
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Will you

394
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Soften your route so that I can invade your roots

395
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
And the tree gets the message

396
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
And it sends a message back and says

397
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Yeah I can do that

398
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Like I can start softening up my

399
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
The walls and make room for you

400
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Animals little tubes will wrap themselves

401
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
In the place

402
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
The little bits

403
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
White dress you can see the white stuff is the fungus

404
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
And we saw this in the Bronx that the little threads just

405
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
Wrapping themselves around the tree roots

406
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
The last kind of part of the route

407
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Entangled stirring the edge

408
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
And it's getting that little space between them that they make the exchange

409
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
What is century

410
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
That would be

411
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Sugar sugar

412
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Benadryl sugar

413
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,431
Mineral sugar

414
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
I forgot to ask you something

415
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,391
82 if the tube system is giving the trees the minerals how is it getting it

416
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
The minerals

417
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
How's it getting ready to pull in from the soil

418
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Well that's a mirror

419
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
That's why

420
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
That is

421
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,143
I got a doing the story this is the part

422
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Knocked me

423
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
We'll be right back

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

432
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
And I'm here because I need your help

433
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
And I request

434
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

435
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,871
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling

436
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
Tiny moments of brilliance

437
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,271
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

438
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
It just means you bring back and say whoa

439
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Maybe it was the moment that I

440
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

441
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Do you

442
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

443
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

444
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,775
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

445
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
We're interested in the

446
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Epic moments where

447
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,711
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

448
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991

Thank you so much

Run this is Radiolab and what was it what was the answer

457
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Question about how did how did the fungus get the minerals

458
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
It is a three-pronged answer

459
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
What a fungus does is it

460
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
It hunts

461
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Get mines it fishes

462
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
And it strangles what I'm not making this up in 1997 a couple of scientists wrote a paper

463
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
Which describes how fungi have developed a system

464
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Remaining Jennifer says that what the tubes do

465
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Is the

466
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,103
Worm their way back and forth through this

467
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Well until

468
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,223
They bump into some Pebbles be little soil particles

469
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Packets of minerals and then say

470
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,440
Acid amino acids come out and start to dissolve the Rocks like you're Drilling and the fungus actually build a tunnel

471
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,280
Inside the rock can reach these little

472
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Packets of minerals

473
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
And

474
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Minam

475
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
What if you look at these particles

476
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
Under the microscope you can see the little tunnels that curve sometimes they Branch they look just like mining tunnels

477
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
This is very like if you had little helmet with a light on it like I'm a human maybe not with a helmet but yeah

478
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,088
Snow White and the Seven tubes or something and that's just the beginning Jennifer.

479
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
About another role that these funcheap

Nethunter

481
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
Hunter what do you mean like the

482
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:55,072
The plant is hunting for water

483
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
Is hunting how do you make how do you mean

484
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
So there's a little insects that live in the soil just adorable little creatures called springtails

485
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Flea size and they spend lots of time munching leaves on the forest floor called springtails cuz a lot of them have a little Oregon

486
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
The back that they actually can kind of

487
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
Deploy instantly spring way up high in the air David Attenborough

488
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Want to look on YouTube

489
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,208
Gypsy takes in nail

490
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Hooksett

491
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:30,912
Episode Springtime and you don't see it

492
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
Then of course because the BBC they take a picture of it it's doing like a triple double axle back flip or something into the sky

493
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
Equivalent of a human being

494
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Jumping over the eye

Annie

497
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
One of the things they eat

498
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Fungus

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
But then

500
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,368
Scientist did an experiment where they gave some springtails some fungus

501
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Put them all together in a dish

502
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
And they walked away

503
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
And then they came back

504
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
And they found that

505
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Mosto springtails are dead

506
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Instead of eating the fungus

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
It turns out the fungus

508
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Eat them

509
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
In the little Springhill bodies that were little

510
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Tubes growing inside them

511
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
And this is what makes it even more gruesome they

512
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
Somehow have a Dye don't ask me how they know this

513
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,320
How to figure it out but they have a little stain that they can put on the springtails to tell if they're alive or dead

514
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
When they did this

515
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
They saw that a lot of the springtails

516
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
That had their tubes inside them

517
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,304
We're still alive

518
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
Rule

519
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
The fungus would literally sucking the nitrogen out of the Springdale

520
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Taylor was too late to get away nope

521
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Anymore

522
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,664
And then they did experiments with the same fungus that I'm telling you about that was capturing the springtails

523
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
And they hooked it up to a

524
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
Tree to try to calculate how much Spring Hill nitrogen is traveling back to the treatwell

525
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
25% of it ended up in the trees

526
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
So they figured out who paid for the murder

527
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
Is there anyone whose job it is

528
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
How to draw a little chalk outlines around the

529
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,936
Springfield

530
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
Inspector tail is his name

531
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,592
Is the only spring-trap with a trench coat and other

532
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
Fedora

533
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
I have even I can go better than even that

534
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Javier's

535
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
They have found

536
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Entryway

537
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Like as in the fish

538
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
In the tree in the tree well

539
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,744
In a way how in the hell is apparently Bears Park themselves in places

540
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,864
And grab fish out of the water and then you know to take a bite and throw the carcass down on the ground

541
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
The fungi

542
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,704
It's rained and snowed in the carcass

543
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Seeps down into the soil a bit the fungi then go and they drink the salmon carcass down and it send it off

544
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
To the tree

545
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
That's insane salmon rings in trees

546
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,928
Saying there are forests

547
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
That we are trees that decided to found

548
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
Rough to 75% of the nitrogen in the tree

549
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Turns out to be

550
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Food from just

551
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,192
Bears throwing fish on the ground you if you would take away the fish

552
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
The trees would be like

553
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Blitz Harbour

554
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,152
And in it and is it as dramatic in the opposite direction like the fungus to be given the

555
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Trees a lot of minerals

556
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,528
I like the trees are so I can how much of their sugar

557
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Are they giving you the fungus will I ask who's Annabelle

558
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,696
Like 2% or 2.00%

559
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,072
No I'm well people have been measuring this in different for us and ecosystems around the world and

560
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
The estimate is anywhere from 20 to 80

561
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
Percent will go into the Cabrillo Brown

562
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
20 to 80%

563
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,128
I'll go into the fallopian tubes into the into the roots and then into the

564
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
Microbial Community which includes the mushroom team

565
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
The point here is that the

566
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
The scale of this is

567
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
So

568
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
That we didn't know this until very recently

569
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
You have a forest

570
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,232
You have mushrooms now it turns out that their Network and together they're capable of doing that

571
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
A behaviors for Restoril Behavior

572
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Did a deep cleaning

573
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
We just learning about them.

574
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Under sew in

575
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:27,200
Let's say it's times are good the tree has a lot of sugar I don't really need it all right now

576
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
I'll put it down in my fun July

577
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
And then when times are hard

578
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
The funds I will give you my sugar back

579
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
And I can start growing again

580
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
Give me the fun Joe give me my sugar back

581
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
It is like a bag

582
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
She says we now know the trees give each other load

583
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,144
Oh yeah back and forth seasonally

584
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
They can also send warning signals

585
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:53,056
Through the fungus we've done experiments and other people in different

586
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Labs around the world

587
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
They've been able to figure out the different trees injured

588
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
People cry out to the kind of chemical weigh

589
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
And those

590
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
Chemicals will then move through the network in Warren

591
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Neighboring

592
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,488
Trees are seedlings that something bad is happening and I'm under a tack

593
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
There's an enemy in the midst

594
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
So if a beetle where to invade the forest

595
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
The trees tell the next tree over

596
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Here come the Paul Revere

597
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Sort of yes that seems to be what would happen

598
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,872
Chicken you can see this is like a game of telephone one tree hill

599
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,944
Start producing chemicals that taste really bad

600
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
So the Beatles don't want him

601
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
I don't want that

602
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
What are the spookiest examples of

603
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Suzanne mention

604
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,024
Is an experiment that she and her team did where they discovered

605
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
But if a ferret is warming up

606
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
What is happening all over the world

607
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Temperatures are rising

608
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:56,288
You have trees in this Forest that are hurting I don't do well in warm temperatures and their needles turn off 6

609
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,384
Yellow they will send out a good signal

610
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
But also

611
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,040
Important thing we figured out is that as those trees are injured and dying

612
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
Dumpster carbon into their neighbors so so carbon will move from that dying tree so it's real

613
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Resources at Legacy will move

614
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
Into the microphone Network into neighboring trees

615
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
Oh so it says to the new or the healthier trees

616
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Here's my food

617
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Take it it's yours

618
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Or it could be like okay

619
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:33,152
I'm not doing too well so I'm going to hide this down here in my mycelium a bank or if you're a

620
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
So it's not necessarily saying give it to the new guy

621
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,832
We don't know it again it's a tree

622
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
I'm just trying to explain make sure I understand I realize that none of these conversations you actually

623
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,536
Spoken give it to the new guy give it to the news

624
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Yes

625
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,400
Suzanne said she's not sure if the tree is running the show and say like

626
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
I'll give it to the new guy

627
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,520
It's the fungus under the ground is kind of like a broker and decides who gets

628
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
You know I don't completely understand

629
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
She has one of the weirdest

630
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Parts of this dog

631
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,736
Is wincek trees give up their food The food doesn't usually go to there

632
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Kids

633
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Or even the trees are the same

634
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Species what the team Fair

635
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,648
Is the food ends up very often with

636
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,488
Trees that are new in the forest and better at surviving global warming

637
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
It's as if the individual trees

638
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Somehow

639
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Thinking

640
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Ahead

641
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
To the needs of the whole forests

642
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,520
So we know that Douglas fir will take a dying to go through will send carbon to neighboring

643
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Ponderosa pine

644
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,152
Answer why is that so and I think that you know the whole

645
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Forest then

646
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
There's an intelligence there that's beyond just

647
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,576
Wait a second wait a second you just used

648
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
A very

649
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Twisting words

650
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Robert

651
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
You know what it's

652
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
10

653
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
All right

654
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
Unfortunately right at that point Suzanne

655
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Basically ran off to another meeting

656
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
But

657
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
Lou's Gun speaking

658
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
We could catch up with her a few weeks later

659
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
When we last left off I'm just saying you just said in

660
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Intelligent

661
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Elison

662
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Doesn't

663
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,504
Don't professors begin to start falling out of chairs

664
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
When Network gets used regarding

665
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Plants

666
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Yes

667
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,648
We don't normally ascribe intelligence to plant

668
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
I'm in plants are not thought to have

669
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Brains

670
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
But when we look at the below ground

671
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Structure it looks

672
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
So much like a brain

673
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Physically

674
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
And now that we're starting to understand how it works

675
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Speaking bothers so many

676
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
I do find it magic

677
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,760
I think there is something like a nervous system in the forest

678
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Because

679
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
It's the same sort of

680
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Large Network

681
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
Of nodes

682
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Sending signals to one another

683
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
It's almost as if

684
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
The force is acting

685
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
As an organism

686
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
Itself

687
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
You know they talk about how

688
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
Honey bee colonies

689
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
AR

690
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Sort of superorganism

691
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Because

692
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,176
Each individual be a sort of acting like it's a cell in a larger body

693
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,296
Once you understand that the trees are all connected to each other all signaling each other

694
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
Sending food and resources to each other

695
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,208
Filled flavor of something very similar

If your springtails

716

Don't talk to strange mushrooms

717
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
