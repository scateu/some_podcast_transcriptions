Basic

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Then

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
She went away for the weekend

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
And when I came back

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
I turned the computer on

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
And

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
Like it was doing something

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,616

00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,504
Those windows X cannot open any of them

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
And I could not figure but it was

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Vera latest 9

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Message pop up

Encrypted using cryptowall

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
This means that the structure and data within your files have been irrevocably changed

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
And in order to give them back you must pay 500

58
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
US dollars if you really value your data

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Then we suggest that you do not waste valuable time searching for the solutions because they do not exist

60
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,576
You're saying Somebody went into your computer and locked up all of your things yeah they

Even better

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,824
Did you know everybody talks about excellence and test

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848

Severe underemployment problem

78
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696

What we're talking about

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Eno Backwater

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
I was supposed to

84
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
That

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
It comes from their part of the world

86
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
That I wrote them

87
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
In the rush

88
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
Add provider a link to a website where

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176

00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
I wrote them

91
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,184
How to translate it in English more accurately Simpson Lake I wish you all.

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,791
In Russian language

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
There is a V-Rod

94
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
To die for cumin or another word for animals

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Yes no

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
But they got them

97
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,943
Nina says she thought about just wiping a computer clean so that she wouldn't have to pay

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
Events occur to her that her husband had all these files on there

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
You're like business receipt City hadn't filed

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
Did she is lazy to do so he has cancer

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
An end she's right that like you know she has this

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Is tax information

103
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Reimbursement information

104
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,655
Ultimately it's worth more than $500 my husband didn't respond to pay overalls

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,567
Tokina decides to follow the instructions base

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,967
1 download and install Tor Browser

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Is Moltres about

108
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Rhonda browser and wait for initialization

109
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
She does that

110
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
3 Type in the address bar Cape a 7-way CR7 jet skis

111
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Walter luck if you don't trust

112
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Savvy can decrypt

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
One of your files

114
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
For free

115
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
Is a sample that when you pay us

116
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
If you would know that you could

117
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Really get

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
All your files back

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
I was curious

120
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
I decided that I will try

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
So she clicked the button that said yes

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
And one

123
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
File back

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
But as soon as I did

125
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Are there clocks that thicken

126
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Literally she says I will clock appear.

127
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
The top of the browser

128
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
They give me example S7

129
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
167 hours

130
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
59 minutes

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
59 seconds

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
So you decrypt a thing and then suddenly it's a countdown to the yes they say if you won't pay by this

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
Is this them Define

134
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,183
Will be doubled and it won't be in the 1 movie

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
Then you will lose your files forever

136
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
And you will never get it back

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,447
Now in the message should have told Gina that she had to pay that $500 fine not in dollars

138
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Button bit

139
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
You know I

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
The Disco Victorious

141
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Time

142
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
In my life ever

143
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
I saw the tumba.

144
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
So I

145
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
The phone this

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527

00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,111
Called Queen Cafe where you can buy Bitcoin

148
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
A.m. to buy this Bitcoins is it nice

149
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
It's at 4

150
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,863
What you needed to do with exchange five hundred bucks for the requisite amount of Bitcoins

151
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
And at the time 500 bucks equal to 1.37 bit

152
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
But before she could even make that Exchange

153
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Chittor Philadelphia

154
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847

Bitcoin everything is well listed one of them was rims

157
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,415
Yes I told the first reason to pay

158
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
A ransom to the criminal

159
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Next

160
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Forms you have to make it big

161
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
And send them a photograph

162
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Through the internet

163
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Okay

164
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
I did not give a camera because

165
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
She says her camera and having to be in the shop

166
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
More than that

167
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
I have to

168
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Make a picture

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,575
Of my husband holding the driver's license

170
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Send them

171
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
This picture back

172
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,535
Place the bank where the criminals are there

173
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
People

174
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,655
Who sell you Bitcoin exchange for your money

175
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
I told you that it's a torches

176
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Unbelievable

177
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,055
But eventually she was able to find a neighbor borrow the camera take

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Russia news attack

179
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,943
Then she had to get the money she wanted to exchange to coincafe and it turns out

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
Preferred way to do it the most secure way to do it is not online but

181
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Do a money order

182
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
Abyssal the day right before Thanksgiving

183
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Wednesday

00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Still had about six days before the deadline

00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
Pop down to the post office get a money order

Lexington and the cool Massachusetts

188
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263

Through the snow almost kills herself but gets there gets everything together send it off

193
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
So finally

194
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
I send everything

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Tune out

196
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
The post office

197
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Assured me that they will get it

198
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
On Friday

199
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703

Up The Descent

201
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Okay so

202
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,383
On Friday they did not get it

203
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
On Saturday if they did not get it

204
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,551
On Monday in the morning nothing was delivered

205
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
And I was deaf

206
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111

210
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Finally waclaw

211
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,823
In the afternoon on Monday 24 hours for the deadline

212
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
They send me Bitcoin

213
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Election because they got my money

214
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783

215
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
She says when she went online to check her Bitcoin at

216
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903

7 people all lined up at the single ATM that you guys were totally not 50

290
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Most people do take care of this remote

291
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Like there was no

292
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
What was funny about the HMS like I'm expecting the cast into an ATM like I have a Capital One account I know what

293
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,727
10 ATM is like the second floor of a work share space in Brooklyn is like

294
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,359
In the hallway there was like a bike hanging from a wall kind of blocking and there's like a paper sign

295
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Taped to the wall that just

296
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,295
Had a printout from a computer that just said Bitcoin ATM all lowercase letters in an arrow to this

297
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Phone but it looked very Soviet

298
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
Like if you've seen photos of those phones with no buttons and there's two

299
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
Just a receiver and it's totally scary and quite like you just pick it up and like somebody's always on the other line

300
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
It was like that it was just

301
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Justice box

302
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703

00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
QRC code up to the camera online

317
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095

00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Accessing your account

320
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
And then

Very cool I didn't

331
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,583
I think that would happen and so you know the technician was there and he fixed the machine and he

332
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Helps me deposit

333
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
$95

334
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215
And then he was there talking and he was

335
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
He was like yeah you know he knew my mom

336
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,407
Casquito he'd been talking to on the phone he's like I feel so bad for your mom we've been getting so many of these cases and I'm like

Guys getting so why is that

339
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,671
And he's like oh I know why because in the ransom note that they give a list of preferred

340
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,535
Vendors and we are number one or two the introduction with a bad introduction

341
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
What's a bitcoin

342
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:07,167
Like we're going to hold you ransom for all your information until you

00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983

344
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263

345
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
This is my coats and John ha they are the co-owners of

346
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Coincafe

347
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
A few weeks back

348
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
The grandmother

349
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
Who was in tears she was going to lose all of her family photos

350
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Because the deadline is come

351
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Crying on the phone to me

352
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Got it

353
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,255
Acrylic people who sell Bitcoin just believe that there should be a digital currency that is decentralized

354
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
It doesn't rely on the banks

355
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
But unfortunately has become the currency of choice

356
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
Ransom

357
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Hey there in this weird position so it's a tricky thing because

358
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Like I can't sell Bitcoin to someone who I know is going to do something illegal with it right that's will wheeler who run the Bitcoin exchange

359
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
Call Express he says he and the other exchanges are really worried right

360
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Is it they keep helping little guys pay the ransom

361
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Nor to get their files back

362
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
They are in effect making themselves

363
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
Accessories to a crime I finally got a call back from fencing

364
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Which is the federal Authority for

365
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Financial crime enforcement Network

366
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
They said that

367
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
We could perceive

368
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Paying a ransom

369
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Unlawful activity

370
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
And so

371
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
They might choose to use that against

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
The company

373
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Who helps out right

374
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Unlikely

375
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,247
Until we get a straight answer from Vince and we'll take the overly cautious approach and

376
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Start the cleaning these transactions

377
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
Even though in your heart you want to help

378
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,439
Do you want to risk being indicted for helping you get your travel route

379
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Reimbursed

380
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
And I mean to me answers now

381
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
In any case

382
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,751
After Alina deposits the extra 25 bucks in her mom's

383
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:51,103
Bitcoin account Nina the mom goes online

384
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
And it was gone

385
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
But

386
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Then

387
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
About an hour later

388
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Went to my computer

389
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
And there was another message

390
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
That you're late

391
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,535
No doubt that I was doing the half

392
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
You have to pay

393
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
1000

394
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
$300

395
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Roughly

396
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
I did not have anybody to turn to

397
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
So she went to that same website where you can write them

398
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,991
I wrote them that I was laid but I mentioned the snow storm

399
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
The things given which they probably

400
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
And the

401
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
The wonderful us

402
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Mail service

403
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,863
I said that I tried and I was only two

404
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Hours

405
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Late

406
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
And then all of a sudden

407
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
I'm getting the message

408
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
You paid

409
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
In full

410
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,991
Without any explanation nothing Cupid

411
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
This it

412
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
And I got all my files back

413
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
They took pity on her

414
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Maybe I found

415
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
That it's

416
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Finally

417
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
Really woman

418
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Make you wonder why

419
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
These people

420
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407

Childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

437
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

438
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,335
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

439
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:36,735
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

440
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

441
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,912
Joseph Mann investigative reporter for Reuters

Was the

453
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
It is right there talking people

454
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Russian-speaking Folks by and large

455
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Your book called fatal

456
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
System error which

457
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,480
Just heard of a deep dive into the Russian hacking scene and much of it is as you'd expect

458
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Second young guys

459
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
Early twenties

460
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
Kind of grubby by and large they do not live the lavish

461
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
Lifestyle there are guys at the top of these criminal organizations

462
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
That are very flashy

463
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
And if they're like sword

464
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Stop

465
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
Icon some of them in the same way that rap stars

466
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Are in the US

467
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
There's a hacker magazine

468
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Viccino's as Gaz

469
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,312

Buying bottle service if you know disco's between them

472
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
What are the guys who hire the 20 year olds they hired a 20 year olds for their franchise

473
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576

474
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Work at office

475
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Yeah that's like a call

476
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Is there like

477
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Keno

478
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
The producer Kelsey

479
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Apache maven

480
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
In a cubicle

481
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Artist computer

482
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Bored

483
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
His meeting later with Judy in HR

484
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
He's mad about it

485
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
Is that the kind of like environment

486
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,056
These people are in for the most part I think so yes

487
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
The larger point is that it's not just like your Lone Wolf pimp

488
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Ugly face hacker

489
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
Any more cyber crime is now

490
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Super organized

491
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
It is awesome

492
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Incorporate

493
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
It is Big Business

494
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
In the hole

495
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,952
Economy seems to revolve around the secret sites

496
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,512
Where people come together to buy and sell things like

497
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
That ransomware story Underground

498
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Webforms

499
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
The end there's a right

500
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Some are available you can reach you on the open internet

501
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
The more impressive ones are password

502
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Protected you know you have to know somebody to get in

503
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
The really really

504
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Fancy one

505
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
You have to have a couple of people vouch for

506
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,040
Apply with your resume at your hackers resume here are the things I can bring these are the kinds of

507
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,624
Hacking exploit that I've had in there for I should be part of your

508
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,768
Let's Dina temple-raston NPR cybercrime corresponding

509
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
She's been tracking the government

510
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Attempts to shut down

511
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
Lights which she describes as

512
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Hackers

513
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,264
Black Market Bazaar to let's say someone is looking for a bunch of credit card numbers

514
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
You can get it

515
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
There's one price if their master

516
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Jacquard gold and

517
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
And another price

518
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
No higher-level credit whatever I say

519
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
You wanted to know about a boss

520
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016
Skyward employee

521
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Dior

522
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,928
You can get this piece of software that allows you to turn on their phone anytime you could basically eavesdrop on them cuz you're in the pocket

523
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
And for $300 a month

524
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
You would actually get

525
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Customer service

526
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
And the price is actually keep coming out it's a very very

527
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
Evolved

528
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Fluid Market

529
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
There's feedback

530
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:13,056
And there's escrow there are feedback forms going to ask you that Thief was not really there

531
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
I didn't didn't do the fever

532
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
The robbery right absolutely

533
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Protect me for something you'll see it a lot for freshness

534
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Credit cards

Cuz you know it's easy to say y'all here 10000 credit card

536
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
But if their credit card numbers

537
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
After while

538
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
And get the client every

539
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
You just wasted

540
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Your money and these people called Rippers

541
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
As in they're ripping you off

542
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
And they will get banned

543
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,144
Wow so it's reputational just like everywhere else it's as good as

544
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
If you feel safe

545
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
Doing business on eBay there's no reason you shouldn't

546
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
All of this

547
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
To me frankly felt like just a sexy hacker talk

548
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,968
Until a couple of months ago dinosaur telling us about this one

549
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Particular site actually the biggest

550
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Of these kind of sites

551
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
It's out there it's called Dark code the way it has been described by law enforcement is sort of an amazon.com

552
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,512
Phone for hackers specifically how us attorney David Hicks

553
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Describe to her in an interview

554
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Darkode

555
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,888

Criminal cyber crime Forum in the world

557
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,288
When did I think most people know Silk Road and they know for example

558
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
So you could get a contract hit

559
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Silk Road drugs

560
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Some guns and everything else

561
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
So would it be right for me to say that this was sort of a silk road for hackers

562
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,136
Yeah I wouldn't want to drive that direct comparison I think it's probably accurate I would say that all measure of cybercrime

563
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
That you see and watch

564
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,744
Around the world was in some form or fashion connected to it

565
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,352
So we got really interested in this world of this site darkode into

566
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
People in it

567
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
And so with Dina

568
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
We started calling around trying to find anyone that would talk

569
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,104
After weeks of searching and calling and loitering we found a guy who agreed to go on the rack

570
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
My name is Daniel placek

571
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
And

572
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
I am a reformed hacker

573
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
As far as We Know Dan has never talked about this

574
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,856
So how did you get involved with dark

575
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Well I was

576
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
One of the people who created it

577
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
A very long time ago

578
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:14,912
Daniel Story begins not in Russia but in Milwaukee sure will let me start with a little account small middle-class suburb

579
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
Right outside Milwaukee

580
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Your brothers and sisters

581
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
Two younger brothers and two younger sister

582
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Big family

583
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
Did you have to share rooms with them or will you and your own

584
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Kingdom High share the room with both my brothers

585
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Search for a lot of years

586
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,784
Becca syrup lazy to the story cuz he says what he would do

587
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Escape

588
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Please go to the basement

589
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
Play video game

590
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,952
So yes the the stereotypical hacker in his parents basement

591
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
I know

592
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Quite hilarious

593
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,912
Densetsu hacking began innocently enough when he would monkey with games like Age of Empire

594
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,776
I'd change the graphics change the artificial intelligence in the game the way it plays

595
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Rework it create new maps that type

596
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
Something I enjoyed

597
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
And slowly on throughout my teenage years that

598
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Develop into something more

599
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Do not get along well with

600
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
A lot of my peers

601
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Creighton Middle School

602
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
So

603
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
I spent

604
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
A lot more time you know on the computer and

605
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
I myself and I did

606
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Socially at least at that age

607
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
And he says one day he was in a chat room internet chat room

608
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
It's called game search talking with a bunch of other people out video games

609
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
And at some point along the way

610
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,528
Can meet this guy you know this for this particular guy was into

611
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
In a botanist

612
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh yes spotnitz we all try yes you just remind us

613
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,792
Sorry no malware viruses installed on computers

614
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Sand

615
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
Bob netzkino are the way to centrally control

616
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Whole lot of

617
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Computers just to put this in context

618
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
X-Force exiting satolli fascinating

619
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,568
Joseph man says this whole botnet

620
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
Situation

621
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
It started with fam

622
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
One of the easiest ways

623
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
How to make money on the internet back pre-2000

624
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Was

625
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
Spam is in a penis extension

626
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
What happened was that the

627
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
In the olden days most

628
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Servers mail servers

629
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
I acted is open relay

630
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
Meaning the mail people wouldn't really pay attention to who was sending one

631
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
To the spammers with Spam with abandon

632
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
And then spam got to be enough

633
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Sofa problem

634
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Is that the techies of the world

635
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Decided

636
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
They started to block

637
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Like if they found a guy who is

638
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
They thought was standing too many product emails or whatever

639
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
They would block his IP address

640
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Couldn't send any more

641
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,296
So what the spammers and their contractors that need

642
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
Needed to do was to have a bunch of

643
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
Clean IP address

644
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Ants in Spanish

645
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
From that so what they did

646
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Totally genius totally evil

647
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
Is a hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of virus

648
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
Disseminated those viruses across the internet

649
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
People with

650
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Accidentally clicker open something

651
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Get them onto their

652
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Computer

653
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,104
And then suddenly the spammers couldn't remote control

654
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
ARROW computers

655
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
At a distance

656
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
I really wanted to maybe just

657
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
An hour to an eye

658
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,552
To send out their spam cuz he's work clean IP address

659
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
Of course what happened

660
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Is it once the spammers

661
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
How do you spot

662
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
Is there thinking I could do something else with

663
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
And that the next thing that came along

664
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
You can have all of them try to contact

665
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Ebay.com

666
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Gametime

667
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
And knock over

668
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
The first gentleman that I ran to he had about nuts

669
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Well over a thousand

670
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Which

671
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
I know what the time was amazing

672
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
You know by today's standards

673
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
1000

674
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Provide medicine

675
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
It's nothing now they can get him into the millions but

676
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Back then it was quite incredible

677
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
Comedian Disney tattoos

678
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
This guy would get into fights

679
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Anytime you did

680
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
He point his

681
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,512
1000 computer drone Army at that enemy in a few man I'm going to knock your internet off

682
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
There's nothing you can do about it

683
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
You know if it was something in a game he could knock

684
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,448
The game server that they're playing on offline and stop their game

685
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,056
Things like that it's like you can take away your ball back in 1935

686
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
That is exactly at

687
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
Taking away someone else's ball over the

688
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,688
So this for some reason intrigued

689
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Yes

690
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Was amazing

691
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
I'm like your control a thousand computers wow

692
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
You know how how did you do this you know I I I

693
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Timeout

694
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
Never heard about that so I didn't know about any of this stuff like how did you

695
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,608
How did you get the software to do this how did you get it on to all these computers only quite happy to tell you

696
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
We certainly was this

697
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
This particular gentleman

698
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Have very large

699
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
You go and did you see him as a

700
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Bad guy

701
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
To be honest

702
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,360
I think at that age

703
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Guy

704
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
Didn't really

705
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Think about it

706
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
It's the Internet it's

707
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
It's a lot harder.

708
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
2

709
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Quantify right and wrong

710
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Now it's easy to look back

711
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Yeah this is

712
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,744
Wrong but it's not like going up to someone and punching them in the face

713
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
There's no

714
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,096
Human connection there you don't see these people are feel these people

715
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
He said at the time it was just sheer curiosity

716
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
So he says he asked

717
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Ask this Pied Piper guide

718
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
To send him somewhere

719
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
We bought soft

720
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
The botnet

721
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
And that really intrigued

722
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
No digging through the source code trying to understand

723
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
What is this thing doing how does it work how does a tick

724
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
This guy was you could koetter

725
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Like isn't he good at it

726
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
Was he good at it yet

727
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,184
No no II would you know in hindsight now

728
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
You know he's what I would classify as a

729
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Play script Kitty

730
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:33,888
You know someone who

731
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Script Kitty

732
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
So ask Kitty is

733
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Is someone who

734
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
Just enough technical ability to

735
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Going to take some tools and software that other people have

736
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Created in

737
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
Fast forward

738
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,528
As Dan went the opposite direction of the script kiddies and God

739
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
Better and better

740
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Start making me the spot Nets that could

741
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Literally

742
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Spy on people as they were using their computers

743
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,256
Thing to see all the pouring that people are watching that type of thing

744
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,328
He says he found himself in another chat

745
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
That was called

746
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Place where hackers swap tips Bragg take a look what I did by 2face this website take a look and he says Monday

747
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
He was talking with a friend of his

748
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
Is there. We were talking and

749
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Why do we set up a community

750
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
Where we can really filter who gets the

751
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
What all is script kiddies in idiots

752
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
I actually chose the name

753
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
I came up with that

754
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
My slime name

755
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
I just think it's pretty good what's the name again

756
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,048
Dark coated AR k o d e s

757
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,840
I think right seems cooler with a k

758
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,168
Yes so you chose the name and started getting the site set

759
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
The rules were it would be invite only

760
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,056
She had an invite and each new person would be required to demonstrate their skill

761
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
He's a piece of software that I created

762
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Here's a video of my botnet and action

763
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
And at some point

764
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
I'm not too long after

765
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
It was decided for one reason or another that

766
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Hey we got all these programmers on here that's great but

767
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
They also want to be able to

768
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Sell some stuff

769
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Think so

770
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,792
Let's invite some people who would be willing to buy

771
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
This sound like a fairy so I have

772
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
A burglar

773
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
True up do you have a door you want a burger

774
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,800
I'll get you my tool what's a simplification but yeah

775
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
People with post

776
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
And say

777
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm looking to buy a

778
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Or here's a piece of software I created he resolved

779
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,784
Things that does here's some screenshots button action

780
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Here's price

781
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Could be

782
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
Certain type of botnet software

783
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
It could be buying a bond that itself

784
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
You know if you don't want to build one yourself

785
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Someone that somebody else

786
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,400
Wheaton has going to me I can get you onto 200,000 or 20,000 computers

787
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936

788
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984

00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,544
It's all your hey guys I've got installs

790
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
And they're $10 /

791
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Something like that

792
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,040
Now this is some sort of surprising to us then when it comes to find that there's this whole rental

793
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
It's frightened Lee affordable

794
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Bargain Basement

795
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
Integra talking with one reporter Kelly Jackson Higgins

796
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
Who is the executive editor of dark reading.com witches

797
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Cyber security news site

798
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
She told us you can actually rent to buy

799
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
If you really wanted to you could rent

800
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
About net for 1 hour

801
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
About $38 a month

802
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
I can rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month if you could

803
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,248
Like renting space here you want to use this to go do damage somewhere or you want to make a statement or

804
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,600
You have some plan for our do you want to send some spam here you go you could go online right now

805
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
Probably find somewhere out there in the net

806
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
Somebody who will sell you access to computers for

807
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,144
Sense of Peace like people's computers like your computer my computer and Dan says as dark code got bigger in

808
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Bigger

809
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,728
More of this kind of activity on the site

810
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:54,848
Like some kind of a botnet of 5000 computers another guy would have some software like the ransomware

811
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,200
Suffragette within rent botnet and guy one install his ransomware

812
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,272
Rental these poor people then move on to know some of the people

813
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
Where

814
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
You're doing some pretty unpleasant things

815
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
And I'm moving more into the

816
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Financial crime

817
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Pretoria matches

818
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,536
There's something that I really never had a desire to be involved in

819
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
It was largely because of that he says that in 2009

820
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
He decided to get a

821
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
But unfortunately the next year

822
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
I got a lovely visit from the

823
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
FBI

824
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
They promptly

825
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,432
With it at like a kick down your door type situation

826
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
They knocked

827
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Was that like

828
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
Pretty terrifying

829
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,392
You know what's up what's going to happen to me what's going to happen next

830
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
What did happen

831
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
I don't know how much of that I can

832
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Talk about

833
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
But

834
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
I did

835
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
Cooperate with the government

836
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
And I have cooperated with them for the last

837
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
5 + years now

838
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,216
Is a kick in the butt so you know my parents

839
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
Kind of kicked me out not. Kicked me hours

840
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Assisted me with a rapid move out

841
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
I've been living on my own

842
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Stan and

843
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Became gainfully employed

844
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Had a few jobs

845
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,744
Became a little more serious with my my then-girlfriend who is now my wife

846
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
So

847
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,608
You know it's give me an opportunity over the last five years to really

848
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
Make some serious changes to my life

849
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
Meanwhile over the same five years darkhold grew into

850
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
And it's massive

851
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Cybercriminals swap meet

852
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Where tens of thousands of stolen social

853
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Security numbers were bought and sold

854
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
Huge database of personal information and emails were bought and sold malware and software various kinds are bought and sold and

855
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,696
Punta Cana temple-raston right up until

856

July 15th

857
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Of this year

858
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
July 15th

859
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
2015

860
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
Today marks

861
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,144
In our efforts to bring to Justice some of the most significant

862
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,984
Cyber criminals in the world ended up happening on July 15th

863
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,104
Is that the FBI actually got into dark hole with a number of intelligent service

864
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
System around the world

865
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
And they had an 18-month

866
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
Investigation in which they took

867
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Down

868
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
In the end

869
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
28 people

870
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Effectively

00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,672
And we are in the process of rounding up

872
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
And charging the Hornets

873
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,536

874
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
More than two dozen people
