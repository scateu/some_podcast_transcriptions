What you did

26
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
I just thought it would be a weird thing to do

27
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
Yeah I was like well that would be weird we don't know if it's funny but

28
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,296
We try it out so is it going to be weird will do it

29
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Is it going to alienate half the audience

30
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Thank you so much images to send things up a do better

31
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496

Medians

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
That's it

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
We first heard about the bet you're about to hear from Jesse thorn

35
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,504
Host of The Sound of Young America

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Okay check my phone okay yeah

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
So much so you sit up when curtain Kristen walk onstage what happened well there's a couple of jokes

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
What's up top

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
You know they joke about this this TV show that they hosted in the 70s

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Courthouse

41
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
I did explain the American judicial system was canceled immediately

42
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
And so the audience is kind of laughing at the jokes

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Thanking my call this is going to be a regular comedy sketch

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Invent

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
They go into this song

46
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
Does this

47
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Maniacal singing and clapping in Christian is doing this horsey dance

48
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
Can you do this before in like why

49
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
After the third repetition people laugh

50
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Maybe they get it like oh they can just going to do that and then somewhere around like forever on the 4th time

51
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
It's not really not funny

52
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
Quiet. I'm done with that I'm done I don't want to watch this anymore why are they still doing

53
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,903
And then and then that changes

54
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Factual hatred

55
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
Stupid people you to stupid people but somewhere between like

56
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
9 + 11

57
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Then they then they're like a like these

58
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
You get this next level which they can't continue

59
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
And then they do continue doing it

60
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
You really their eyes are starting to cross

61
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,663
Dripping sweat christened angry that I've gone that long

62
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
I mean you can hear it in that thing like losing track of the song because he's going to

63
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Dentist on Tiger Woods today

64
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
I've have Catherine stage whisper

65
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
Stop it

66
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Baby my favorite thing in the history of the world

67
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
What I love about it is

68
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,559
Your brain is trying to make it into what you wanted to be which is a joke

69
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
But there is no joke happening and sowed what these two people are doing is creating the expectation

70
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
The expectation is going to be broken

71
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
But then breaking that expectation that the expectation is going to be broken by just delivering the thing that they've been delivering over

72
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
4 and over for the past 10 minutes what's the longest you take it

73
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
10 minutes

74
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
In Australia

75
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
You were drunk

76
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Yeah

77
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,927
It seems like it seem like 10 minutes at we can't be sure

78
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,791
You if it was 10 minutes it seems like there's no way 10 minutes 10 minutes

79
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
And the audience

80
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
When

81
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Crazy

82
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod

83
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
I've never told it

84
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,207
This is Radiolab and today today is all about

85
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
Things that happen over and over

86
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Scare you

87
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
Hooks and loops

88
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
The incomplete you

89
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
So weird where are you guys

90
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
San Francisco bus you're not in Texas

91
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
Now just sounds like where in Texas can you guys actually just if you don't mind

92
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Yourself so we know

93
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
We have your name and all that shirt and Mary Sue Campbell

94
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
I live in Novato California

95
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
And my daughter Christine is

96
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
30 years old I live in

97
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
In San Francisco

98
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
And I was raised in the bottom in the house set

99
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
Said this couldn't have been that Shall We Begin

100
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
Okay tell me the beginning How The Story start

101
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
I

102
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
It was odd Christine actually call me Tuesday morning about

103
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
10

104
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
And just said what are you doing Mom and said oh I'm just going to go out in the yard and do some yard work and run some errands

105
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
How to do the yard work early because

106
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Going to be hot today

107
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,823
Now it's wearing in the summertime August 24th and apparently

108
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
What 10 minutes later half hour later

109
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Cheese

110
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
Said I called her she had left me a voicemail

111
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Something like

112
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
Hey Christine it's Mom something

113
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Something's not right

114
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Something's wrong

115
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
I need you to call me back

116
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
So I gave her a call back and

117
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
And she said

118
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
At something about the house isn't right there

119
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Things look weird in here

120
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
What's weird what what are you talking about

121
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
And then she said

122
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
One looking at the calendar and it says August 2010

123
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
And I'm like

124
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Aha

125
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
That he's like

126
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Well that's not right and I said

127
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Well yes it is

128
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,343
August 24th 2010 and as soon as I said that out loud I grabbed my purse

129
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Talev

130
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Oh my God she's had a stroke that was my

131
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
My my first reaction and

132
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Oh that makes me feel emotional

133
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
And so

134
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:46,495
Christine said she walked out of her house to the car keeping your mom on the phone

135
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
All the while your mom's telling her one thing after another just doesn't look right

136
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
She says there's a strange black

137
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Truck on the driveway

138
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Which is the truck that belongs to her boyfriend that has been parked there for 10 years

139
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
And of course the increasingly I mean I'm just

140
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Freaking out at

141
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
So she hangs up with her mom and then calls the paramedics

142
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
And a half hour later Christine

143
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Arrives at the house

144
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
By the time I walked in she had been there

145
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
For 5 or 10 minutes at the most

146
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
As soon as I walked in the doctor greeted me and said

147
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
This is her doctor Jonathan Vallejo

148
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Christine

149
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
It's immediately evident

150
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
It's not a stroke

151
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
Not an infection that's that's a huge relief but I said

152
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Your mother has has

153
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
Transient global amnesia Global transient

154
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
I'll be honest with you I had no idea what that meant

155
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
I think the word I heard the most was Amnesia your mother has

156
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Lost her ability

157
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
The Forum

158
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
New memory

159
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Can't remember but

160
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
It's not going to last

161
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Last forever

162
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
It usually last

163
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Between 1 and 24 hours and we're not sure what

164
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
At this point where the story goes from something kind of frightening

165
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
Something a little more surreal

166
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah so when I came in mother is sitting up in bed and

167
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
She immediately started asking questions

168
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Tuesday

169
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
August 24th

170
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Of course we have a video on YouTube

171
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
My birthday

172
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
I'm trying to remember the last date I remember

173
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Yeah

174
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,735
We hung out you came over to my house and we watched a video that I made for you and I was in Texas

175
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
And all your sisters and

176
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
Your brother said happy birthday to you on the video but we still have the video again but you're going to remember

177
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
They say it's just temporary

178
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Here at home

179
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Yep you're at home

180
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Jackson gardening and you called me and you're feeling confused

181
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Call the paramedics

182
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
I can come and get you

183
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
And we came here

184
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Stepped on you

185
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
What's the date

186
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
August 24th

187
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Tuesday

188
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
I'm trying to remember the last

189
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Read and remember

190
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
You don't remember my birthday

191
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Yeah couple weeks ago

192
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Name I missed it but

193
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
This conversation they're having

194
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Just started over

195
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
Because every 90 seconds Mary Sue's memory reset

196
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:29,055
What's strange the repetition like we started that last clip you heard with her saying this

197
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
90 seconds later after her memory reset she says

198
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Seconds later

199
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Remember

200
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
The last

201
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Read and remember miss you watch this video for a few minutes you realize What's Happening Here is it Mary Sue

202
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Is in a loop

203
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
It goes like this

204
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
First the date

205
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
What's the date

206
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
August 24th

207
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
She didn't respond

208
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,847
In almost the same way every time

209
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Yep

210
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
And every time she says that

211
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Darn in exactly the same way it was

212
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Fast forward

213
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
If I pass my birthday

214
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,695
You must enjoy your birthday quite a bit then she laughs

215
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
NBA recap

216
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
You're working in the gardens and you gave me a call I'm just saying it's usually when she says the word paramedic

217
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Call the paramedics

218
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
And had them come and pick you up

219
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,055
The Mary Sue's eyes get really wide in this look of sheer

220
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Butter

221
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Disbelief isn't that creepy I mean every single time

222
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
Weepy 90 seconds later

223
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Is stomach sleeping

224
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
90 seconds later

225
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Repeat itself at this point

226
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Right after creepy

227
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Pachira sets

228
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
Okay so I don't know what day it is

229
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:02,495
Like somebody put it on rewind over and over and over again

230
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
I had repeated the birthday so much

231
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
That the nurse

232
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
Apparently was behind me now doing the words my birthday

233
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Groundhog's Day

234
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
We're doing a little yes we do that we have had the same conversation over and over again

235
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,583
Two and a half hours

236
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Danny Phantom

237
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
That is what we're talking about today

238
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
What day is it

239
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Tuesday

240
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
August 24th

241
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
You didn't miss that you were there

242
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Watching it

243
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
I wanted to slap me

244
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
I want to bring it out and let me inside

245
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Damn it I just

246
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Told you that for the record you would never see my mother. I know she would.

247
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
This is a person who's lost

248
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Commemorate

249
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
But why would her

250
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Heath

251
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Once I go to the next piece soap

252
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Precisely and cancer

253
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Systole the same

254
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Exactly the same

255
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
DIY

256
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
I think what it is is one of the things nurses said

257
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,783
Is that when you have something like this your true self

258
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Comes out

259
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Huh

260
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Your true the word true isn't

261
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,255
I think so yeah

262
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
Oh yeah I mean I got my mom through and through right there made

263
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
What Christine means is not the repetition

264
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,751
But their mom keeps asking so many questions just wants to know what's going on with with all

265
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Across-the-board I love

266
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Problems I love

267
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Puzzles

268
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,943
Are you like a sudoku fiend you know

269
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
I am I am I hate to admit this God

270
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Iplate escape room games

271
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
On the internet

272
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,231
Escape room what are those they're stupid little games where they have little hidden pixels that you find

273
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
You're you're stuck in a room and you have to get out

274
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Got to find the key to the door

275
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
And there's all these little

276
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,775
Hidden places is the perfect escape room

277
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
There's a different way of saying this

278
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,271
First of all Jonathan blajos that ER doctor who seen a bunch of these cases

279
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,647
He said well that Puzzler Instinct that's not just marysue what everybody does

280
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Is

281
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Struggle over and over again

282
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Where am I

283
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
And when

284
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Just a brain in survival mode

285
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
And another thing that everybody does

286
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
You see about six of these patients so far is it everybody

287
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Not just Mary Sue but everybody

288
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
The Lee comes a broken record

289
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Right down to the

290
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Phrasing of the sentences

291
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Which keeps them out a little

292
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,783
Admit you to make sure the brain seemed a little bit more like

293
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,879
A machine you know you give the machine exact same set of input

294
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
Every 90 seconds given the same doctor the same hospital room

295
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Steeping machines

296
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,351
See if the output never varies and it does

297
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
It almost seems like the patient

298
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Has no free well

299
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
And so sometimes

300
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
In the back of his head he thinks

301
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,895
Thought if I had that condition at someone videotape me

302
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
I would love to see

303
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
See my own tape

304
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Why you know I think

305
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
I want to see

306
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Could I somehow ask

307
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Or or would I would I end up

308
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
End up with the rest of us

309
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,399
Now thankfully according to Jonathan what normally happens in this condition is that as time goes on. 92nd

310
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,727
Lutz starts to slowly expand more like 2 minutes

311
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Soar 3 minutes eventually 4 minutes

312
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Now it's 5 minutes into a Mary Sue after a few hours at our Loop got longer and longer old memories

313
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Start to creep back in

314
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,039
By that evening she was remembering up until

315
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Like that Sunday

316
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,695
Few hours later her memory began to extend into Monday morning

317
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
She remembered Monday night

318
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
And then

319
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
Finally Shall We Begin

320
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Tell me the beginning

321
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
How The Story start

322
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
I

323
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
It was odd Christine actually call me Tuesday morning about

324
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,639
I just said you doing Mom and apparently

325
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
I'm a village from Jen

326
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
Message

327
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839

00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,783
Mrs Mary Sue Campbell here we go more information about loan at www

331
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
Loan. Org

332
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
And this message

333
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,999
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

334
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,119
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

335
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,519
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

336
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

337
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
A kid you know did something

338
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

339
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

340
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

341
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,983
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

342
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

343
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
Anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

344
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

345
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,855
Record a short audio message for us

346
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,183

Thank you so much

348
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,663
Hey I'm Jenna Radiolab and this hour we're talking about loops loops loops

349
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
Okay

350
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Nothing

351
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,367
Is 1.0 is the obviously

352
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Panda sleep shaping

353
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Palliative y00

354
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
Who's this this is Alex Bellos tonight

355
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Here's looking at Euclid

356
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
When I was a kid I used to think

357
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
A 06 Tahoe with nothing in it

358
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
But actually zero

359
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Chosen by the Indians

360
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
That's kind of reflecting

361
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
The Eternal cycle of the phases of Heaven

362
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Raymond's

363
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,503
The Greeks and the Jews

364
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
We going to have a zero

365
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,087
We just had units. Everything started at 1

366
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
One reason why we didn't

367
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Is that

368
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
I'm kind of afraid of The Voice

369
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,376
Afraid of the Void

370
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
How would you describe something

371
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
It isn't there

372
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Nothing

373
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,920
There's nothing to say yeah it's an emptiness

374
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,552
Anna nothing is in a means you're so long you don't even know where you are a psychological

375
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,136
Barrett's was grasping the zero in India

376
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,024
Everything and nothing was the same thing that have the first of the fluidity and then growls decided that nothing this was something

377
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,352
And I'm leaving the way they decided to represent the nothing

378
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,984
What is a piece of nothing and they drew a circle around it which turns the nothing

379
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
And do something

380
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Alexa Loop

381
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
So

382
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,016
This idea of Eternity in continuity and infinity is actually contained with

383
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
The onion evil

384
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Cut50

385
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
My Kind of Love

386
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
God damn it was actually his

387
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
One of the most mystical

388
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Magical

389
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Parrot show

390
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
Digit of that mole

391
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
We use everyday

392
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
So here's to other Workhorse

393
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Next up

394
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,736
A story from reporter Mark Phillips right

395
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
As you can see here there

396
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
All these containers

397
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Tape Bluetooth

398
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
Okay set this up who is this guy

399
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
His name is William basinski

400
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
He's a musician who makes this

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
Really hard to describe music

402
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,424
I'm doing it for about 30 years and basically what he does is

403
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
He take a little bit of

404
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
Classical music or music

405
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Recorded on tape

406
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Analog tape

407
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Terrible and he looped

408
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
If I can find some

409
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,576
He cuts the beginning the end keeps it together into a circle brezza through tape machine

410
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Speed and you get something that sounds like this

411
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
This little phrase that just repeats over and over and over again and never

412
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
Changes oops her everywhere their Cycles there in nature there just universe

413
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
And if you can find a loop that can repeat without becoming redundant

414
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Then you can sort of fall into a different space and time it open

415
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
Sort of like a bubble of Eternity or something I don't know

416
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
So that's what that's how

417
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
Well in the summer of 2001

418
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
I was

419
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
Archiving all these old tape loops

420
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Transferring them

421
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
2 digit

422
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,504
And something kind of weird happened you grab this one piece of tape put it on

423
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
And it was so

424
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Wonderful grave

425
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Very stately

426
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Lupine

427
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
Totally forgot

428
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
Can I set it up and turn down the

429
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Garnerin

430
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
Left the control room went to the kitchen.

431
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Coffee

432
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
Came back and

433
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:50,176
Started realizing something was changing

434
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
I love to see that

435
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,576
The tape was

436
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
Shredding

437
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
The thing to understand about tape

438
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,792
Is that when you record music onto analog tape onto a bit of it

439
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,096
That music but it is it's

440
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Iron oxide powder glue

441
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Did just a piece of plastic

442
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
So the iron powder is

443
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
Actually the music but after 20-30 years

444
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
The glue loses its strength in the

445
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
Just falls off

446
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
On the floor

447
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,344
His music is actually falling on the floor and I thought of my God was going to happen

448
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,928
What happened was in the course of about an hour

449
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
The music

450
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
You put more loops on and it kept happening

451
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
But the really interesting thing was

452
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,472
While some disintegrated quickly some slowly

453
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
They all sort of had the same

454
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Pattern

455
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
What do you mean

456
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Just listen to this one

457
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
So this is one of those loops

458
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
At the beginning

459
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
And after went around and around 4:20

460
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,584
Minutes or so the dust are the fall off and then it sounded like this

461
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,320
All the all the notes are still there

462
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
But the tales are getting shorter

463
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah and that's what always happens

464
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
Sustains and decays of the notes seem to fall away like from the back

465
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
Moving

466
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
Backwards backwards

467
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
It gets shorter and shorter instead of being held for 4 seconds help for 3 seconds

468
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
2 second

469
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,160
Finally just really here

470
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Like the attacks in the

471
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Just the beginning for the notes

472
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Only the beginning

473
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Hold on

474
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
At least for a little while

475
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
I was

476
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
Thinking wow this is like

477
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
I'm recording

478
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
The life and death

479
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Have a melody

480
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
It just made me think of

481
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Human beings

482
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
How we

483
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Die

484
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
You can really hear that

485
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Disintegration on this particular

486
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
Number 5 it starts sounding like the rest like this

487
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
But after

488
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Just 15 minutes

489
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Basically completely gone

490
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
And the tape on this one

491
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
You know tape is normally Brown

492
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Right now it's

493
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Clear

494
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
Big Scotch tape

495
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
The dust is gone

496
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Little bit of brown here

497
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Announce

498
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Clear

499
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
It's almost all gone

500
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,104
This next group is is a Sly one and you're going to have to wait for it loopiness

501
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Kick in

502
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Ready

503
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Born Ready

504
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Pretty single Navy

505
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,600
The smell of a dead whale as you have to experience the note to know what it's like it's like nothing I've ever smelled

506
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Does Craig Smith

507
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Professor of Ocean Ave

508
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Giants really

509
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Putrid

510
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Back when Craig was a grudge

511
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,560
This is a 1982

512
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Putting off the coast of San Diego

513
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
About a third of the water was

514
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Supersonic picking at it

515
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
How big

516
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Around 25 to 30 feet long

517
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,152
So is that like a train car more like a size of a small yacht I guess

518
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
Freaking well I wanted to think that well studied

519
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,880
What happens when a whale sinks of the seafloor people just speculated about it's anyone ever followed it down to the bottom

520
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
No one is followed the well down to the bottom

521
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,120
So we we told the carcass out to see and they had all these little scraps of Steel

522
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
That they tied to the whale's tail one at a time about 2000 pounds

523
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
And

524
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Nothing

525
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
It wasn't enough to

526
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
Just think the whale whale kept sitting there like Biggs

527
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
Smelly balloon

528
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Awful decomposition of gas and the captain of the ship goes well

529
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
IPhone

530
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
This also doesn't work doesn't really do anything

531
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
The Craig try it again and again and eventually

532
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Not with that well but with others

533
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
You got to see something

534
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
So cool

535
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
So a whale dies and sinks down into the the dark

536
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
And and then

537
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
This incredible cycle begins within minutes

538
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
Scavengers will be at the carcass

539
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,360
They smell within hours but may well have hundreds of hagfish on it

540
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
They're terrified you like animals

541
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
They have grinding plates instead of teeth and they burrow into the carcass

542
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:26,720
Hundreds like a hagfish conventions really massive of heels what is that look like well it looks like

543
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
Like I'm a giant Medusa head

544
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
Over the next few days a bunch of other scavengers show up including

545
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Stone crab shrimp feast gud dark station

546
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Flash flying everywhere

547
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
Sometimes the hagfish get ticked off and they tried to defend their territory very interesting ability to

548
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:59,744
Reduce mucus you can put a couple of hagfish into a bucket of water and

549
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
Kick it and I can produce enough mucus to essentially turn the bucket of water into

550
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,496
Nothing like gelatin wow just like Medusa head in a cloud of mucus and all that is just the first

551
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Stage the mobile scavenger stage

552
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Okay

553
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
So what happens after that

554
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
Well after the mobile scavenger stage

555
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,064
Is Ben Richmond opportunist 8

556
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
The whale

557
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
Is beginning to look pretty dilapidated little bits of

558
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
Well soft tissue implanted in the seafloor and so the ground around the whale becomes like

559
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,448
Start of its own little ecosystem

560
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
A bunch of new animals show up there worms

561
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
Are there really little worms like tons of them we can we can get 30 or 40 thousand of them per square meter

562
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,088
Sometimes the sentiment around a whale fall looks like

563
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
A lot of grass for these worms I just wriggling sticking up out of the settlement and

564
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,840
Waving back and forth these worms

565
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Tinker White

566
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,216
Sofia the White Worm like grass

567
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
Ghostly

568
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
And finally

569
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Glass stage something we call the sulfur loving stage

570
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
At this point the whale looks like a skeleton

571
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,840
Covered with this actually beautiful mad of white bacteria

572
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
5 minutes

573
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
Fluffy and just looks like a polar bear's fur

574
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Covering the bones of the whale

575
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Yeah

576
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,896
Think about a whale skeleton draped in a polar bear fur coat

577
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,248
Sulfur's coming out of the bones and the bacteria or just clustering around

578
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Picking it up

579
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,416
4 years

580
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
When you step back and look at it

581
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:23,104
These dead whales may become like planet and you find creatures living on them

582
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
That you don't find anywhere else

583
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
There now about

584
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
55 species

585
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
That haven't been found in any other habitats

586
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
Species of animals that only live on well fall

587
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Does that mean that these creatures

588
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
Like the whale is their entire world they don't know anything else

589
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
For some of them yeah

590
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Where they do

591
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
The rest of time in this can't happen that often

592
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Well

593
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
That's a good question maybe that they are living is what we fugitive species in other words

594
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Drift around

595
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Waiting

596
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Can I say hoping

597
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
4

598
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:08,928
And when that happens they grow quickly produce

599
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
Hundreds thousands maybe even millions of RV that they then broadcast out into the water column

600
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
The darkness

601
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Waiting

602
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,848
Until she will find another such habitat

603
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
Hundreds of kilometers away

604
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
And repeat

605
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
So altogether how long can

606
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Can a whale fall last

607
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Well I well for Ken last

608
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,280
A large whale skeleton that of a blue large blue whale or fin whale

609
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,864
Can support a community for 50 to 75 years

610
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
Which really

611
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
Astana de and how does that compare to the lifespan of a whale

612
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616
Well it's probably pretty comprable actually whales live

613
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
By the order of

614
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
5270 years

615
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,808
Something kind of poetic about that the idea that you know for the same amount of time that the whale live

616
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
It's going to support this

617
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Life

618
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah it is it is very

619
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Appealing

620
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
This is Radiolab

621
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
This is Radiolab

622
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,280
Today were talking about loops I'm Robert krulwich run

623
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Is Radiolab it's all about Luke

624
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
Yep I'm Chad, I'm Robert you're listening to Radiolab today were talking about Luke and it's all about

625
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,104
I'm jamming Robert like my lips and speaking things that happen over and over and over again

626
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Hello.

627
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
Hi Jad paste

628
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Steve Stephens

629
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
How are you

630
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
How's it going I'm good and Steve told us a story about a mathematical Loop

631
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
The through mathematicians all over the world far

632
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,512
Story starts way back with a guy named got LOB frigga

633
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
Got La brega how do you spell yeah it's not it's not Gottlieb its it seems to be lob at the end

634
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
Typo in every book I've ever seen

635
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,848
Not to set this up very quickly God was a mathematician back in the eighteen seventies and eighties any had a dream

636
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Mathematics could unlock

637
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
The secrets

638
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,784
That you could maybe even build a machine beaded some basic mathematical rule

639
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
And it would just start

640
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Churning out

641
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Discovery

642
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,976
When you need a human being that's how powerful he thought math could be a question if math

643
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Is the most fundamental thing in the universe

644
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
What is the most fundamental Park

645
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
Map what's at the foundation is it numbers is it

646
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
In a 1-2-3 that's what you would think

647
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,800
But God love you said no there's a deeper thing the number

648
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
The deepest thing of all is

649
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Is what today we call Seth

650
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
The set

651
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Of things

652
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
You know so

653
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
Yes I like what's a set

654
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,088
Steve explain it to us using all things

655
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Sesame Street

656
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Really old episodes

657
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Far is it to set it up here at

658
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
Two people working at

659
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
The furry Arms Hotel there's Humphrey who's got a green nose and a pink face and his

660
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
Girlfriend

661
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
I actually know what she

662
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
She might be his wife Ingrid

663
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Cancel their hotel

664
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,800
Keepers and Ernie is in the background

665
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
Dan Humphrey are taking an order

666
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
Room service order from a room full of penguins

667
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
You know Humphrey says I'll take your order

668
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,880
Mr. penguin sir

669
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
Spanish Spanish

670
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
Dan Humphrey said let me check if I got that right

671
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Fish fish fish

672
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Fish fish

673
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,728
And then he calls over to Ingrid he's going to call it in to the kitchen so he tells Ingrid

674
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Fish fish

675
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,824
Fish fish fish fish fish fish

676
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Fish fish

677
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,664
No that's not right

678
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,992
Paseo Pointe says A5 times but then

679
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Journey explained

680
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Excuse me

681
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Ingrid and Humphrey

682
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
I have a better way for you to do this

683
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
A better way

684
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
Count the fish

685
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
6 fish

686
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,752
They both realize Ingrid and Humphrey how powerful this is in they say does it work for

687
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
Say cinnamon roll

688
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Spark plugs

689
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Absolutely

690
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,968
That's the point that what's cinnamon buns and spark plugs and fish the sets

691
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
Have in common is that there are six in each

692
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,112
I mean if you try to say what is 6 really mean it

693
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
It's the thing that those sets have in common

694
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
According to Steve it's not so much the number

695
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
Sick that's important here again that's the label

696
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
For this characteristic that all these piles seem to share it's the pilot itself the set that is

697
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,264
The most basic things

698
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,872
Shapes are the Bedrock I've been looking for that we can build the rest of math

699
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
On top of it yeah and I can make my meth machine that the Universe and I think he published a book sort of shell

700
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
Knowing how this might work

701
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,880
Except that Russell Bertrand Musselman application

702
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Then found a

703
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
Devastating Paradox that ended up

704
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,096
Well annihilating what to do

705
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,960
Russell's Paradox is now become known as the barber paradox

706
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
In this case the set is

707
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Account

708
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Atomic people

709
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,664
Yep one Barber with the following in this town the barber shaves everyone

710
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
Who doesn't shave himself

711
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
The bar

712
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,600
Who doesn't shave himself to some people save himself some people go to the barber

713
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:03,488
That's the universe we're in a town where everyone who doesn't shave himself is shaving by this Barber and now the question is

714
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
Who shaves the barber

715
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
2

716
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
Remember the barber the barber has the property that he shaves everyone who doesn't shave himself so he can shave himself

717
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
But on the other hand

718
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,336
He doesn't shave himself

719
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
Then he's one of those people who doesn't shave himself and is therefore shaving by the bar put maybe the barber here's to solutions for you guys

720
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
Barber cut not shave

721
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Could you just not shave

722
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
Nino or Maybelline Township maybe he could set up some sort of mechanical device that sort of like one of them

723
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
Can't do that you can't change that answer sensibly what happens to the barber and no one has there's nothing to say

724
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,960
Either does or doesn't shave himself by ordinary Aristotelian logic

725
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Because the barber

726
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,080
Can't shave himself and he can't not shave himself

727
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
So

728
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,783
So there's something to it ruined that's what ruined the machine that would solve the universe

729
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
Afternoon to wait for a couple hours like after lunch before you go swimming but I can't see that by overthrowing

730
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,583
All lights work but does it does it turns out to be a very very problematic for the foundations

731
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
The map

732
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Cuz what does barber paradox

733
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
The reason was so annoying to mathematicians was that

734
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
Math is supposed to be this logical

735
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
Thing right

736
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
Logic is the lifeblood of Matt and you here

737
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
You had this little bit of math

738
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,991
It was a logical a cell. Contradict contradicting

739
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
Set with Bertrand Russell that I came up with all this

740
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,879
He didn't lose Faith he's all of this is just a problem with set theory

741
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
So then he spent a long time trying to make

742
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,255
A theory I think he called it a theory of types

743
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
Instead of sets

744
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
These he had certain admission rules that he thought would prevent paradoxes from happening

745
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,287
Under Bertrand Russell system it was no logical problems no paradoxes

746
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Until it's gone evil German guy comes along and you say his name

747
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,783
I don't speak German but

748
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
Mathematicians often say it like the woman

749
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:10,975
Piece of clothing you know from the old days

750
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Google

751
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,423
Jana down 11 she has written a book about good and I'm up

752
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
Professor physics and astronomy

753
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
Barnard college she says the point at which Goodwill enters our story it's 1930s Vienna Austria

754
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Recently finished his

755
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,943
What would be equivalent to like a doctoral degree a peach

756
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,039
HD smart people around him understood

757
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
But he was also maybe

758
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Little bit off he had real brakes

759
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Swift you know

760
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Reality he was

761
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,231
In the biography said call him a paranoid schizophrenic

762
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
But he seems more kind of

763
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
Obsessive

764
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,655
Depressive I don't know but

765
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,519
But he was in and out of sanatoria and and and he had real difficulties

766
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,359
Being sure what was real the only reality he really trusted

767
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,407
With math circle shapes

768
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,503
Prime numbers formulas axioms he got into paradoxes

769
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,623
Perhaps if the barber paradox the Lord The Men We don't know but he began to think about an actual experiment with

770
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Some of these

771
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Paradoxical loops

772
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
He took something like the Paradox of the liar

773
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
Turn off the light or says

774
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
This statement is a lie

775
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
This statement is a lie

776
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Right

777
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,959
If it's true then it's false

778
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
And if it's false then it's true

779
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Statement is a lie

780
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
If you think about that too much

781
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:35,455
You might try to cuddle with interested in that phrase and

782
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
For various reasons he took it

783
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,807
Tweaked a little bit to come up with the following statement

784
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
This

785
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,391
Statement is unprovable

786
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Which is very important to notice if it's

787
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
If it's provable

788
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Then

789
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,327
It's Unforgivable.

790
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:56,191
Forget words what would happen if I converted this statement into math

791
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,591
Because in math things are either provable or unprovable they cannot be both at the same time as other true

792
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Or false if it's true

793
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,783
Damn it you should be able to prove it yeah so he said I'm going to assign a special number unique number

794
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,087
To make that a purely mathematical statement

795
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
By coating it in a very clever way into arithmetic

796
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
To be honest

797
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Very very clever

798
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
He did his Matthew stuff

799
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,423
Had a rigorous mathematical statement right there on the page he looked at it and you realize that what he just

800
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
In math

801
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
Is it the following statement

802
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
This

803
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Statement is unprovable

804
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Is it's true

805
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,663
Because it's actually unprovable meaning

806
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
In math

807
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
Which statement actually is unprovable because it is true the logic of

808
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
Math will not let you prove that it is

809
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Trousseau might be true

810
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
What's never know nothing like that is supposed to happen in math things are supposed to be true or not true and you supposed to be able to prove

811
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,887
Every true thing that stays up

812
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
If there's something true that you

813
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Improve

814
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,239
That means that the math

815
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
Strangely

816
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:08,127
Alphalete

817
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
It's always called his incompleteness the

818
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,807
That's the phrase the Godel incompleteness theorem is that if you have a system of axioms that are

819
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Consistent

820
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
Meaning they don't contradict themselves

821
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
They're necessarily incomplete

822
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,231
That is there a certain statements you can make

823
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
Within that system that you can't prove or disprove

824
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
And all of math has this character

825
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
This is the big shock that this is not just about word games about

826
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
Logic puzzles with Barbara This Is Us

827
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
Devastating for even just

828
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Counting

829
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
41234

830
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,943
Another word math is shot through and through

831
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,527
With these kind of statements that you can't either prove or disprove

832
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,391
Seriously the Deep thinkers at the time were amazed at this it was recognized as

833
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
One of the great ideas of

834
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
Of the twentieth century for sure maybe of all time

835
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:04,959
Maybe I should make it more concrete there's a question that as far as I know it's still not solved

836
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,799
Steve gave us this example of a problem something called gold box

837
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Conjecture

838
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
Kind of gives you a sense of what incompleteness

839
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Feels like

840
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,967
So goldbach's conjecture says that you can always right

841
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
Any even number as a sum of two prime number

842
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
So let me give you some

843
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
That likes a

844
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
12

845
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,999
Yeah, remember for sale prime number means you can / 1 and by itself

846
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
The prime numbers

847
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
1 and 7 but nothing else

848
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,935
All right. Well which isn't even number is 7 + 5

849
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Desert

850
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
Another one help out

851
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
24

852
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
What's 11 + 30

853
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Or

854
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
36

855
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
19 + 7

856
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,135
Any even number now this has been checked out to I don't know what billions trillions

857
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,719
Maybe hundreds of trillions so no one has ever found a counterexample

858
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Apple II Gold box

859
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
Conjecture and here's the thing

860
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
You might think that either it's true

861
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Or it's false

862
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
It might be

863
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
That

864
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
This statement

865
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Every

866
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
Even number is the sum of two prime it might be neither

867
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Crew Norfolk

868
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,407
But what we today call undecidable

869
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,527
Undecidable is a term that comes from gradle

870
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
I mean suppose in some

871
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Ethereal

872
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
Are transcendental sense

873
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Like that is

874
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
Suppose that there's God and God knows that this is

875
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,095
Then you know what about us here among the world of human being

876
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,655
All we can do is check each

877
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
Even number

878
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
Every time we check it

879
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,287
True with that that would never constitute a proof

880
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Because we've never run out of numbers

881
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
You then say

882
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
You got to understand everything

883
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
You either

884
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,343
Have to defer to God who doesn't attend everything if you believe in God but if you don't believe in God

885
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,671
You didn't have to live with mystery and not knowing

886
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
That's all you can say

887
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:09,119
I'm going to say yes I think you've been capsulated a perfectly and I think that

888
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
Girdle himself

889
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Was

890
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
I think a believer in all kinds of mystical things

891
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,591
Like it's for him this was very freeing and liberating because it meant that there were

892
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
That we couldn't be mechanized

893
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,431
There was profound mystery forever

894
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
Coca-Cola

895
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,367
I'm on your team here but me just point on something

896
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
GoNoodle when he died

897
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
He was not exactly liberated he was a paranoid

898
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
Like he thought people trying to poison him he's starving self to that he was exactly liberated but I choose to believe

899
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
It's somewhere in his tortured mind and

900
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
This is my mother

901
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Pretty torture

902
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
There was a little fellow humming

903
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
The song a song

904
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Liberation

Problems

907
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,439
Thanks to Steve strogatz she has a new book

908
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Called

909
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,047
Infinite Powers how calculus reveals the secrets of the universe

910
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,143
And also thanks to Janna Levin her book about doodle is called

911
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,959
A Madman dreams of Turing machines

912
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
And finally our last

913
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:30,527
Lupe's yeah this one like the last one involves things feeding back on themselves

914
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Kind of

915
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
Like a classic positive feedback loop

916
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Which is what exactly was like when you can do with audio you take a speaker in a mic you put the feed the sound from the speaker into the mic and

917
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:46,143
Speaking into the mic X the most liked and then you get something like

918
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,471
Painful is painful but

919
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,287
That kind of feedback loop like in the case of her neck story

920
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
Can also

921
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Take the pain away

922
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,359
Yes

923
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,991
Comes to us from this lady I Melanie thernstrom is a writer the author of a book on pain called the

924
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
Pain Chronicles which is a book

925
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,855
That began as a chronicling of her own pain

926
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,439
Which has been suffering from every day for the last 15 years

927
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
And what sort of pain

928
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,279
Om pain in my neck

929
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,583
And right shoulder and right side of my head

930
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
All at once

931
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
Yeah Yeah Yeahs

932
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,983
Start with something that you hid it there how did it start

933
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
It didn't start with an injury of any

934
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
Kind but it is Friday discrete

935
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:31,199
Time goes back to 1997 she was Upstate New York at a country house

936
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,783
On a date with our first date and I wanted to impress him

937
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,343
So I swam across of

938
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
Pond by the mile across

939
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
Is this your idea or was it his idea

940
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
It was my idea

941
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
Wow that's a different kind of fish that

942
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
And you made it all the way there and back

943
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Yes

944
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
And nothing happened

945
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
But that night

946
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
What you got in the bed

947
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,519
I was kept awake by this strange burning sensation in my

948
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Shoulder

949
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
Knack

950
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
I didn't get that

951
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
That

952
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Head pain

953
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
Like four more years

954
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
And that

955
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Testicular pain

956
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
Never went away and got worse

957
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Time

958
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,183
I'm burning so it's like a nerve a nerve was

959
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Yeah I mean

960
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,047
Eventually I got an MRI

961
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Couple years later

962
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
And there was none

963
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Impingement knife

964
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Binance

965
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,215
She says she's tried everything

966
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Drugs in

967
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
Physical Therapy shoes

968
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,103
Distraction like I'll go to a matinee and if it's

969
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Scary movie

970
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
I just don't stay full

971
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,271
Focus on the pain to distract you can work but then she says as soon as she gets out of the movie

972
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Its back

973
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
And it's angry

974
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
For being ignored

975
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
Sensation

976
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Like that.

977
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Right

978
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
Side of my head

979
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Dying Light

980
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,375
React not

981
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,447
Image with kayak frighten me

982
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,775
Find it that thought would make the pain worse

983
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
And making the pain worse

984
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Will

985
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
Inspire further negative fantasy

986
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
Which will make

987
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
Inspiremore fantasies

988
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,975
Positive feedback loop

989
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Negative

990
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,839
And eventually Melanie's the decided okay I'm going to write a book about this

991
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Do some research

992
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,167
I was reading a lot about

993
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,215
Self-inflicted pain in religious

994
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
And I actually went to witness

995
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Hindi fast

996
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,871
How to say I'm in Kuala Lumpur

997
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,175
What she saw a really changed your mind about things

998
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,503
You can see video of this Festival on YouTube

999
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,087
What you see is a dense crowd

1000
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
Doing insane acts of devotion literally like

1001
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
Read needles through their tongue

1002
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Irritated cheeks

1003
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Weighted Fish House

1004
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
Daniel from their back

1005
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,007
And yet she says when she would look in their faces they seemed

1006
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Relax

1007
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
Really relaxed

1008
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
Was it just that they were

1009
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,783
Already in the pants actually seemed like they weren't

1010
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
At all

1011
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
And I would think

1012
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Okay

1013
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:25,535
This person here has a skewer in his mouth

1014
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
You know you can't

1015
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Become

1016
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,399
A religious Hindi in order

1017
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
To experience this

1018
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
Analgesic penerbit like that's cheating but I did feel like okay to one way to describe

1019
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,895
I bet it stays but for every

1020
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
Wavy fan

1021
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Describing religion

1022
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
There's also a way you can

1023
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,575
Describe things in in scientific terms

1024
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,879
And the reality is all of our pain

1025
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
Is in our head

1026
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:56,511
Which means it's this guy this is Sean Mackey chief of the Stanford pain management division

1027
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:01,375
He will tell you that one of the most basic facts about pain is it is not purely physical

1028
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
We've got

1029
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,215
Signals coming up from the body they're sending sms

1030
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:11,871
Like if you whack a toe the signal shoots up some nerves in your leg into your spine and those signals converge Ann Arbor

1031
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,015
Before you even feel a thing there are multitude of what I refer to as little amplifier throughout our brain

1032
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
The turn up and turn down

1033
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
The overall pain experience

1034
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,439
Annie's amplifiers are things like your mood

1035
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
Anxiety depression

1036
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,279
Attention expectations all of these things

1037
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,375
Feedback on to that signal coming up from the body and they can either boosted

1038
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,191
Papa past a certain point where

1039
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,751
You get a sensation of pain

1040
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
Or they can dead nits down down down down down down down down

1041
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:50,015
Point is pain is a conversation between the brain and the body and Shawn thought

1042
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,831
What would happen if I actually let people

1043
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
See that

1044
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
Could they

1045
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:02,303
Take control of it yes we did a study in Melanie signed up so describe what happens in the six

1046
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
If you're putting this

1047
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
MRI machine

1048
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,191
We put somebody into a scanner and brain scanner

1049
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
And you have a screen in front of

1050
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,823
What you see on the screen is something that normally only the researcher

1051
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
You see your own brain

1052
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,759
In real-time yeah you're just seeing one p call the anterior cingulate cortex

1053
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
How many parts of the brain

1054
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
Respond to pain but that's the one that it's an area that has been shown to be involved with pain perception turning pain

1055
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
Hang up and down it's thought to give

1056
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Pain it's emotional

1057
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
Bayland it's negative

1058
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,703
And you actually see an image of this little piece of your brain right there in front of you on the screen to meet you at your looking at your brain

1059
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Oh no it's confusing to everybody

1060
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,335
So instead we give a visual metaphor EC an image of

1061
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:52,735
I'm fire plane in a nice case of a cartoon flying but it looks realistic

1062
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
Flickering flame do they leap into the activation

1063
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,719
I'm there is in that region

1064
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,047
Higher than planes go

1065
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:10,143
So Melanie is lying in the scanner watching her own pain flames

1066
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,471
And Sean gives her a set of instructions we say okay

1067
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:17,823
We want you to imagine that you're sitting in a nice warm soothing jacuzzi

1068
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,223
You know this printing is a warm bath is burning is very relaxing I'm relaxing into it

1069
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,527
I presume it was like

1070
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
Before she knew it the Flames were Riley

1071
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Okay okay

1072
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
How about your lying on a beautiful beach

1073
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:39,839
Yes

1074
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
You know this writing is

1075
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,751
Suntan and the sand is nice and warm and pleasant

1076
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,287
Angular

1077
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
Have been in my new bathing suit if I

1078
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
I'm getting front like this

1079
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Sunburn

1080
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,015
And then the flames

1081
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Kind of go

1082
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Crazy

1083
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,623
Our thoughts keep slipping out of her control

1084
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
Every time she would see those Flames rise

1085
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
To think Ono the Flames are rising which would make them rise

1086
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,095
That's even more and then more and more until she had this bonfire on this

1087
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:16,191
Screen your immediately struck by they look like the Flames where you're going to

1088
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,983
The Flames were you're burned at the stake

1089
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,775
I've been reading a lot of lies

1090
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Negative

1091
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
And flip it then I started

1092
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,783
Trying to move into the idea of being

1093
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
St. Peter Martyr

1094
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
That I

1095
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,391
Believe that I

1096
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
With hive

1097
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
Pokemon that I was

1098
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,743
Protected by my faith

1099
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
And it's Melanie started thinking about this

1100
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
She could see the flames

1101
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
Dying down

1102
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
Just little bit

1103
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,847
But you thought okay I'll try this might need

1104
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
Going in that

1105
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
Kind of feeling

1106
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
I was trying to pick one of the few pairs I

1107
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
I knew

1108
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
I mean I I didn't

1109
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
I'm half-jewish

1110
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
And how Christian

1111
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,231
I went through them not settled in until what kind of

1112
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,303
Margaret Atwood

1113
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,887
You know I start thinking

1114
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,727
And if you have to ask him about us

1115
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
Jewish wedding Kristen and I think about Jewish Martyrs like what prayers do they say she added and revived

1116
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
Nice details

1117
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
The Flames go down

1118
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,319
Okay I'm in the right brain State let me do more of that

1119
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,647
To Melanie finally decided okay I'm going to be this one

1120
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
Particular Jewish Martyrs names

1121
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Eva ben-joseph

1122
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,327
He's burned at the stake by the Romans for teaching the Torah

1123
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:53,727
And this particular Legend. Just as the execution is about to set fire to the logs right underneath his feet Akiva

1124
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,519
Stare the Executioner in the eyes

1125
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
And smile

1126
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
And the Executioner

1127
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,431
Why are you smiling you're about to be burned alive

1128
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
A kippah set

1129
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
All my life

1130
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
When I said those words

1131
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,831
You shall love the Lord

1132
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,391
Your God with all your heart with all your soul

1133
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
I was sad

1134
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Cuz I thought

1135
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,023
When should I be able to feel that command

1136
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
And now

1137
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,887
But I'm giving my life and my resolution remains firm

1138
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
Why shouldn't I smile

1139
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,799
And by the time Melanie had this fantasy buildup in her mind

1140
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
She looked over at the fair

1141
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
She noticed

1142
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
They were almost gone

1143
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
0

1144
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
0k

1145
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
For the first time

1146
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,575
She taking control of it I felt like

1147
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
Wow

1148
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,879
I am

1149
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,183
Watching my brain

1150
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
Thinking my thoughts

1151
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
And I am

1152
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,815
Changing my thoughts

1153
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,631
By thinking and watching myself

1154
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
So you are looking at yourself looking at yourself

1155
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Looking at yourself

1156
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Looking at yourself

1157
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:05,151
Yes it's like hearing inside and seeing the ghost in the machine

1158
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,455
Step on the moon like I am

1159
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
Watching my brain

1160
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,295
Thinking my thoughts

1161
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,599
And I am thinking my thoughts

1162
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,695
Changing my thoughts by thinking and watching my thoughts

1163
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
Watching my

1164
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
Brain changing my thoughts

1165
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,607
By thinking and watching myself do this

1166
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,495
Well I needed to stop at I need to stop at this.

1167
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
Once you were

1168
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
Did your two sessions on your in between exercise

1169
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,431
Without this all these gizmos could you

1170
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
Could you

1171
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,991

1172
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271

Like you think well okay

1175
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,415
Can't you just get the feedback from your own body

1176
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,463
But somehow this is satanism

1177
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
White

1178
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,535
Direct enough that I think

1179
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,583
That you could do it without the visual

1180
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
Feedback

1181
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
