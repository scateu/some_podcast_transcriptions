1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,448
Listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,568
Radiolab WNYC

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
Radiolab on Jetta

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,784
From Rod couple months ago the more perfect team and I

5
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
Released

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
A doc called the gun show

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
True sort of

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Turn off angle look at

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
At the history that

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
Underlies

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
How we talk

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Buy guns of the sky

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
It landed right after the mass shooting in Vegas

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Unfortunately here we are again

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
We noticed a lot of more perfect

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
We're sharing this doc

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
In the wake of what happened in

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Florida

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,432
So we thought we would share it with Radiolab listeners who haven't heard of

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,504
It's reported by a guy named Sean ROMs

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
At the time Shawn was a producer

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
More perfect

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
He sits going on to

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Start a daily podcast

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
The Box called today

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Explained

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Anchorage

28
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Need to check out that Shoshanna is amazing

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Anytime

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
Here's the gun show

31
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
I think we should start with one of the most

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
Confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
Not that one I got

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
A well regulated militia

35
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
,

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
Being necessary to the security

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Of a free state

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
,

39
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
The right of the people to

40
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Keep and bear arms

41
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
,

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Shall not being

43
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
Say one more time

44
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
From the top and do it do it with the comments

45
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
Sure a well regulated militia

46
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
, being necessary to the security

47
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Of a freezer

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
State

49
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,544
Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms

50
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
Totally unnecessary,

51
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Shall not be in

52
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
Is that the one that's about guns

53
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Adam Winkler who wrote the book

54
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
On the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight is a journal

55
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
He's a professor of law at UCLA

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
He said it's almost as a James Madison the author of the amendment I just discovered this wonderful new thing the, and why

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Wanted to put it in there as many times as

58
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
Which is like

59
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Nrt professorial joke

60
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
But like seriously what is it in like

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
It has to be this one couldn't have been the amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
And that they made like Jess

63
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Indecipherable

64
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
Never since

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Generations of Americans have been

66
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Confused by the language of the Second Amendment

67
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
So when the singers written we had just fought this war with the British

68
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
This Revolutionary War

69
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
And they try to win it right from the get-go

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Viking braggot

71
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,840
So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going like

72
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
We don't know if we want to trust you quite yet

73
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
So does the Second Amendment says

74
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
You guys can fight back

75
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Like the feds aren't going to disarm you you can your malicious to keep your

76
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Stats

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
I think what we agree on

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
But then after that you just look at the sentence

79
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,944
That is not just a commas that are confusing

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
If you look at the sentence as a whole

81
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Pieces don't seem to fit

82
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Get together there's some now I'm confused

83
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
I mean

84
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who

85
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Who get that right

86
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
At the beginning of the sentence

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
You got a well regulated

88
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Militia

89
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Demolition

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
States have a right to form militias

91
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
What's to assemble

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Groups of people and those people got to have their guns

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
That's easy enough

94
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
But then later in the sentence

95
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
There's, the right of the people to

96
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
To keep and bear arms

97
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
, shall not be infringed

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
The people

99
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Which people

100
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Those people over there in the militia

101
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
All people

102
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
If you mean all people

103
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Why'd you say militia

104
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
It's like

105
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
The first clause

106
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
The point of some sort of collective right to bear arms

107
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
And the second clause

108
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Seems to point to some individual right

109
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,168
Right to bear arms if it's supposed to be a popularly ratified document

110
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
It's actually not that easy to read

111
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,056
And it's not it wasn't that easy to read done

112
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
This is Jill Lepore staff writer at the New Yorker mag

113
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
She's also a professor of American history

114
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
I studied 18th century

115
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
I'm really trying to the 17th and 18th century American political story

116
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
And Jill says

117
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tended to just focus

118
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
On the first part that the primary motivation for the amendment is

119
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
About militia well-regulated

120
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Militia

121
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
That is confusing sentence was

122
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Widely read as the

123
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
This Collective

124
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
Militia right not an individual one truth that the Second Amendment fact guarantees the right of

125
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
An individual to bear arms and that the government federal government

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
In any fashion

127
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Juices that just didn't exist

128
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
I disagree with the way you characterize that

129
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,583
Although what you said is stated in the media frequently the Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several

130
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,911
Cases I've written several books on Second Amendment issues

131
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
He actually thinks

132
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
Hey the sentence is just fine as is as complicated at all

133
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:06,431
The framers were thinking about an individual right to there aren't the Second Amendment refers to the right of the

134
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
The people to

135
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Keep and bear arms

136
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
I mean who is that if it's individuals or not some kind of collected that doesn't exist in reality

138
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
So which

139
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Which was it

140
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
That that's a really good question to add I mean

141
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
If it's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that

142
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
No people I spoke to for the story said

143
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,519
At least in the 20th century when the when the second amendment was taught in law schools

144
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
It was taught this

145
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
It was taught as a sort of

146
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Antiquated

147
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Outdated

148
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
Thing that have to do with malicious not so much

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Individual rights

150
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
But

151
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,319
Tulip or Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both

152
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Agreeance

153
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
Is that this

154
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail

155
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Of our American politics today

156
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
That just was not

157
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
I think

158
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
It was not like that it was

159
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Utterly ignored

160
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
People ignored

161
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
This amendment When I Was An undergraduate

162
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
Undergrad at Florida State University

163
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,663
What did the Florida Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that

164
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
There was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment

165
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,343
Except for the third amendment the zoo there was no Amendment it was less written about less

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Legislated less

167
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Activated

168
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,487
That's a subjective Supreme Court conversation

169
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
And the second

170
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
Don't get me wrong this is not to say people didn't think about guns

171
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,447
People had guns States regulated guns but for most of our history the Second Amendment

172
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
It was like

173
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,615
Heavenly sword of the runt of the Bill of Rights literally like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to think about

174
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
There was no fight no fight how surprising that is

175
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
Is giving its centrality to our

176
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Political compass

177
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
What is

178
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Extraordinary transfer

179
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Because there was this

180
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Window of time where

181
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
All of this

182
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Changes that the scriptures

183
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Best flips

184
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
There's two hundred years

185
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
Of everything being chill

186
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
And then suddenly

187
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
You got

188
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
This

189
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
I want say those fighting words

190
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
From my cold

191
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,015
So basically in

192
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
The Flash the Second Amendment goes from being

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
Ignored to being

194
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
Supposed to be Radioactive

195
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
And in the process we start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hot

196
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,823
Lead debated thing that's got nothing to do with that first part and everything

197
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
To do

198
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,663
What the second part of her judges

199
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
Nothing you can do folks

200
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
And me

201
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is I don't know

202
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
And what I want to know is how did that happen

203
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now

204
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
And and what I found out is that

205
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
In the modern history of the gun rights movement and

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
And how we read the second amendment can you boil down to these

207
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
3

208
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Totally

209
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
Unrelated disjointed seeming

210
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Revolutionary event

211
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
Am I underweight and invasion in Sacramento

212
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,183
Damn let me know what in the hell to a Revolt in Cincinnati Prudential do you have

213
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
You tell me I'm wrong and finally

214
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Number three

215
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
A reckoning

216
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
At the Supreme Court of the United

217
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Unbelievable

218
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Who is that

219
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Cat sound

220
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Can you imagine that

221
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
So you can tell me the story 3

222
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Yeah

223
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
Supreme Court of the United States

224
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Supreme Court of the United States

225
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,607
United States

226
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Chapter one

227
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
The Invasion

228
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
I'm a carpenter I'm a builder I'm a stand-up comedian

229
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,303
Jazz drama structure repairman high performance aircraft

230
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,423
Ideal electromagnetic field backlight non-destructive testing to the Gemini missile program

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
And I believe

232
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Brake shop

233
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Guns

234
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
I was an expert shot with guns or novice

235
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
12 years old I was raised a hunter and a fisherman

236
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Besides being a carpenter and a building

237
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,527
When I'm 12 years old my father buys me a high-powered rifle

238
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Hollow tip ammo

239
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
I can knock a elephant down with that

240
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
S*** you said I'm getting at

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
Can I get you to tell me it's so we had to start at some point I have you tell me just

242
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Your name and who are we are and who who who you are

243
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
My name is Bobby seale I created the Black Panther Party on the founding chairman and National organizer the black

244
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
Standing right now

245
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Where Oakland California

246
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
The Black Panther

247
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,735
Yeah so this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms

248
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
You could argue that

249
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
That whole individual gun rights movement started

250
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
In the 1960

251
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Cities with the Black Panthers

252
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
In Oakland

253
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,559
It's an unlikely and got a surprise in origin for what's known as individual rights interpretation of the

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
Second Amendment

255
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
Street to get some contacts as 1966

256
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
It's been

257
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
An exceptionally bad time for race relations all over the country

258
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,991
11:15

259
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
Attack dogs and hoses

260
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
And in particular

261
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Black community and the police

262
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,031
The late 60s there were several high-profile incidents of Officer shooting unarmed black man

263
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
This is what was happening

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
You know and

265
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
What we did is that yet we took a position

266
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
October 1966

267
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
Barcelona Spain Huey P Newton they start this organization called the Black Panther

268
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Black Panther Party for self

269
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Defense

270
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
Fue Bobby's co-founder if he was 2 years in law school

271
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,655
You was going to the University of San Francisco School of Law

272
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
And

273
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,287
One day he sitting there as as you doing law school thinking about the law think about Malcolm X

274
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Thinking about what you can do in Oakland

275
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
And it hits

276
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,431
The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees

277
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,271
The citizen's right to bear arms on public property

278
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
But they can argue

279
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
That the Second Amendment gave them a right

280
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Have a gun

281
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
He said pass a constitutional Democratic civil human right

282
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
In those who

283
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Claim that the Second Amendment protect an individual right

284
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Right to bear arms people who argued that were in the minority

285
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
They want taken too seriously

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,591
Play this is one of the first times that the individual rights reading was forced

287
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Into the mainstream because

288
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
Did the

289
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
We have a right to bear arms we individuals then

290
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
We can control the police observe the police

291
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
Tell him that we control the police

292
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,815
What did he ghost you in law school so what legal status do we have

293
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,167
That second half of the Second Amendment right to bear arms

294
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:00,031
Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law

295
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed

296
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
If the gun is not concealed

297
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
It's not illegal

298
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
The Black Panthers started policing the police

299
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
We did

300
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
Go out in arms patrols and follow police car on 7th Street

301
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
Stockton California nightlife District police officer pulled over

302
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Sing from down the street

303
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
And the Crowds Are

304
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
The Gathering holding a gun shotgun

305
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Going to UC with his hair

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,735
What's a high standard going to cost 89 or $79 I bought the damn gun Isis here Huey

307
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
You got your shotgun now

308
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
White cop on one side of street arresting somebody

309
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
And the other side of the street you got a dozen black guys holding shock

310
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Strictly for observation

311
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,303
Was standing in a line I had everybody standing in line

312
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
He told me the moment the cop notice

313
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Timmy Lee stop what he was doing with the guy yet

314
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Pulled over

315
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,543
And walked over to them and said you have no right to observe me

316
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:10,943
The hummus is no California state Supreme Court ruling states that every citizen has the right to stand and observe a police officer

317
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
Carry out the duties as long as it's not a reasonable distance away

318
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
A reason for this

319
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Costumes 8 to 10 ft

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
What's an approximate 20 ft from you

321
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Observe you whether you like it or not

322
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
He said man what kind of negroes of these

323
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Let me see that gun no

324
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
You cannot touch my weapon

325
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
The cop says

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
Are you a Marxist and use it are you a fascist

327
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Are you a Martian

328
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Are you a fascist

329
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Then the cops I asked you first

330
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
And you saying I asked you second

331
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
OU

332
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
I mean

333
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
It's like a standoff

334
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
And this is where the dominoes start to fall

335
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
The Senate results until

336
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
Diesel about the cops in Oakland are not happy and they

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Family start

338
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
Running without the chain next thing we know

339
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Got to protect

340
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Society from nuts with gun

341
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,959
And I think we should act and we intend to act Mumford State Assembly representative

342
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Just trying to put a bill in the stuff Black Panthers

343
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
Guns and weapons in public places

344
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,527
What does Bill the Mulford Act is up for debate at the California state capitol in Sacramento

345
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,623
And Bobby seale decide the Panthers should be there for the debate and that they should

346
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
To take the gun

347
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,023
I took a delegation and armed delegation to the California state legislature May 2nd 1967

348
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
I have six women

349
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
N24 mail

350
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
How many guns

351
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
20

352
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
3 guns

353
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
And where they loaded

354
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Yes

355
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
So they roll up the assembly in Sacramento

356
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
And guess who happens to be waiting for them right there on the front lawn of the assembly

357
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
When we talking with what you were talking to guess who's governor

358
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
I don't know who it was

359

361
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,975
When we got there Ronald Reagan happened to be on the front lawn

362
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511

364
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
He was on the front lawn

365
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Future Leaders of America

00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,311
So you got Ronald Reagan 50-60 feet from us

00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Angela press

372
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Follow

373
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
What's going on what's going on

374
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
And Bobby seale to read a state

375
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
The Black Panther Party for self-defense called upon the American people in general and that's what I read the statement of the black people

376
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
In particular

377
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
Take careful note

378
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
Are there races California legislature

379
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
Which is now considering legislation

380
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,319
And I keeping the black people disarmed and Powerless at the very same time

381
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
Racist police agencies throughout the country

382
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Intensifying the terror

383
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,743
Brutality murder and repression of black people

384
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Etcetera

385
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
While he was reading that uniform Capital guards come running out

386
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,519
The opposite direction from us away from the kids

387
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Okay

388
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
That's what we decided to go inside

389
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,175
Because the assembly was in session at the time

390
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Next thing I know

391
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
We all loading

392
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
13 elevator

393
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
Used shotgun rifles pointing up

394
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Camera NX

395
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Crowded

396
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Body touching body crowded

397
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
When they got off the elevator he asked him

398
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Which way do The Spectator section

399
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
So the Panthers could

400
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,143
Watch the legislature debate the bill somebody says this way to the right

401
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
And so I walk into this door and as I walk into the door

402
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
The president pro temp in the State Assembly will the actual flow of the Sims this is not the guy

403
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
@dan spectator sex

404
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
I said come on get the hell out of him and win the wrong goddamn play sweetie walking to the state capitol with shotguns

405
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Am I under arrest

406
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
And then all hell breaks loose

407
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,095
Am I underweight

408
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
I turn around and I see

409
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
State Assembly NY State Assembly ducking down behind their deaths

410
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Government work

411
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Don't let a man exercises

412
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Is constitutional rights

413
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
I can point to this

414
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Forgotten

415
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Unknown moment

416
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
Here in the State Building in Sacramento

417
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
I've liked

418
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
The game changer

419
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
For the conversation

420
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
About guns

421
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
In America

422
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Because suddenly

423
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
Overnight we were on the front pages of newspapers around the world who are

424
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:58,175
Ragtag organization with this International notoriety

425
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Deuce to the world

426
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
You had a lot of people going

427
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
Wait what like there's a bunch of black man rolling around with guns

428
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Walking into the Capitol Building when there's

429
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,975
Kids around what came of that that provided

430
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
The law said no one

431
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
Could carry a loaded weapon

432
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Inside city limits

433
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
Within a hundred fifty feet of public property

434
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,055
This was directed at the Black Panthers when you know it was

435
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,639
The people have all kinds of opinions about the Black Panthers and what they did

436
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,735
Particularly after Huey Newton shooting happened at 5 a.m.

437
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,135
Later that same year was arrested for shooting and killing a cop approved blood marks the spot

438
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Parole officer John Frey

439
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
Was found fatally wound

440
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
The case was eventually dismissed

441
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
But

442
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,119
What seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision to use the Second Amendment

443
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Turn on themselves

444
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
To show up armed

445
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
At the state capitol in California inspired

446
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
A big respect life

447
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
FBI director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation

448
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
Chicken spot a Revolution was about to break out right here at home

449
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,927
This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws in California but also

450
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
Federal gun-control many of which seemed

451
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
To be targeted towards African-Americans rather than just reducing gun violence

452
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
We've got to get guns off the street

453
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
But the irony was

454
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Even though those laws were designed to

455
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Disarm

456
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,639
Left-leaning black radicals

457
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Many white rural conservatives

458
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
Thought that they were next

459
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
That government was going to take their guns next

460
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
Every action

461
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Create a react

462
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
At the same time

463
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
Panthers thing is

464
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,399
Hitting front pages of newspapers around the world

465
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,263
You got assassinations you got race riots you got Vietnam protests

466
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
All of a sudden everyone's clamoring for gun control

467
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Democrats

468
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
And Republican

469
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
In fact

470
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,711
There is absolutely no reason why out on the street

471
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Civilian

472
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
Should be carrying a loaded weapon

473
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
Reagan that was the exact

474
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Same day

475
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,720
At the Black Panthers showed up at state capitol in Sacramento

476
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
With a shotgun

477
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Listen to gun control has fingerprints all over

478
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
What's Happening Here

479
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Is the Black Panther show up in the capital

480
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Sacramento

481
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
And Ron Reagan react

482
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
They create some gun control

483
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
Then there's even more gun control even federal gun control

484
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
And a lot of people are sitting home watching this

485
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
And they start to get very

486
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Upset

487
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
Which brings is to chapter 2

488
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
The revolt

489
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
You know we can't allow this to happen

490
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
I can buy the damn pistol that I wanted

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,864
These two guys John aquilino live in Rockport Texas

492
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
Joseph turow Buffalo New York

493
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
They get us there

494
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
And they've both been in the guns pretty much their entire life

495
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
My father was

496
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Veteran

497
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
World War 1

498
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Did some Recreation

499
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Shooting with

500
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,248
My mother and I used to love to go to the amusement park

501
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
And spend all day shooting with 22

502
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,648
Little things that moved in the shooting gallery but neither one of them

503
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
Piccalilli hardcore about their gum police until around the time

504
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
The Black Panthers

505
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,632
Give me the fact that here bunch of people who were

506
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
Slightly darker

507
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
Complected then New England

508
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
Ivy league grads running around with firearms

509
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
Did did that scare people

510
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Hell yeah

511
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
Did it scare you know I didn't scare me I didn't

512
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,808
John told me Joe is well that it wasn't the Panthers themselves that was a problem

513
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,672
I don't like anybody to tells me I can't do something it's all the gun control laws

514
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Came

515
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
In the wake

516
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
When the gun control Act

517
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
First pass

518
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,376
Today we begin to disarm the criminal

519
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Careless

520
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
And then say

521
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
A lot of things just appeared that I had been used to

522
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Joe says he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood close

523
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotguns

524
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
$5 think they stop selling them

525
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
And he says that is really bothered him because

526
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,856
The reason you have a gun is for protection

527
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
It's like another form of insurance

528
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,512
Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the sixties and seventies

529
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Not the safest place in the world

530
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
His house

531
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Was even broken into

532
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
I could only

533
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Describe

534
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Wangjing beijing

535
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
These guys actually

536
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Better

537
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Their way

538
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
2 Doors

539
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,384
Joseph seen his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun

540
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
Wally's two guys storm through his house

541
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
And

542
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Rotten

543
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
I didn't take care of my wife

544
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Purse

545
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Some other money

546
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
And they are

547
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
I mean by the time the police got there

548
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Devon

549
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
Joe's whole relationship with Firearms is there a predicated upon that

550
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
This idea that it's for self-defense and

551
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Hear he's got

552
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
People breaking into his house

553
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
He's got

554
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:13,568
The cops not being there for him he's got the government trying to take his gun away so what do you do

555
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
You join

556
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
The end

557
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
Ra

558
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Fight this gun control

559
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
But

560
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,320
This came at a moment where the NRA was at this

561
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
Crossroads unlike

562
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Any edit seen before

563
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Orson

564
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
Guangzhou join in the early 70s the NRA

565
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Was not the die-hard supporter of gun rights

566
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
Let me know today

567
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
Because according to Adam Winkler

568
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,312
It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA

569
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Continue

570
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Three fundamental right down to

571
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:53,248
Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training so that the next time there's a war Americans would be

572
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Capable of fighting

573
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders

574
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times

575
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective in the Civil War because they were not familiar with

576
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Firearms

577
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
Really yeah like a hundred years their main focus was like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not

578
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
The sacrament

579
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,432
And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifle

580
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
In the forties

581
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
50s

582
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
The animated version of Playboy guns instead of girl

583
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
You'll be amazed

584
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392
That you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment

585
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Anywhere in those magazine

586
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
The NRA at that point was

587
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
Sort of like a gun trade group they were

588
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Not super political and

589
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
And the people who ran it they were Hunters

590
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
John Hunter

591
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,008
They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt

592
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
According to John Rich guys who

593
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
You don't give her Hobbies

594
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
But you had all these people coming in

595
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,504
Like Joe and like John who were convinced that guns weren't about

596
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Shooting.

597
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
They were about self defense

598
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Protecting yourself against criminals

599
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,720
In a time of starkly Rising crime rates this would lead to this straight up

600
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Head on collision

601
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
At the NRA

602
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Now

603
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
Joe and John join the NRA

604
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,960
The organization had just for the first time

605
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Sort of set-up this lobbying

606
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,592
Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action

607
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
John actually got hired to work there in 1976

608
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
And district for legislative action

609
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Supposed to fight for gun rights

610
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
Capitol Hill that's what they both wanted it

611
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Did it but

612
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
Let's put it this way

613
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
We were the

614
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,768
If you would the bastard stepchildren of the National Rifle Association

615
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Really yeah

616
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
When the institute for legislative action

617
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
Was formed in 1975

618
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
The NRA

619
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
Refuse The Institute any Office Space

620
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
In the building

621
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,896
In the mid-seventies the part of the NRA that Lobby politicians

622
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
Had to rent office space from the hotel neck

623
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
Door to the NRA is crazy

624
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
And then

625
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Right after he was hired 78 people

626
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Fire

627
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,232
Very interesting leaves big firing

628
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
And then there was word

629
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Did the NRA wanted to move

630
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Weave washing

631
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
Selva headquarters there and moved Colorado Springs

632
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
What's in Colorado Springs

633
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Olympic camp

634
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,592
They were going to move to headquarters and put it in there this

635
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
The Olympics

636
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
Sports training group so that they could then start writing all the magazines about all the Olympic sports

637
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
They really didn't know

638
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:40,928
Deliver do they wanted to turn the NRA from organization of firearms owners

639
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
2

640
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
A Publishing Company

641
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
They wanted to get out

642
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
The policy

643
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,912
The older Garden seem to have the stomach for whatever

644
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,240
Gunfight some members wanted to hat they were very moderate

645
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
They thought like maybe we should try and kind of get out of this hole gun business thing

646
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Getting out

647
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,808
John says there's even a moment when a report surface that suggested we should change the name of the

648
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Association

649
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Really yeah they were going to take rifle out

650
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
Tell me more tell me everything I say

651
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Do you remember what any of those proposed names or no

652
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,632
But they were considering at least taking rifle out

653
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh yeah

654
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Huh

655
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,520
And it is bridled I mean I was

656
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
So pissed off

657
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
And that's

658
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
When

659
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
The seeds of Revolt were planted

660
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
A few months later

661
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112

706
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
Blah blah blah blah blah

707
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
And then

708
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Little business

709
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
There are four

710
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Microphone

711
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,808
The members part of the meeting where members submit proposals which happens in like this

712
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Super parliamentary sorta way

713
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
This guy Neil Knox

714
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
He was part of their group

715
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Any kind of bullrush the microphone

716
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
And he said

717
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
The Gather members have a list of bylaws

718
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Did they would like to have voted on

719
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Translation

720
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Bugattis 15 demand

721
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,008
Restricting demands

722
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
Not sure if it's more or less than Martin Luther number one we demand that the NRA

723
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,296
Not move to pick or cancel that the institute for legislative action which you want to kill

724
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
Should have more power through hell yes

725
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Hell yeah

726
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
And we demand that the current NRA leadership

727
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Beer place we wanted to take over

728
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,376
So the Federation guys making all these demands was crazy

729
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Was that the

730
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
The leadership of the NRA

731
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
That was one of the meetings they just sat there

732
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
They they were like

733
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
Dumbfounded

734
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,992
But every time the Federation guy would make a motion judge Porter would say

735
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Do I have a second

736
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Would start to speak for and against

737
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Intermittent

738
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,560
The Federation members will use their walkie-talkies to coordinate who spoke at what microphone

739
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
How many votes did you need that day

740
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
I think this leash

741
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
600 volts

742
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,056
And how many votes did you think you had if you needed 600 so how many did you think it we had the slightest I do

743
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Going in

744
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
We

745
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Faded

746
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
50/50 support

747
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
So as each of the 15 amendments are being debated the insurrectionists are running around in their orange caps with their walkie-talkies trying

748
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
That discussion debate

749
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
Less than 8 hours

750
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
It went from 7 p.m.

751
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Post for 5 in the morning

752
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
4 a.m.

753
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
And nobody love

754
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,912
They were all there

755
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
I mean we really didn't know whether to pull this off

756
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,544
But Joe says one of the big turning points

757
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,360
Is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic

758
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
He was at the time the head

759
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
Of the institute for legislative action

760
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
To get into the mic and

761
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
He played it take

762
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Remember

763
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,464
This was one that Bob Kukla secretly recorded I don't know how he did it but what you hear on this tape is babka

764
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,072
Cuckoo talking to his bosses at the NRA and they're yelling at him berating him

765
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Or going to orbit

766
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
Time somebody talks

767
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
They're basically like

768
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Bob

769
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Shut up

770
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,336
He had to take there and he played it over the

771
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
And

772
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
Of course that electrified the audience

773
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
You could actually hear

774
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
People gas

775
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
The rank-and-file was

776
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Audibly

777
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
This was this was evident

778
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,928
That the other side was going to deep six

779
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
The gun

780
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Metro fights

781
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
People on the tape they're all in the room

782
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
Oh yeah there's still sitting next to him

783
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
The table

784
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,960
Over the course of this one 9-hour meeting

785
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
On a hot

786
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
Stinky night in Cincinnati every single one of those 50 proposals

787
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Was pass

788
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
We stopped the building in Colorado

789
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Ensure the answer I wouldn't change its name

790
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,808
Justify the leadership know just like the political savant

791
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
Let's figure that Hillary is going to get the presidency

792
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
They just

793
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Absolutely took it in their shorts

794
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,536
And maybe the biggest change the most important change

795
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Was that

796
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
The Institute for legislative action this

797
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
Political lobbying arm of the NRA

798
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
It was given the keys

799
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
To the car

800
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
They were not

801
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
The bastard

802
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Stepchild anymore they

803
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
War

804
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
The NRA

805
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
You know what

806
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
We won they had essentially

807
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Staged

808
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
What are they called 1776

809
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
It's the same thing when the sun rose the very next day

810
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
The NRA have a whole new board

811
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
Committed to a new

812
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
No compromises view of the cell

813
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Second Amendment

814
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:47,936
Individuals have a right not only to have a gun but to have almost any gun that they want and have as many of them

815
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
As they want

816
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
I can take those guns almost any place they want

817
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
American Gun politics

818
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Literally change

819
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Overnight

820
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
I just shortly after this coup

821
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
The NRA

822
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Both

823
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
This Abridged version of the Second Amendment

824
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
Right on the wall front center and its headquarter

825
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,904
The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
Nice clean

827
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Totally uncomplicated sentence

828
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,840
Conveniently left out was the part that talked about a well regulated militia

829
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Be necessary for the

830
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Security of a free state

831
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
I asked John like

832
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
What about the militia part of the

833
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:28,640
Why doesn't the NRA ever talk about that now you get me back to asking you if

834
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
John I love you dearly

835
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Trust me

836
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
But

837
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
It's only been in less what 30 years

838
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
That if you'll pardon the expression

839
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,976
The b******* media has turned the militia into a four-letter word

840
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
The militia is you and me Sean

841
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
Post-coup

842
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,264
The NRA took a very hard line on gun control

843
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
And became an irrepressible political force in America

844
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Scare congressman

845
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,808
Lies in its ability to mobilize its members in any congressional district

846
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
At the touch of a computer button

847
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,696
They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying and just

848
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
A few years after that Cincinnati revolt

849
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
The NRA endorses its first

850
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Presidential candidate

851
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,144
The Constitution does not say

852
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
The government shall decree

853
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
The right to keep and bear arms

854
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:32,640
Reagan Reagan the Constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be

855
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Be in French

856
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,064
At this point everyone and their Uncle leaves out the militia part of the Second Amendment

857
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
Which is why Americans eventually start to forget

858
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
That

859
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,208
The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist

860
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
I wish I could save that instead of the last

861
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
Winter things that most surprised me when I was doing some research

862
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
This is Jill Lepore

863
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,984
By the 1990s the new interpretation of the Second Amendment

864
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Had so penetrated

865
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Popular opinion

866
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,896
That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the first

867
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
By 1991

868
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
The First Amendment

869
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
That Eclipse really

870
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Kind of shocks

871
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,952
Even if even if the Panthers and the president American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia

872
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Clause of the 2nd Amendment

873
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
It didn't mean a lot without the

874
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
The courts

875
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
And the courts

876
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Particular

877
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Supreme Court

878
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Woodbine

879
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,728
Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court from 19

880
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
69 to 1986 Warren Burger

881
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,104
I think you saw me giving a television interview and he says

882
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
But this new interpretation of the

883
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Second amendment was

884
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
The greatest pieces of

885
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,344
One of the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud on the American public

886
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
Do I have ever seen in my lifetime

887
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,512
And this was a republican appointed by Richard Nixon now

888
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Yeah

889
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,168
Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not dying to have this conversation at the moment

890
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,496
But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire

891
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Federal court system in America

892
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
There is not one

893
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
In our history at this point

894
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Over 200 years

895
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
Been a single instance

896
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,760
Of some gun law some State local gun law

897
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
Getting up to a court and the court going you know what you can't do this

898
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
It violates the second amendment that does not even happen

899
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
It's really not even there wasn't I like an amendment Smackdown anywhere in federal court

900
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
This isn't this isn't a thing

901
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
Why I'm getting Supreme Court to weigh in on it

902
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,960
That doesn't even look like it could be a thing it doesn't even look like much more than a fantasy

903
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
Until

904
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
For gun owners there are few names.

905
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Has become synonymous

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,864
Teachers looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

932
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Brilliant

933
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
Basically I want to hear about this

934
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
When a kid you know did something

935
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,800
It just means you lean back and say

936
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
How do they do that

937
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Maybe it was the moment that I

938
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,224
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

939
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
Or maybe the kid was a piano

940
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,880
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

941
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
Or maybe the kids in math class

942
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,744
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

943
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
We're interested in the

944
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
Epic moments where

945
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
A kid does something super smart

946
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
It doesn't have anything to do with

947
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
If you have a story

948
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
Go to radiolab.org

949
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Flash brilliance

950
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Mrecorder short

951
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Audio message

952
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
And that's radiolab.org

953
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Flash Brewing

954
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Thank you so much

955
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,544
Dolor in 2008 revives the Second Amendment or you could even say

956
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,944
Breathes life into the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment

957
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,064
Had never been taken truly seriously by federal courts

958
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Until 2008

959
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,744
That Cindy levenson professor at the University of Texas law school

960
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
Jad abumrad here with

961
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
Price of Sean

962
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Chad

963
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,656
It's I guess now it's time for chapped

964
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
3D color I never going to get to dick

965
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
But first

966
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Here's what's going on in America

967
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
2nd Amendment have become

968
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
One of those issues that can get you elected

969
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,735
Academics have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning

970
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
But the Supreme Court

971
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Is still staying out of it

972
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
They're leaving this up to the states

973
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal with

974
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
But then December 12

975
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Mm

976
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
Republican George W Bush become president elect

977
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,631
After divided US Supreme Court effectively

978
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:18,495
Recounts in Florida contested presidential vote tally George W bush is elected

979
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,823
The NRA likes George W bush

980
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
And he likes history

981
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
I'm protecting the second

982
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
To the United States cost

983
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,111
And in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected and individual rights

984
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
To own guns

985
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
UCLA law professor Adam Winkler again

986
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Right that was not limited

987
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Is most courts have held

988
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
To service in the militia

989
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,911
And almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft

990
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Put out a letter

991
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
This public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice

992
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,103
Adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment

993
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,455
And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out

994
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Corp

995
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
In

996
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Texas

997
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,367
Ruled that the Second Amendment did protect an individual right to bear arms

998
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
And that was a first

999
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,719
The big deal before this all the decisions and kind of

1000
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Beard in the other direction

1001
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
And because of that Court ruling

1002
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
And John Ashcroft letter

1003
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
List three libertarian lawyers

1004
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,311
Alan gura constitutional attorney Bob's easy a chair the board at the Cato Institute and

1005
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Clark neily

1006
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,199
Thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation

1007
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,527
I want thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't necessarily doing it

1008
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:39,903
For the guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement for them it was

1009
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,279
More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty

1010
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,911
It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it as income in the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted

1011
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,447
To exercise that right

1012
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,543
So that was their ankles adedeji I've always wondered why the gun rights movement has become such

1013
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
The proxy war for like anti-government

1014
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Mint

1015
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,455
Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about this something professor

1016
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
Sandy Levinson told me

1017
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Is that

1018
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,575
Sort of embedded in this amendment

1019
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Is

1020
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,671
The very idea that you can take up arms

1021
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
Against the government

1022
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
To protect yourself

1023
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,815
And your fellow man from tyranny on the far right

1024
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,631
Or occasionally on the far left

1025
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
You find people who are willing

1026
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
2

1027
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,799
Say this that this is really what's terrific about the Second Amendment

1028
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,895
But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals

1029
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
Arnott

1030
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,759
Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them

1031
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
And so mainstream conservatives

1032
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
Want to talk about self defense against

1033
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Burglars

1034
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,999
And mainstream liberals

1035
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
Want to talk about

1036
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,911
The second amendment protects State organized militia

1037
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
And

1038
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Almost nothing else

1039
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
Anyway getting back to the story

1040
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,591
These three libertarian lawyers they decide

1041
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,175
Together case and their idea was to Target this really was

1042
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Strictest gun law

1043
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Indeed

1044
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:14,367
All handguns were banned you could own a shotgun or rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber

1045
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
Even in self-defense or there was

1046
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
There's really funky we described it as a

1047
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
Ban on all functional firearm

1048
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,095
But in order to challenge that law they needed to find a plaintiff

1049
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
Interesting how do you find a

1050
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
Plaintiff

1051
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
You look for somebody who

1052
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
Got robbed what do you do

1053
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
Well we can actually instigate

1054
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
Litigation and we can take out a

1055
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
Full page ad in the New York Times saying

1056
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:40,479
I want to vindicate your second amendment rights give us a ring just sent we got the word out talk to

1057
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
I would say between 2 and 3 dozen

1058
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
People they all had really interesting stories they found a guy who was gay gentleman named Tom Palmer

1059
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
Previously been assaulted when he lived in California because he was gay was almost murdered by a skin

1060
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
Pinhead mahbuba phobic

1061
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Subs and he wanted

1062
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:05,823
To protect himself that are lead plaintiff was an African-American woman named Shelly Parker she was trying to protect herself again

1063
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,919
Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun

1064
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
Which was illegal

1065
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:16,831
Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women mid twenties to do

1066
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,951
Early 60s formal way to am African-American and the problem they ran into

1067
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,023
Was that all of these super sympathetic plaintiff

1068
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
Didn't have the

1069
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
Very special thing they needed

1070
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
To bring a case

1071
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Standing

1072
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
Standing which is just a legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case you have to show that

1073
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,591
Actually harmed the by

1074
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical

1075
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
Concrete proof

1076
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
The harm has been done that you've been

1077
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Denied a gun

1078
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
And none of the plaintiff had that

1079
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Except for one.

1080
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
Dick

1081
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
That's me

1082
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Good to meet you and you

1083
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
DeKalb

1084
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
What is your hat say

1085
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
Sean this is my favorite hat

1086
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
Make America

1087
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,567
Free again actually gets paid by the freedom

1088
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
With a big

1089
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,407
Western handgun in the center

1090
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
It looks like you drew a trigger out there that what you did

1091
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
Oh well it was missing the trigger so

1092
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
We had to update it

1093
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Who's we

1094
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
Okay

1095
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
Where's the Supreme Court

1096
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
The building where he became famous

1097
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
She's a

1098
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,815
Swim seventy five year old white guy

1099
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
Sports classes that look straight out of the 70s

1100
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
Got a situation here you want to cross

1101
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
Sure what's the situation

1102
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,711
See the day after Trump won the election they hate Freedom apparently

1103
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
President-elect is visiting the White House

1104
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,343
There were protesters everywhere

1105
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,695
Notmypresident there anti Trump protesters

1106
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,999
Don't you like freedom

1107
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:05,119
What about freedom

1108
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,191
Ford truck what about freedom

1109
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,031
Most of the protesters that were passing us wear white but

1110
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,383
Just as a few young black men pacify

1111
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
He says

1112
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,735
See you on the plantation

1113
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
Freedom

1114
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
Make America Trump again

1115
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,415
See you on the plantation

1116
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Yeah

1117
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
I just say that

1118
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,815
We in Washington we call it the government Plantation

1119
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
You didn't mean

1120
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,703
You kids are about to be slaves or something cuz that's how I interpreted it

1121
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,079
The more power government has the less Freedom you have the closer you get the ball and chain

1122
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Other Plantation

1123
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
This pretty good place to eat right there

1124
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,527
If you here for a couple of days if you've been in there I have not

1125
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Yeah pretty good

1126
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,159
Okay Hyatt Regency this is good for you we can do this

1127
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,511
We need to talk about Hyatt which is just down the street from Supreme Court and

1128
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,583
And explain to me that his journey with guns like

1129
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
John and Joe

1130
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
Began pretty casually

1131
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
Flight 1976

1132
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Is living in DC

1133
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,543
And one day you sitting at home

1134
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
I was watching

1135
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,383
My hero Matt Dillon

1136
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
Gunsmoke

1137
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
Different Matt Dillon

1138
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,599
And he had this long-barreled handgun

1139
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
I was about 30 years old

1140
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
And I figured collie

1141
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
I should own my first gun

1142
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
So when I went and bought

1143
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,607
My when I call my Matt Dillon special

1144
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline

1145
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
And it was just

1146
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
I live in America

1147
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
We're Cowboy Society

1148
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,103
I should have a cowboy gun and weave

1149
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
Nothing no really deep thought to it but then just a few months after he got that gun in October

1150
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,367
1976 a trend that started with the Mulford Act

1151
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,671
And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento

1152
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:09,279
Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed

1153
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,863
Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed

1154
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,167
All hang up so I had some choices

1155
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,751
I could turn it into the government not going to happen

1156
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,055
I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster

1157
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
Not going to happen

1158
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Or

1159
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
There was no other option I could go to jail

1160
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
Not going to happen

1161
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Eventually he decides on option D

1162
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,343
Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland

1163
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
So that made it very convenient

1164
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,487
Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what you do I would go visit

1165
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
And caress and use my gun

1166
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
What do you use it for

1167
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Target practice

1168
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Take me to

1169
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,727
Gun visitation situation sound functional but

1170
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,567
I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because

1171
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
More and more he didn't feel safe where he lifts I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street

1172
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
From

1173
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,343
The number one most infamous drug dealer Den

1174
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,415
In the city called Kentucky courts

1175
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,463
Every night at 2 a.m.

1176
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,303
The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm

1177
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
Into the air empty the clip

1178
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
And that was the signal every night at 2 but

1179
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
Drug dealing was over

1180
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
For the day

1181
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:27,615
It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really

1182
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,175
Shaped a lot of dicks views on gun

1183
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
So

1184
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
In the years after the handgun ban

1185
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,719
Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually then quits his desk job

1186
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
To pursue getting his gum back full-time

1187
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
I'm all over Capitol Hill and I see

1188
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
Security guards

1189
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Have done

1190
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
Well

1191
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
Dali

1192
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Why can't I be a security guard

1193
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Golly

1194
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
Maybe that would help me

1195
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
Have a gun

1196
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199
But I can't have on my own

1197
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,039
Let's see how easy or not easy this is

1198
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Dali

1199
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,879
One Step leads to another

1200
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Just like that

1201
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
Dick was able to have a gun in DC

1202
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
But only during the day and only while he was working

1203
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,559
Like Barney Fife

1204
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,399
At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets

1205
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
And they kept it there

1206
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
And they kept it on side of nose

1207
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
He finally starts looking for some help

1208
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,639
Some legal help but I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I've gone to something tanks

1209
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Cato in Heritage and some others

1210
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,015
I knew they existed and right around the time out there looking for some help

1211
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,087
Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick

1212
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
No no

1213
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,975
She wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy

1214
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,071
I was told repeatedly and it was in print that I was the worst

1215
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,679
Choice less-than-optimal

1216
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,983
He was always talk smack about

1217
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
The federal government an interview

1218
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
One day Clark Neely

1219
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Put a note in my hand

1220
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871
NSAID dick Heller

1221
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
This is what you say

1222
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
I just wanted a Gun 2

1223
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
Protect my house

1224
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
Shut up

1225
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
Play it wasn't their favorite princess

1226
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
But the one thing that no one else has done

1227
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,303
Which is besides just wanting an illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an application

1228
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
To register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia

1229
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:32,287
And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever it's called be like literally had this physical proof

1230
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Of his grieving

1231
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,919
And simple technical arbitrary little

1232
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
Stupid piece of paper gave him

1233
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:45,855
What's known as standing to bring the case stick however ended up being kind of Last Man Standing that was nothing to do with that was not

1234
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Regardless

1235
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,487
Again that we came there guy and these three lawyers they take the case of the DC Court

1236
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
And the judge

1237
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
After

1238
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,119
Inspecting it said the case can go forward

1239
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
Magic Moment

1240
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
This Magic Moment

1241
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,879
The Supreme Court is entering the debate over the Second Amendment right to bear arms

1242
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
Today's cases around

1243
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,767
Huge interest among citizens and politicians alike at it is divided even the president

1244
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
And vice president

1245
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Chapter 3

1246
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
The Reckoning March 18th

1247
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,959
2008

1248
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,519
The day the Heller case was argued

1249
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,591
In court everyone understood how high the stakes

1250
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,871
Square

1251
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:46,527
Outside in front of the Supreme Court protesters by the hundreds were marching and

1252
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,343
Panting

1253
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,671
Favor of gun rights and in favor of gun control

1254
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,071
Journalists from all over the world to send it upon the supreme court that day

1255
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,935
An inside the supreme court house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse

1256
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,751
You could have heard him out I say

1257
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
And

1258
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Everybody is just

1259
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Quiet

1260
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
And you can hear your heart beating

1261
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
And suddenly

1262
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,807
And then Oye Oye Oye

1263
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,623
The clerk yelled at the top of his lungs

1264
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
And then there's a strange sound

1265
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
What can that be

1266
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:32,863
It was the swishing of the Robes of the justices as they ascended the steps

1267
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
To the bench

1268
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
Unbelievable

1269
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,871
We will hear argument today in k07 290 District of Columbia vs. Heller

1270
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,967
Time in our history the Supreme Court would directly try to figure out what the Second Amendment mean

1271
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,503
District calendar

1272
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Immediately

1273
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:56,159
Good morning

1274
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,231
And jumps right into it

1275
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,535
Essential question like

1276
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,399
What was James Madison thinking when he wrote the super confusing sentence like 200 years ago was he

1277
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,775
Thinking about the individual people and the right to own a gun or was he thinking about the collective right

1278
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,079
Of the militia

1279
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,383
In the first text to consider

1280
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,199
Is the phrase protecting a right to

1281
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Keep and bear arms

1282
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,575
If you look at the phrase the phrase keep and bear arms

1283
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,415
How was used at the time to use the phrase bear arms

1284
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,975
Used to refer to the use of arms

1285
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,767
In connection with

1286
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:40,191
Madison's rough drafts of the Second Amendment it's pretty clear that when he says people

1287
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
I have a right to bear arms

1288
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
All he really means is

1289
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,335
Report for Duty

1290
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,455
TV and bearing arms when was first called confirmed

1291
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,759
That's a right

1292
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
It's a mystery

1293
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Right of the people

1294
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Nicky Barnes

1295
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:08,095
Is it just the people in the state militias why wouldn't they say state militias have the right to keep arms

1296
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
Listen to Justice I believe that the phrase

1297
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
The people

1298
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
And the phrase the militia

1299
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,031
We're really in sync with each other

1300
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
The Federalist farmer uses

1301
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,127
The phrase the people are the militia

1302
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,783
Cut against you if the militia included all the people that includes all the people

1303
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
Yes I do believe in inclusion

1304
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,719
At this point everyone jumps in a bunch of just start interrupting each other

1305
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:41,119
Scrum and they're all trying to figure out okay so when Madison was afraid

1306
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Not being friends like

1307
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,471
Who were the people he was talking about

1308
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
What those words meant was the people just the militia or everyone all people what is the

1309
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,431
Relationship between the second part of the sentence

1310
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,479
The people part and the first part of the sentence

1311
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:03,135
The militia part Verdugo rokita

1312
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,535
Scottish Highlanders for some reason

1313
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,607
They even start to diagram Madison sentence

1314
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,399
I think I see Discord

1315
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,959
Internet results

1316
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
According to Adam Winkler

1317
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
Was

1318
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,847
For liberals Stephen souter Breyer Ginsburg

1319
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,919
Seem to want to emphasize the militia part of the sentence

1320
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
Avenue had the for conservative just

1321
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
Galia Thomas

1322
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,087
Alito Roberts listen to One emphasize the people part of the sentence

1323
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,647
The second part I don't see how there's any any

1324
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Any

1325
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:40,767
Contradiction team captain quarterback

1326
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,815
The first chair that day was

1327
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Without a doubt

1328
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
Justice Antonin

1329
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
Scalia why isn't

1330
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Perfectly

1331
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Closet

1332
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
Indeed

1333
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,775
To assume that since the

1334
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,359
The framers knew that the

1335
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,431
Tracy Morgan

1336
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
But by taking away the people

1337
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Justice Scalia

1338
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,039
Of course was

1339
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,855
Very conservative Justice in Queens

1340
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
This is Joan biskupic

1341
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:13,535
Longtime reporter covering the Supreme Court has also written the biography of Justice Scalia

1342
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
He grew up in a time when

1343
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,911
Young men were trained in firearms in high school

1344
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,471
German Shepherd has played a vital role in.

1345
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,007
Even from the time he was

1346
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Kid at school in Queens

1347
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
He said he used to carry his gun

1348
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,383
For rifle practice at school

1349
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
On the Subways of New York

1350
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
Can you imagine doing that today in New York City

1351
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
You're being unrealistic

1352
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
The principal purpose here is the militia

1353
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
The second clause

1354
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Ghost

1355
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,303
Just the right of the people

1356
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,351
To keep and bear arms

1357
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:56,799
What year throughout the arguments is that Scalia is very very forward Lee pressing

1358
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,103
This word of individual rights argument

1359
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,687
Speaks of the right of the people like David souter

1360
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
Are arguing back sing

1361
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,271
What are the collected the militia

1362
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,183
This goes on for well over an hour the justices who are grilling the lawyers arguing amongst themselves ever

1363
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Everybody trying to figure out

1364
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,999
What was in James Madison's head

1365
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
Until finally

1366
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,447
Justice Breyer one of the liberal just what he says like you're saying hold the phone

1367
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,751
Myquest forget one that is intended

1368
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
There is no way for us to know

1369
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
Let's talk about now

1370
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,615
Talk about gun violence

1371
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,943
Descendants was most definitely written about muskets

1372
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,503
What about handguns and assault rifles

1373
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,551
What is reasonable

1374
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Now

1375
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
80 to a hundred thousand

1376
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
Some people every year

1377
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
In the United States

1378
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Rider killed

1379
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
In

1380
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Gun-related

1381
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Homicide

1382
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Crime

1383
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
Accident

1384
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Or suicide

1385
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Suicide

1386
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
That's why I say 81

1387
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Now in light of that

1388
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
Why

1389
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,895
Isn't a ban on hand

1390
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
A reasonable

1391
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,991
Or a proportion

1392
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Response

1393
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
On behalf

1394
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Alpha District

1395
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:19,487
Because you are for the same reason I was offered by numerous Military Officers

1396
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
At the highest levels

1397
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,815
Of the US military all branches

1398
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Service

1399
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
Writing to briefs

1400
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,935
They they agree with us at the handgun ban

1401
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,495
Search the week in America's military preparedness

1402
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,287
Algra basically argues

1403
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,079
When you take away people's guns

1404
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,615
They're going to be less prepared

1405
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,711
If and when they enlist in the Army to which Justice Breyer's like

1406
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,783
They can still practice shooting rifles

1407
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,319
Woodwork band in DC

1408
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,623
They can go to gun ranges I guess the neighbor

1409
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
States

1410
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,231
What does that make it unreasonable

1411
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Forest City

1412
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
With a very high primer

1413
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:01,215
Assuming that the objective is what the military people say to keep us ready for the draft

1414
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
If necessary

1415
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
Is it unreasonable

1416
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Forest City without high crime rate

1417
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
Just say no

1418
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Handguns

1419
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
Well

1420
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,319
You want to say yes that is correct but I want to hear what

1421
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,671
It is a big crime problem I'm simply getting you to focus

1422
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,231
Stop by the way it was Justice Scalia

1423
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
Telling Alan gura

1424
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071
How to answer Justice Breyer's Quest

1425
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
The answer is yes

1426
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:34,239
And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section

1427
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
Construction

1428
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
The oral arguments last 97 minutes

1429
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,247
Far longer than most other cases and going into the arguments

1430
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
Many Supreme Court Watchers

1431
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,087
Figured the case would be a close

1432
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
5-4 decision

1433
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,159
And it could go either way

1434
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
And as with

1435
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
All of these clothes cases

1436
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,559
Question was what would Anthony Kennedy the swing Justice

1437
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Do

1438
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
As in so many issues in America

1439
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe

1440
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:11,871
So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case

1441
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,431
Everyone was looking to hear

1442
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,223
What would he say about the Sacramento

1443
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,271
His was really devout the counted

1444
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,575
And the very first comment he made

1445
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,975
Set learn to defend

1446
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,047
Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes

1447
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
Outlaws

1448
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,375
Wolves bears and grizzly something like that

1449
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
One of the first things he said was about bear

1450
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Bear arms but

1451
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Grizzly bear

1452
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,871
The point Kennedy was trying to make with clear

1453
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,991
Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns

1454
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Other than just being in a militia

1455
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,855
What about people being in their homes

1456
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
And is meeting to defend themselves

1457
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
And that's when I silently screamed at the

1458
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,327
The top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes we win

1459
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
...

1460
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Something

1461
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:26,111
Just for your turn now to the historic Supreme Court decision handed down this morning

1462
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,951
07 to 90 District of Columbia vs. Heller

1463
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:37,375
We hold at the second amendment guarantees an individual right to have an alarm for self-defense in the hole

1464
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:42,239
And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home

1465
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,775
Be rendered inoperative

1466
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
Violate

1467
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:49,407
It was a groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment

1468
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,015
Scalia minimize

1469
01:04:54,271 --> 01:05:00,415
Dacquoise referring to a well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right of

1470
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,231
Do the people the people

1471
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
This was as good as it got for him

1472
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
On the bench

1473
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
I think so

1474
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,703
Rip the militia Clause December 15th 1791

1475
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
The June 26

1476
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
2008

1477
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,311
A pretty good run if I'm being honest

1478
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,663
For the first time in the history of these United States

1479
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
The courts definitively declared

1480
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,039
That the second amendment gives every American

1481
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
The right to a gun for self-defense

1482
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:34,975
It was a it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution great day for citizens

1483
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,047
The great day for gun owners it was great day for

1484
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
Fearful people

1485
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,375
Of course

1486
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
Not everyone agreed

1487
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,703
I mean to me that's a travesty

1488
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
This is Jack Rico

1489
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,639
Professor of history and political science at Stanford University for the court and

1490
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
The history is just

1491
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
ROM

1492
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:00,831
The Second Amendment is not about individual right that we shouldn't even be talking

1493
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
About history

1494
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,487
Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time and that ultimately

1495
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,047
And here you go Justice Stevens in his

1496
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,863
Descent

1497
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
Android political stick

1498
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
Feathers all politics

1499
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
To be honest I mean I'd

1500
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,543
I don't really believe in constitutional law anymore

1501
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,847
I think a solution laws of fiction

1502
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,663
You know what's become so highly politicized

1503
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
In so many areas

1504
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,759
I think I socialize

1505
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Is bunk

1506
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,623
Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak

1507
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
Interfering the Judiciary

1508
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
But

1509
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
There's a very big

1510
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:47,935
But he did have a major caveat section of our opinion points out that like most rights the Second Amendment right

1511
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,751
He said like all right

1512
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,055
It's not absolute

1513
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,639
To keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever

1514
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
And for whatever purpose

1515
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,735
Which is very important to keep in mind

1516
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
Be taken to cast doubt

1517
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,063
Long-standing

1518
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
Possession of firearm

1519
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
You

1520
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,463
Or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms incense

1521
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
Places

1522
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,583
This is another thing that we tend to forget

1523
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
The decision says

1524
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,911
Every individual has a right to bear arms

1525
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,727
The most interesting lie like the decision also says

1526
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
Of course

1527
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
We need gun control

1528
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
The word Heller

1529
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Come to represent

1530
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
2nd Amendment rights

1531
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,759
Against Hillary even though

1532
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
Being for Heller

1533
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
Is being for gun control

1534
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
Fusing yeah it is

1535
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,439
I mean after all this time it's

1536
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Still just

1537
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
Totally confusing

1538
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
You have a right to a gun

1539
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
But the government has a right to regulate

1540
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,399
Decal gets his gun back in DC

1541
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,239
But PC still also has all sorts of gun regulation

1542
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,335
And you see the same pattern all over the country some states are lenient

1543
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
Summer super strict

1544
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:03,199
And both approaches seem to comply with Heller

1545
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,271
In a way the Heller Decision

1546
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:11,135
Is just like all those commas and Clauses that we started with and James Madison sentence

1547
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
It's the

1548
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,463
Confusing declaration

1549
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,535
That leaves the door wide open for interpretation

1550
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
Which

1551
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
Obviously suck

1552
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,223
We could use a little more

1553
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
Clarity on

1554
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
How to live with this

1555
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,111
Second Amendment right to bear arms

1556
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
Open it gives us an opportunity I think

1557
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:01,311
Opportunity to get it right to fix it

1558
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:07,711
But now be pretty good time

1559
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,743
Next gun show from more perfect and producer Sean Robbins firm

1560
