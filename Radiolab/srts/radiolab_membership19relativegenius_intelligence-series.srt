00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,608
Hi there this is Rachel Cusick I'm a producer here at the

00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,376
Show

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,680
We're going to go back to G in just a second

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
But first

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
EverQuest

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,800
Requests that only you can help me with

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
Did you know what it is and guys asking for money is hard I can only compare this feeling to bumping into an ex

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,088
Text with their new ridiculously good-looking partner while you're eating spaghetti you have your retainer in

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,440
And then someone asked you to recite Sally sells seashells by the seashore

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
It is awkward for everybody

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
But I am here

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,144
In your ears your listener asking for your hard-earned money

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,008
Guacamole as if I am the British guy in the magic bullet infomercial

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Standing

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,080
Because I believe in what we do

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
So much

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
And I know you do too

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,968
Over the last nine months and I have been diving deep

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
Into the world of intelligence

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
IRS

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,648
Oh you got me did nearly a hundred hours of interviews

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,304
Old-school original IQ test kit

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
This is never been used we can put ourselves through IQ test if I were a kid I would walk away from that crying and wanting for

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
Burger King

25
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Terrifying

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
I'm a full grown adult

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
And yet

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Stilts

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
We went inside Einstein's brain across the country to share their olestra story with you and we

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,088
We have more great stories coming your way that I won't spoil for you here

31
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,416
And we can do any of this kind of work without the help

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Listeners like you

00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,840
Radiolab is listener-supported which means you make this weird wonderful show possible

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
And now we need your help

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,496

Radio WNYC

51
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,136
Hate this is

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
I already live miniseries

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
I'm Pat Walters

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And I'm Rachel Cusick

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,352
End at today we're going to go looking for intelligence in what made

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Deam Lake

57
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
One of the more

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Obvious

59
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Okay

60
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Do you need water

61
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Yeah

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Atwater's okay

63
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
And the story starts with this guy

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Play my name is Steven Levy

65
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Imma editor-at-large

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,040
At Wired Magazine thank you so much for coming and basically I guess

67
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
Where did this all start for you

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
So in 1978 I was working

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
4 magazine called New Jersey monthly

70
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
He was young fresh out of school

71
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Real job in journalism

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,936
Officers were in a suburb outside Princeton New Jersey Office Park

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
A very Bland

74
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
Set of offices with cubicles

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Yeah really Dunder Mifflin ish

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Defense it was a typical boring entry level job

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Until this one day we got a new attitude or you got interested

78
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Yeah

79
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Ecommons office

80
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
I said I want you to find

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Einstein's brain

82
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
And I thought what we like

83
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,583
That's exciting or you would like pretty cool

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,703
I've been working on a piece about the psychology of the New Jersey driver

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Write literally did a service piece about racquetball

86
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
This is better

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
The reason the editor assigned him

88
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
The story

89
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Is there Benny's rumors

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Going back years

91
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,999
That when Einstein died back in 1955

92
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Moments after his death

93
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
Someone had literally stolen his brain

94
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
And run

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
Urban legend Einstein's brain is somewhere and you know that

96
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Now that the Russians have it and

97
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:08,735
Clone Einstein

98
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
It literally said to me I want you to find Einstein

99
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
What did you know about Einstein at that point in his brain

100
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Street with no at Einstein

101
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Pine essential oil

102
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
This guy the funny hair relativity right whatever that was

103
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
What do you would quickly learn something to do with the atom

104
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
After a little bit of reading

105
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Is that

106
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
In the early 20th century

107
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,967
Einstein pretty much rewrote the way that we thought the universe works

108
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,343
Einstein brilliant physicist and theoretical mathematician

109
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
She said that mass is equivalent energy equals MC square light to the atomic bomb

110
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
Devastation in time and space to bend

111
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,287
Let's discover black holes and like a million other things being able to last on the total

112
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
And it didn't take long before Einstein

113
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Just became a symbol do you think you're smarter than Einstein

114
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
Einstein

115
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
So that was Steve's assignment

116
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Find the brain of the guy

117
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Whose name basically means

118
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Then he said by the way this is going to be

119
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
Are cover in August

120
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Do week 6 weeks away or something

121
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
NFL odds

122
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,207
How do you even begin looking for the brain of a guy that died decades ago

123
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
The richest thing

124
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
The library and

125
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
So new that Einstein lived in Princeton

126
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
Undine Princeton April 1955 so he headed over to the local public library

127
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
People archive

128
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Microfilm

129
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,455
And he finds this article a couple days after Einstein die

130
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
And it's at Einstein's brain be preserved for study

131
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
And it talked about

132
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Yeah there's going to be a study of Einstein's brain and

133
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Yeah we are going to have a press conference

134
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:34,655
So he pulls up the next day's paper and King will be a big front-page story about this press conference

135
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Cricket's nothing

136
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
There was no press conf

137
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
No

138
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
So many things

139
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay that's 23 years ago

140
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
You have a brain study

141
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Something's got to be public

142
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Lake by scientist

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
I went through all sorts of

144
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Scientific

145
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Periodic

146
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Guards

147
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
No papers

148
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Am I really loud fart

149
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
And eventually he realizes

150
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
That little newspaper article that was literally

151
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
That was the last thing written

152
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
About Einstein's brain

153
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
But there was one clue

154
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
And that little newspaper article

155
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
A name

156
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
The name of the guy who was supposed to hold that press conference

157
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
The Never

158
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Dr. Thomas Harvey

159
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Who it seemed

160
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,015
In addition to being the guy who didn't hold that press conference

161
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,111
Was also the pathologist who would have done the autopsy on Einstein

162
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
So the next step on Steve search hospital and we're supposedly this Harvey

163
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
At work. And I went there I found

164
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
What's the vice president

165
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
I asked him about the phone with you

166
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Sky dr. Thomas Harvey

167
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Where is dr. Harvey

168
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Hospital guy says he left you a long time ago

169
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,063
Venti Pike what about the brain I heard the brain got taken is it here at the hospital need to know anything I put talk to talk to Harvey

170
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
So what do you do to find Harvey

171
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
So when I was looking for a person

172
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
In 1978 there's no Google

173
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Yeah there's no Facebook there's no LinkedIn

174
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
So and there's a lot of

175
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Places

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,727
Bata city is in every city

177
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Phone book

178
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
But

179
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
You been looking every phone

180
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Yeah I eventually figured

181
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,687
One place I might go is the American medic

182
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
Figured this guy Harvey was a doctor maybe they have his contact info

183
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
So I called them up

184
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
I'm trying to find this

185
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135

186
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695

187
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
In Wichita Kansas

192
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,567
So he calls directory assistance in Wichita says you guys have a number for a Thomas Harvey

193
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
They said yes

194
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Yes

195
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Is that number listed

196
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
I said yes

00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Make a bee

198
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
His phone number

199
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,551
And I took a deep breath and dial the phone number

200
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Back then

201
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Someone wasn't there

202
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415

00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Hang up

00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Buddy pick up phone

206
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303

Eye doctor Harvey ND

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Yes and I said disaster

211
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Dr. Harvey who worked at Princeton Hospital

212
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
In 1950

213
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
85

214
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
I never said

215
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Pause

216
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
I figured

217
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,439
Is a yes or no question right either supposed like he was almost debating

218
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Weather today

219
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
And finally said yes

220
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
The retrospect maybe was little The Jig Is Up

221
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
And

222
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
He said why don't know if I can help you

223
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
And

224
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,199
I said well I just like to talk to you

225
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Well

226
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
And he was sort of

227
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,903
Not saying yes or no I'm coming out there to talk

228
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
So I booked a ticket for

229
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327

230
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Department of Labor Kansas

231
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
He spends the night

232
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
And then the next morning he wakes up get the cab and goes over to Harvey's lab

233
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Ring the bell or whatever

234
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
And dr. Harvey

235
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Came to open the door for

236
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
What did he look like

237
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
He look like

238
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503

These bring a lab coat

242
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
And I remember very clearly

243
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Yanez pocket Windows pens

244
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
They could write in three colors

245
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Are red

246
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Green blue

247
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
MP3 back

248
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
To the back of the

249
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Facility of

250
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
To his

251
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Office was basically

252
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Eyeglass in Cuba

253
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
And with a desk

254
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Ana chair

255
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Michelle

256
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Cardboard boxes

257
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
And I sat down and we talked

258
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
Now at this point Harvey hadn't admitted to anything

259
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
But Steve had a feeling

260
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
A definite feeling

261
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Yeah you can tell he's very cautious Right Guard

262
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
Asking every way to try to figure out

263
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Where's the brain.

264
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
A few times

265
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Yeah where's the brain

266
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
And he really want to answer that

267
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,847
Pictures of it and then he should have broke down

268
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
When I guess

269
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Yakame because he

270
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Because I was so fun

271
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Frustrated

272
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Yeah I was like no pictures even

273
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
And he's like

274
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Saga little

275
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
So he gets up

276
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Any walks

277
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
Behind me there's really a beer cooler near me

278
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
How big is in the beer cooler nowicki

279
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Mountain Pass weather

280
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
And goes behind me

281
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Two were one of the cardboard box

282
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Staples out these two jars

283
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And in one of the jars

284
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
There are these

285
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Pieces of

286
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Biomass

287
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
14er

288
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
They're clearly

289
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Brain

290
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
M

291
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Starion

292
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
And

293
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,583
Thunderstruck

294
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Movies like

295
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
A joke you know

296
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,983
This was amazing I mean yeah you can hear

297
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
Yeah whatever the chorus of angels singing

298
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
I'm taking this in

299
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Ended like this

300
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Is the brain

301
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
That changed the world

302
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
And the Sea. Brain

303
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Was

304
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
The movie experience

305
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
I got in this glimpse

306
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Absolutely

307
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Of what though

308
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
Something big or something you know

309
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Mystery

310
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
It follows Pampas precios

311
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
In this episode

312
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
We're going to try to untangle Batman

313
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
Manifestation

314
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
X15

315
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,839
What can the brain of one of the greatest Geniuses that Humanity has ever produced

316
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
Unfamiliar concept

317
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
Intelius

318
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
Well I'm just going to say for the record that I think that's silly

319
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
And I think that brain is a whole it is though

320
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:52,415
I do not but I am going to bring my exam

321
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,791
I would just like to declare my bias I don't think there is anything special about his brain

322
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Anything not even I mean you think he was brilliant

323
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
There's something about the idea that is genius is

324
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
Tied to the physical structure of his brain that makes me

325
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Itchy

326
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
Literally as physical sensation I have I start to itch

327
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
Yeah I think you're dismissing it too soon I think there's more to it

328
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Then

329
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Eustace bagge

330
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Alright let me ask you more basic

331
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
What's the what's the fellas name again

332
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Thomas Harvey

333
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
How did he end up with that brain to begin with

334
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Well

335
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
You know

336
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,679
Dictate to answer your question this is dr. Fred Lepore he's a neurologist

337
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
Book about Einstein

338
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
It only people talk to you to answer that very question

339
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
And he says you got to go back to the winter of 1950

340
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,711
Einstein was living on borrowed time 76 years old

341
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Retired living in Princeton

342
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
And get sick

343
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Start feel this pain in his abdomen

344
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
It was almost like a gallbladder attack

345
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
Turned out to be way worse than that

346
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Ultimately

347
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
An abdominal aortic aneurysm

348
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
Franklin who was a neurosurgeon

349
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Surgeon at Cornell came down ready to operate

350
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
But I sign basically said look I am you know

351
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
My time is up I I will die I think he's I will die Allegan

352
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
He knew he was and that was a brave thing to say because he was in pain

353
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
Eventually in the spring of 1955

354
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,343
Einstein under the hospital Friday died this morning after refusing surgery

355
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
Wechat turned off would not have helped him recover from a ruptured artery

356
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,047
As the story goes in the early morning hours of April 18th murdered a couple of in comprehensible words

357
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Incomprehensible to his nurse who didn't speak German

358
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
And then

359
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
In the early morning hours

360
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Just found dead

361
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,615
Note on Harvey our guy was the chief pathologist at Princeton.

362
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
His job was to do autopsy

363
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
And that night

364
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
April 18th 1955

365
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
He's at home

366
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Sleeping

367
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
And

368
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
You get the call

369
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Yeah I think the phone call came sometime before Dawn and it was Einstein's personal

370
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Mission

371
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
Who called him to let him know

372
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,167
The Einstein's son had given permission for an autopsy to be performed on his father

373
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,007
This is Carolyn Abraham science journalist author of

374
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Possessing genius

375
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
The story of the bizarre Odyssey of Einstein's brain

376
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
Hardy actually died in 2007

377
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
But before he did Carolyn spend some time with him

378
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
And got his take on that day

379
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
He gets himself ready and

380
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
He remembered it was a really nice morning

381
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
A spring was in the air and your things were turning green and he was walking towards what

382
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
He realized was going to be a major opportunity in his professional life

383
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
He got to that hospital and he got to his Pathology lab and someone that morning

384
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,735
Had already placed Einstein on the autopsy table

385
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
She says he walked into the room

386
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Einstein playing there

387
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
Flat on the table

388
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
Picked up a scalpel now he open the abdomen and he saw it was full of blood from the aneurysm so he establishes cause

389
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Cause of death

390
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Did a routine examination of the heart

391
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Then he did something that was not in the script

392
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
He remove the top of the skull

393
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
Cut a bunch of cranial nerves

394
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
And arteries

395
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
And he took the brain out

396
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
And then you put the brain

397
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
In a jar

398
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
End

399
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Walked out

400
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
So he literally just

401
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Stole the brain out of

402
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Einstein skull

403
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Just stole it

404
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Yeah

405
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Which is

406
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Pretty gross

407
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
It's not a crime

408
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Probably history has not been kind to Thomas as Harvey

409
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
But in Tom Harvey

410
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,911
Estimation and he actually put it this way in our conversations once

411
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
As that he would have felt ashamed

412
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
If he didn't take it

413
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,847
She's not here was ashamed because here was this opportunity

414
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
To learn

415
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Something about sort of the biological underpinnings of intelligence of Genius onofre

416
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,415
From arguably we are certainly one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century and

417
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
To not study it would have been

418
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Negligent

419
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,143
Courtney Carolyn however misguided it might seem Harvey says he wasn't taking the brain from South

420
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
You taking it for

421
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
All of us

422
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Bike for Humanity

423
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
First time

424
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
But

425
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:29,151
Best work the next day the family at this point or read on the front page of the April 19th New York

426
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
55 New York Times read that

427
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
The brain was preserved for science

428
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
And they were flabbergasted

429
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Timeout heard of it

430
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Yeah in the paper

431
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,767
Find out

432
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,399
Yep the family didn't know and didn't give permission the understanding although you'll find none of this in the will

433
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
But the understanding was

434
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
Einstein would be cremated and his

435
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Ashes scattered in a secret location so that quote-unquote no one could come and worship at my bones

436
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
He was the first scientist

437
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Become a public figure

438
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Electra

439
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Camden ar time

440
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,135
Ice cream is always very uncomfortable with

441
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
The attention that celebrity brought with

442
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
He was really afraid that people are going to start to see him as something superhuman

443
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
True science

444
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Its power

445
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
I linked with Einsteins image

446
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,591
It speaks to the fact that in the twentieth century science sort of displaced religion

447
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
As

448
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
What

449
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
People put their face in

450
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
And he was going to start of its high priest

451
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
And so he didn't want his grave site

452
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
2B, shrine

453
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,415
That's why you wanted to be cremated as he was

454
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
On April

455
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
18th

456
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
But Harvey kept the brain

457
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
So the family went they saw the headline do they do they knock on Harvey's door and I want to say what the hell

458
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
No they found the hospital they phone Princeton hospital and they're very upset

459
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Eventually

460
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Hans Albert

461
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Einstein Galveston

462
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Get on the phone with

463
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Tom Hardy

464
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
Now we don't know exactly what they said to each other

465
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
You probably imagined Hans Albert was

466
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
That probably be yelled at Tom Harvey

467
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,000
Tom Harvey apparently apologized for taking it without permission Dad finally

468
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Harvey makes

469
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
The picture of his wife

470
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
He says you know this isn't you know the mind for all the ages we're never going to get this opportunity again and I pledged that

471
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,592
I will do a scholarly study made this very solemn vow

472
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,712
To take care of this brain to not allow it to become sort of an object of

473
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
Fascination Tom Hardy told Hans Albert he'd never let the brain become a spectacle he honor Einstein

474
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
Adjust Adidas brain

475
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,536
It might reveal something The Secret of human genius and creativity

476
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
You can't pass it up

477
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
And the Sun

478
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Honda Robertson

479
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
You can study at

480
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
But only as long as it's serious science

481
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
No spec

482
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
So the next step that Harvey has

483
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,760
He's trying to craft a kind of a do-it-yourself

484
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
Approach to studying a famous brain even though he's a doctor

485
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
Carby's not trained in

486
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,512
In an in this kind of neuropathology he learned some but not to the degree that especially

487
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
What's the weather

488
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Spends evenings taking photographs

489
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
He weighs that he measures it hit some standard textbooks different reference guides one of the really interesting things he did

490
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,080
Did during this. He brought this artist into

491
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Paint a portrait of Einstein's brain

492
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,016
We really went when it was whole he said he just wanted to have it and he never did hang that

493
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
That painting really

494
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
One-time thing thing to do I think partly it was because he knew what Pat to happen next door and he

495
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,512
His estimation what he was going to do next

496
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,584
He's going to cut the brain into 240SX

497
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
And after that he goes across the Delaware George Washington or something to University of

498
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,944
Pennsylvania where there's a technician who had worked with gave her some of those jumps of rain

499
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
And she's like family

500
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
Into microscope slides

501
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Cinema 12

502
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:26,208
Smoke Clears and I'm sorry

503
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,072
Untold 12 sets of at least 200 slides per set

504
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,888
And his job for the next few years

505
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,728
Is the try to take it individually to various

506
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,056
Neuropathologist who might be able to study this brain

507
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
So I resend that slide

508
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Photos and samples of Einstein's brain he was trying to collaborate with experts in the field

509
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
Specialist we don't exactly know

510
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
How many photographs he gave out how many slides who he gave them to

511
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
There's a lot

512
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,704
Despite all the effort though there's no record of them ever getting back to him or doing anything of

513
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Importance

514
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
From the few scientists I was able to contact at that time who received those pieces

515
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
If you were still alive

516
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
They said they didn't really know what they should be looking for

517
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Which of course was

518
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
True

519
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
This is where Tom Harvey ran into the reality of

520
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
You know neuroscience at that time everything

521
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
As a complex beginning in our brain

522
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
At that point I just figure out

523
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
What neurons do are the communicate back and forth

524
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
Brain alone has 10000

525
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
They hadn't even scratch the surface of absurd of the understanding

526
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,368
A normal brain let alone trying to

527
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Solve the mystery of genius and Einstein's brain

528
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
So years and years go by

529
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
End

530
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Nothing

531
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
But now we wouldn't give up

532
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,472
He knew it was of significance he thought there was something that could be learned and he never abandon that and I think at this point

533
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,080
Harvey began to see himself as kind of a living time capsule

534
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,016
He was going to take this brain with him into the future when science

535
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
Would be equipped to study of properly

536
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
But

537
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
In the meantime

538
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,024
Arby's life falls apart

539
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Affair

540
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
He got divorced

541
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,496
He loses his job at Princeton

542
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah he does

543
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
That is until 1978

544
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
When a young reporter from New Jersey

545
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Knock on his door

546
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Asking about it

547
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,440
Turn airplane home when did you call your editor or something on your way the first thing I did

548
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
I went straight to my

549
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Etter's house

550
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
And he was like

551
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Watching a basketball

552
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
We watched a little of basketball

553
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
And without saying anyway

554
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
And finally said he will

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Joe find a brain

556
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:28,480
That's what you tell him that's like you would hold it for halftime virus

557
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Was it I had to write it

558
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
We got a great image for the cover

559
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Cuddling with my search for Einstein's brain

560
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
And then

561
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
One of the people who got the press release

562
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
This was

563
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
So in the story came out

564
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Baby rattlesnake

565
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
And

566
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,568
It was in every newspaper in the country

567
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
Johnny Carson made a joke

568
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
Oh really

569
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
If you remember you about the brain

570
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
Did they really Einstein's brain

571
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
What is one of the guy to Wichita come like that

572
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,976
Yeah and

573
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
Dr. Harvey

574
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Have people camped out in this lawn

575
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
Really drive everyone out

576
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
It was

577
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
You have a lot of it

578
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
The Einstein estate

579
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Went bonkers

580
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
I mean this is exactly what they didn't want to happen

581
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,664
People keep calling they were cash offers for the brain

582
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,272
People all over the place started to write to him to volunteer to become its next

583
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
Keeper in the offer to money

584
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
So not only did Harvey

585
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,696
Fail to come up with any science about the brain

586
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
BFF broke that promise you made to the family

587
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Because of all the attention

588
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
At least on the science side

589
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
His luck

590
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,736
Kind of changed one place to pick up the story was Science magazine

591
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
By the late 70s

592
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
Neuroscience had picked up a woman

593
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Two new techniques

594
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
Exploring brains

595
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Have been developed

596
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,888
For example we figured out there were opioid receptors in the brain

597
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,264
Millions of these sensory receptors and had developed a treatment for Parkinson's

598
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Soap scientist at this point we're just slightly more equipped

599
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
And Wednesday story came out

600
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
Actually kicked off

601
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Real research

602
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Into Einstein's brain

603
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,064
Bed directly flowed from my making it

604
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
So what happened

605
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
So the first thing that happens

606
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
Is he got the call from this

607
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Scientist names

608
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
My name is Marian diamond. Diamond

609
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
That's a good name

610
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Brightening

611
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
Choose a professor of anatomy at Berkeley on campus

612
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Carrying a box

613
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
She got excited coming to class

614
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Kiewit

615
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,784
I never seen a human brain before freshman Anatomy lecture in front of all these

616
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,184
Skip by bring a hat box onto the table and open it is like a flower print half buck

617
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,768
Turn it up and pull out this brain cyst Mass only weighs

618
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
3 lb

619
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,864
And yet it has the capacity

620
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
To conceive

621
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Other universe

622
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
A billion light years

623
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Across

624
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
Some people call her one of the founders of modern neuroscience

625
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Isn't that phenomenal

626
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Alaska

627
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
The protoplasm

628
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Do that

629
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
So she did these studies on rats

630
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Which became very famous

631
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,600
Where she figured out that if you like put a rat in an enriched

632
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,904
Environment sowa cage with like a lot

633
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
Toys things to climb around on and lots of other rat friends to hang out with instead of just putting them in like the boring

634
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Normal cage

635
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
What you'll find

636
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
Is that their brains

637
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Actually

638
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,008
Change. More of these little cells called glial cells switch

639
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
For a long time people thought glial cells were just like

640
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,736
The scaffolding of the brain like neurons where the action was that throughout the thinking happened

641
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
And glial cells were just like

642
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
You know the

643
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
This dis

644
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Studs and mortar of the

645
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Houston that I'm holding everything

646
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Together

647
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,048
But around this time when Marian Diamond was doing the studies are starting to realize that the

648
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Glial cells

649
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
Also had neurotransmitters flowing through them

650
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
Like that they might be more important than we thought

651
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
But shortly after she publishes her rat

652
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Studies

653
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
She

654
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Here's about Harvey

655
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:44,992
She saw you know a little piece about it in the journal science and so she started to track down Harvey and she call

656
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,832
Call Tim in 1984 Harvey Center for chunks of brain

657
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,160
She went looking and Einstein's brain to see if there was

658
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
You know something similar to what she had been recording in her animal

659
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,584
Experiments and she finds that compared to the average brain

660
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Einstein had a lot

661
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Of glial cells

662
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
What's what's a lot

663
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
I like twice as many three times as many

664
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
What about 70% more than the control group

665
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
But what does that even mean

666
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
I don't

667
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,432
Really know how to describe that which is part of the problem and on top of that

668
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
After she published This research

669
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Some other scientists race

670
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,368
Questions that maybe the experimental methods were invalid

671
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Stove

672
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Not convinced yeah me neither

673
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
So that diamond

674
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Diamond

675
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:34,400
So after Diamond then describe Britt Anderson comes along and his whole thing he studied five other

676
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Adult male

677
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Dead brands

678
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
He looked at their prefrontal cortex has

679
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,408
And that's like where higher cognitive abilities are located so like if you're going to take a test that's the part of your brain is going to be active

680
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
Cheated and he found that compared to the other brands that he had the neurons and Einstein's brain were more

681
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Tightly packed

682
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
To his neurons were more tightly packed

683
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
In a certain part of a

684
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
Yeah three of more neurons that part or less neurons

685
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Same number roughly

686
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
They're just more crowded together

687
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
What is that

688
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
Say I kind of take that as like

689
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
Einstein problem-solving abilities

690
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,776
Could go much more quickly and efficiently

691
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,128
Yeah actually pretty Anderson the guy who found this

692
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,248
He dismisses himself and he found a difference but he also was quick to say like

693
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
We just have one of these brands

694
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
He said listen you know I

695
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
It was always going to be a

696
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,256
An NF1 in any experiment you kind of like the middle child of all these researchers you made like the smallest

697
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Splash

698
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
It is through Britt Anderson

699
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
That Tom Harvey hears about Sandra Wilson in Canada and that was like the biggest splash of them all really yes

700
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,592
Sandra Mendelson in the fall of 1995 she ends up getting this back

701
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
A one-page fax

702
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,504
From a man by the name of Thomas Harvey and the back basically says hey

703
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Heard about your research

704
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
Would you like to study the brain of Albert Einstein it almost seems like you were suspected to be a prank

705
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
Just being mad

706
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,864
Exactly but you know obviously she faxed back yes and so

707
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,448
Harvey hop in the car with the brain brains in the trunk actually

708
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
And drives North to bring to bring the brain to Canada

709
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,640
And the reason he was so excited to have her look at the brain what had really

710
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,480
Caught his attention was the fact that she had this collection of normal brains

711
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,552
She's been doing this long term before and after study

712
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
So years before she died. In this group together basically like they signed up they took IQ tests they did all these things while they were still alive

713
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Live

714
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
Stream and then when they died she got to study their brains to see like

715
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
A before-and-after picture of these people's brains

716
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,704
Willie. Smart people so she had a mix

717
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,544
But the ones that she compared Einstein's brain to wear all high IQ men

718
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
So she makes this comparison

719
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Einstein brain vs these other brains in her collection

720
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
And she write this article

721
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Of the article

722
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:04,416
Was that he had unusual parietal lobes usual Primal low Bridal lobes of Einsteins

723
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Brain for anatomically

724
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Exceptional if you will

725
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,536
Where is the parietal lobes again

726
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,888
Can I wear your baseball cap is like mainly

727
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,960
The back or if you had animal exactly

728
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,824
And this area of your brain this is where all of your sensory information comes in

729
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
And because of that is also where your visual spatial awareness is located so like the way that you

730
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
You Orient yourself in the world is

731
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
Bug mostly located in that part of your brain

732
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,392
Like if you were to close your eyes right now and you think

733
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
Where my hands

734
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Where are my knees

735
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
For my feet

736
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,608
Well you have an internal mental map that's telling you where those things are and that's your parietal lobe doing that

737
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Anyhow

738
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
So what was different about this part of Einstein's brain is that if you imagine the brains look like a walnut which is kind of the only way.

739
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
I imagine the brain

740
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
There are like all these grooves and crevices

741
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,016
And there's this one Groove like a groovy groovy like a deeper crevice called the Sylvian fissure

742
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
In Einstein's brain it was shorter than the rest of ours

743
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
And apparently that's very strange when she described it to me she said it was enough to see this unique pattern in Einstein's brain

744
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Was a striking as

745
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
Seeing a face

746
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
With

747
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
The eyebrows beneath the eyes

748
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,520
And Sandra Wilson proposed that maybe because this crevice was a little bit shorter

749
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,592
The electricity in this part of his brain could go much more quickly

750
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,944
How to travel around in half

751
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
I could just go

752
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,064
So speculative

753
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
Yes and so she was saying like the parietal lobe like this is where

754
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
His genius might be

755
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
End

756
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
If you hang about Einstein like everybody says like one of his greatest Talent is like the way that he could manipulate shapes and it mine

757
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Find

758
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Orient object

759
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
In his head I mean just like the idea that

760
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
SpaceTime is

761
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,848
Curved so he has is kind of great visuospatial

762
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,176
If you had to pick a part of your brain that could

763
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,760
Underlie mathematical abilities or visual spatial abilities

764
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Left parietal lobe

765
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,392
Looking at these papers you see Thomas Harvey's name is like the co-author

766
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
He was a coop

767
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:18,048
Yeah he's like cited in the paper made my heart Happy like you made it

768
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:23,168
Especially for Sandra Wilson because he all these years have been like shepherding this forward

769
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
And when that paper came out I think

770
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Tom Harvey felt

771
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Then that

772
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
That his work

773
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
Was over cuz he felt at that point it did they hit

774
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,736
Pointed to something that was real at Ruby felt like finally

775
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
The work that he promised to do in the very beginning

776
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Was finally done

777
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
And at that point

778
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,416
He actually decided to give the brain

779
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Back

780
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
2

781
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,280
I Princeton hospital in the care of

782
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,864
Elliot Krause basically the pathologist who holds the same job

783
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,448
He did when he first took that rain in 1955

784
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
You know it

785
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Some

786
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
It's kind of uncanny that it's back where it was

787
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Yeah

788
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
I'm going to rain on this parade

789
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
I'm happy for mr. Harvey

790
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
But

791
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
In terms of the science

792
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
You convinced me a little bit

793
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
Comedian bit

794
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,440
But still kind of smells like phrenology to me

795
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,792
I mean it's like I'm listening to it that the experience I have is like

796
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Sylvian fissure

797
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
And then I think to myself

798
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Is a Sylvian fissure

799
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:35,360
I don't even know what that is like the fact that like we so clearly default to this fascination with a thing that I don't think

800
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Can you explain it

801
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
It just kind of seemed absurd

802
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
And we know that he said that like

803
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
He didn't think he was a

804
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
Particularly special

805
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Guy

806
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,904
Think he said various does lots of Courts for memories talks about saying like

807
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,000
I was just in the right place at the right time or I'm just say that

808
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,840
Really yeah you know what he's talking about his famous cousin quote about

809
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,144
Worrying that the packaging

810
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Of him

811
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
Is better than the meat inside

812
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:06,080
I mean this is part of the

813
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,152
Method him is like and he was very humble

814
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Is another one we talked about like

815
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,784
He sometimes talks about what made him special with his stubbornness

816
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
But he was really obstinate and he wouldn't let things go

817
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
That's when the only things I feel like you hear him talking about

818
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Add some innate

819
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
Characteristic of him that made him different than other people

820
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352
But didn't he never talked about being smart she never talks about

821
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Brain

822
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
I feel like we've been swimming around it for a while

823
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
His brain

824
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Hammer

825
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,664
But it is interesting that he says he he was in the right place at the right time

826
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,760
Which can sound kind of like humble but also maybe it's sleepy

827
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
You take it seriously maybe there's something to it

828
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Yeah I mean it like

829
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
We've been talking about the neural connections inside

830
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,512
But you can also think about it a little more broadly

831
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
Like about the connections

832
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Outsiders

833
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,960
Almost as if the neurons didn't stop inside his skull but like continued outward

834
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240

How do I

843
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
We have an eviction epidemic

844
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
I'm too often we fail to grasp

845
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
What that is

846
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
But it isn't sometimes when you look at stuff on the news why is she somewhere on the pole dancing and she should be home

847
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
We're children

848
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Any answer is

Jiu Jitsu reset I was intrigued

856
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
Buy the thing you said at the end of the last chapter that

857
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,648
You know there are the circuits in in his head but then what about the circus outside is that

858
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Maybe you just got lucky

859
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
What were you thinking of when you said

860
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,560
Yeah I mean a lot of the obvious things that

861
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Must be dead

862
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
Einstein was

863
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Building on the work

864
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Lots of other physicists

865
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
Pointer and Lorenz to have been chipping away at the same

866
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Questions

867
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Puzzled him

868
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
So there's that

869
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
But if you widen the lens a little boy

870
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
Let me start to think more broadly

871
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
You start to see

872
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,272
Something really interesting

873
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Got a bigger

874
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
Forces that were at work on Einstein

875
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Wings coming up

876
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Like

877
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Just take

878
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
Special relativity

879
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
Which most people would say it's one of his most Revolution

880
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Share ideas

881
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Special relativity

882
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Special relativity proper length

883
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
Very basically is the idea that

884
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Time is relative

885
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
And that

886
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Time slows down

887
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
As you go fat

888
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
So if you're going a million miles an hour

889
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
10 miles an hour

890
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
I'm will literally

891
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Slow down

892
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Images

893
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,736
Seems lower it will actually be

894
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
I feel like this is the moment when

895
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
Science and Common Sense

896
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Parted ways

897
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
It's such a weird idea

898
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Totally

899
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Well that idea

900
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,560
I came from Einstein but also kind of came from

901
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
The world around

902
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:45,472
Okay so I'm going to give you a couple of really interesting examples that we came across as we research

903
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Okay

904
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:53,151
Number one I'm not in it at all an expert on the brain Story I mean look at some of the same things that you have but

905
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Come from the sky

906
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Could you introduce yourself

907
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
I'm Peter galison I'm a

908
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,343
Professor at Harvard University where I work on the history and philosophy

909
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
If science and Dawn

910
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
Physics and what Peter told us

911
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:08,767
Is a if you look at when Einstein came up with the idea of special relativity

912
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
1905

913
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,959
Destroy the dolphin told is Einstein was working in the patent office just sitting around all by himself thinking

914
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Take thoughts

915
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
But you look at what was actually happening at that moment

916
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,407
Like outside this was a transformative moment in the technological history of the world

917
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,063
Yeah what were what were some of the big like the hot inventions happening you looked out the window

918
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
Any central European or Western European city

919
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
You would see

920
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
New kinds of trams being installed electric motors you would see

921
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,031
Networks of clocks that were established UNC

922
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,639
I also a new devices that are being invented that could

923
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,223
Send signals the extension of the telegraph Network

924
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
Everything in motion everything in the chain

925
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
And

926
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
As a consequence

927
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Time is

928
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Has suddenly become

929
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
Atopic of immense in

930
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
Not just because the world seem to be moving faster

931
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
The first time in human history

932
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,775
You could be in several different time

933
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
At 1

934
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
Cuz you ran trains

935
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
So you leave Chicago at

936
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
3 p.m.

937
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
When you get to a distant City

938
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
What time is it there

939
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Do use the time

940
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
But you started with in Chicago do you use

941
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
The time

942
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Did you arriving at in Philadelphia

943
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Who sets

944
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
What are the times you know before the railroad

945
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Time was local

946
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
Every town had like its own time

947
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,263
Set in each town by the local jeweler who repaired and made clocks and watch

948
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,055
Open with the railroad you needed

949
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:02,175
Central Time in the early skirmishes over whose time would become

950
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
The time

951
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
Especially to the Showbox

952
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,575
It's like a million years ago it's a big big didn't like that at all

953
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
But suddenly the ability

954
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
To Traverse at a fairly high speed

955
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
Hundreds even thousands of miles

956
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Created the demand

957
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Think about

958
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
What time was

959
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
And how to coordinate

960
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
That was sort of the mood of the MoMA

961
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
Like just outside the window

962
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
A patent office

963
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,055
Where Einstein was sitting there thinking big thoughts

964
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,919
And what are the specific questions he was wrestling with

965
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
Was the one Peter just threw out

966
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,551
Like how would you coordinate two different clocks in two different cities

967
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,367
A lot of people the time.

968
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
We do it is you send an Alexa

969
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
Signal bike through a telegraph wire from one to the other

970
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,655
Calculate the amount of time it would take that signal to get from the first clock to the second clock then you take that minuscule amount of time until

971
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
Attractive from 1:00

972
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Or at it when the clock

973
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,287
And then you have the same time in two places

974
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
And that's part of the problem

975
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
But then the next.

976
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,199
That was

977
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
What is that signal you were using was traveling at the

978
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Speed of light

979
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
What does to clock

980
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
What if one of them was moved

981
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
Equals movie

982
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,951
And the light was tired of chasing it

983
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Wouldn't it take

984
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
The light longer to get there

985
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,839
And wouldn't that like

986
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Screw up your

987
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Whole ability to

988
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Coordinate

989
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Why am I telling you this

990
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
Because

991
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
These kinds of questions

992
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
They sort of infiltrated Einstein

993
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Dreams

994
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:40,223
Einstein wrote about this in his autobiography so we have a very good idea

995
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,575
That semantic analysis of science at the University of Illinois

996
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
She says Einstein wrote about these very particular Daydreams yet he said the P imagine himself

997
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
Be propelled through space chasing after

998
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
A light beam

999
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
And and thought

1000
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,703
Stories of signs of biographers to Feinstein

1001
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:06,079
Often agreed that it was that sort of experiment of of seeing in a what actually happens

1002
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
If I pursue a light beam. Had the provided the the yard

1003
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
Turn off his thoughts the theory of relativity

1004
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,903
And explain why that light beam was such a big deal in a minute but the mean thing him and wanted to

1005
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,487
The tell me about it what that is explained as something that just emerged

1006
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
From Einstein's brain

1007
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
I think it was purely an original

1008
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Idea of her

1009
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
But it was not his idea at all

1010
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Printed mint

1011
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
A story hero

1012
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Lead him to it

1013
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
She does Einstein love science

1014
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,479
And he said he was particularly taken

1015
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,295
Bye-bye one author the name is

1016
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
I run

1017
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Bernstein

1018
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
Who wrote quite a few volumes

1019
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,463
And Einstein says that he if he brought them with quote

1020
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Breathless attention

1021
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,607
Infinisys the story that got Einstein thinking about chasing light beams

1022
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,679
Was about a faster-than-light travel

1023
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,751
And what happens if we travel faster than the speed

1024
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Safelite

1025
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,615
The story of imagine that you could have a guy who shoots off into space

1026
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
And purchased himself on a star

1027
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,271
We looks back at Earth

1028
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,855
Isn't the same Earth he left a different world at different

1029
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Universe

1030
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Earlier

1031
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,023
Because as Bernstein explains when we look out at anything in space

1032
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
Square knot

1033
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Being it

1034
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
Exactly as it is

1035
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
But rather as it was

1036
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Example when you look up

1037
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,239
Son you're really seeing the Sun

1038
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
8 minutes in the past

1039
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Because the light waves

1040
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
Take time to

1041
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
To reach you and because this Traveler

1042
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
To travel fast

1043
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Jordan light

1044
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
All you need to

1045
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Enough if

1046
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
If you wanted to look at the Earth

1047
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
8 minutes in the past all you needed

1048
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
Go to the Sun

1049
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
And if you

1050
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,719
Jumping to further and farther a planets and stars

1051
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,303
Then you can choose whatever time in history you want to see

1052
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,911
Turn the story this traveler could Bounce from that first star to a planet

1053
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
To another star

1054
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
And another

1055
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
And another

1056
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,639
Quotes in one point in Space the light of the scenes of the French Revolution is just coming into view

1057
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,015
It's even farther away the invasion of The Barbarians has just become the order of the day

1058
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
Alexander the Great

1059
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
Conquering the world

1060
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
Historical events that have long been dead for us

1061
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
We'll just be coming to life

1062
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
By the way

1063
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
This was one of the first

1064
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
Time travel stories

1065
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Inhibit

1066
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
Which is crazy to think about

1067
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,727
3000 years

1068
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Human ride

1069
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031
And almost nobody

1070
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
That point

1071
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,663
At imagine someone going back in time or going into the future

1072
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,527
The stories that today are so much apart movies and culture

1073
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
They all basically started

1074
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
At the time Einstein was growing up

1075
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
He just happened to be alive

1076
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
At that time

1077
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
Amanda says

1078
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
They opened his mind

1079
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,887
He said that the stories really prompted him to imagine himself

1080
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
Be propelled through space

1081
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Chasing after

1082
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
A light beam

1083
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,871
And the reason that mental image was so pivotal

1084
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Who's that right around the time it popped into

1085
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
Other physicists were noticing this

1086
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Weird thing

1087
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
About the speed of

1088
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,367
I'm like everything else in the known world

1089
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,927
Light always moved at the same

1090
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,487
No matter how fast you moving relative

1091
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,815
And in picturing himself riding longest

1092
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Died this light

1093
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
Einstein realize

1094
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
The flight always moved at the

1095
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
The thing speed

1096
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
If light was constant

1097
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,775
Bedtime

1098
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Must be real

1099
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
Which store do you know

1100
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Eventually

1101
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
Turn our understanding of the universe

1102
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Upside down

1103
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
So you're saying that if

1104
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,439
He hadn't been alive at a time when there are well roads would create a Time problems all the while there are people writing time travel fics

1105
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,975
Ocean for the first time in history

1106
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,559
All that had been happening he might not have thought

1107
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Thoughts that he thunk

1108
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
Yeah yeah like I still think

1109
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,215
There's something about his brain that is

1110
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Explains

1111
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Part of it

1112
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
Can I buy all this other stuff

1113
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,335
The time-travel the railroads

1114
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
The stories

1115
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
I would say that that adds like

1116
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
Another

1117
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Corny bike

1118
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
So the brain is what like 20 maybe 20 as a 12 basketball let's go to 20/20 Plus

1119
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
25 Forester like

1120
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Roughly half

1121
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
I don't know

1122
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,743
I have to say that I like halfway there

1123
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,119
Precise method where do I get to see if I can push a little bit further

1124
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Okay

1125
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,959
Give another explanation bring it what are you up to

1126
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,311
I got to start small okay

1127
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
The first one

1128
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:58,687
I spoke to the sky Alberto Martinez he's a historian of science

1129
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,063
And he told me that one of the other things Einstein was reading that really blew his mind was

1130
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:10,719
Scottish philosopher David Hume who are these pretty radical ideas including that the laws of nature kind of start

1131
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,047
AirHeads that the fundamental concepts of science

1132
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Re-creation

1133
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Reinvention

1134
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
What's of the human mind

1135
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Alberto says that those ideas

1136
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,263
Evine sign permission to think his own crazy thought

1137
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,335
There's a letter from 1915 in which Einstein

1138
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,479
Write this line of thought was of great influence in my efforts very probably I wouldn't have reached

1139
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
The solution without those philosophic

1140
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Legal studies

1141
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,599
And I was gone

1142
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,183
So much so and there's a little bit of a digression that

1143
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,767
Just a couple of months before he was about to publish the theory of relativity

1144
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:50,911
Of 1905 Einstein was supposed to meet with a group of his friends to discuss him if he was writing kind of study group

1145
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,983
But one of the guys this game Lori Sullivan

1146
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
You wanted to skip a meeting of their discussion

1147
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Betty wanted to go see

1148
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Violin

1149
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
When

1150
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Einstein

1151
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
And his mathematician friend

1152
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Conrad Hobby

1153
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,271
Arrive and find that their body isn't there they are

1154
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Stop so they're still up

1155
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,183
Set that they take out their cigars and they start smoking and smoking and smoking because they know Sullivan hate smoking

1156
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,279
And then they take the ashes of every cigar and smear them

1157
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,679
On his Peapod is Piccolo his his his his his table his pillow

1158
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
Pillow

1159
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
Totally trashed

1160
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,287
Such was Einstein's love

1161
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Perfume

1162
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
I'm going to give that like a

1163
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
7

1164
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,479
Okay fine but in terms of non brain exclamations of his genius

1165
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
I'm about to give you my favorite

1166
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Alright here we go here

1167
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
So we're going to rewind a couple years

1168
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,463
Back for the apartment thrashing and working for the government employee

1169
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
In the

1170
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Swiss patent office

1171
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,839
Not a great job he's just a bureaucrat he calls himself

1172
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:58,239
Federal.inc shiter you wanted to be a physicist so badly but no one wanted to hire him again and again

1173
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
They rejected him

1174
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,847
Yet there was one person who thought he had something special

1175
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
Mileva Maric

1176
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,991
Was Serbian

1177
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:15,647
This is writer Andre and she says Malia and Einstein met in college at 8A high in Zurich

1178
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,487
Suffolk University answer one of the few places where you could

1179
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,095
Attend University as a woman believe it was actually the only women in their class

1180
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,423
They're both in the same program for preparing fish

1181
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
T-shirt

1182
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,031
Science and Math teachers they become Study Buddies and pretty soon

1183
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
She becomes his

1184
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
Girlfriend

1185
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
I longed

1186
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,199
Terribly for a letter for my beloved witch

1187
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,783
I can hardly grasp that will be separated for so much longer

1188
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
Only now do I see

1189
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Franklin

1190
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:53,535
During the early days of them as a couple or they I can I have this version of my head where it's like they were lovey-dovey but also

1191
00:53:54,303 --> 00:54:00,447
Speaking like they were on The Big Bang Theory it's like ridiculous

1192
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
I think it was I think it was both of those

1193
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,079
They go on these hikes in the Alps

1194
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Enjoy music

1195
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
Together very romantic

1196
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Relationship

1197
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,087
But it's also one that is very much

1198
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Search based on this

1199
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Sherrod love

1200
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,743
They're studying physics they're reading great works in physics that I

1201
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
He would skip class and then she would

1202
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Stained glass

1203
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
Update

1204
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,983
Oh she would take notes for him yet then they would like write these letters to each other about like these new ideas that he was reading about

1205
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
Very curious with Kleine wolf say about

1206
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
2 papers

1207
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,407
He better pull himself together and say something reasonable this is the stuff

1208
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
From which

1209
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:47,295
His work on relativity is born so she becomes the first person that

1210
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,623
You know analyzes and thinks about these things with him

1211
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
He was like the first person

1212
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:57,535
From what I can tell they like really engage with him as like this like weird off-the-beaten-path kind of guy

1213
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,607
And like support that unlike love that about him

1214
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
So they get married they have kids she leaves the science community

1215
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
He continues to your thing not very successful

1216
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
How to do it

1217
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,943
And for a long time is drains and think much better

1218
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
But then

1219
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,295
You know them these love letters I mean they really were

1220
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
A big news item

1221
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
In 1986

1222
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,439
I love letters between mileva and Einstein turned up

1223
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,303
And there's one letter and there's one line from Einstein that kind of like rocked the world

1224
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,887
There's a letter from 1901 in which Einstein says

1225
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
How proud will I be

1226
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
When we both

1227
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Together

1228
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
Bring our work

1229
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,871
On the relative motion victoriously Switzerland literally says in his power

1230
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Our work

1231
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Like our Theory

1232
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,855
And everyone's like what they could that because she helping him on the sidelines giving him reason

1233
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Cries

1234
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,975
The idea that

1235
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
This

1236
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
Iconic genius

1237
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,351
Had had a wife who maybe was his equal

1238
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:08,447
There's a couple of other letters in which Einstein again refers to our work our Theory

1239
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:14,847
When you put them all together it's enough to give anyone the impression relative motion our theory that Einstein is literally saying that

1240
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
Mileva was

1241
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
His secret coworker

1242
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
Before we get too excited about this

1243
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,647
Baby mostly me

1244
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,951
I need to throw in a few bag

1245
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
The replies that we have from her do not engage the science

1246
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
The letters in which he

1247
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
Write this to her he doesn't specify what she herself did

1248
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Alberta says

1249
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,519
When you read the letters you realize what

1250
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
He believed at the time when he wrote that letter

1251
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:50,431
Wasn't that special that relative motion idea they talked about in the letter.

1252
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
Not relative

1253
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:55,807
And something everybody knew about it at the time did Einstein have

1254
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
The theory of relativity

1255
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,647
When he's writing them and then the answer is no

1256
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,231
We have nothing and we have multiple sources and what she says

1257
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
I have nothing

1258
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,167
So she probably wasn't his co-conspirator but she did support him at this time when everybody else was

1259
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,959
Contradicting him and for that

1260
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
I think I gave her some points

1261
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,311
I'm going to be 15% based on what just cuz you just

1262
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,383
Cuz it makes you feel good to give 15 or you don't

1263
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,783
Arbitrarily I like to pick numbers out of the sky

1264
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,415
I support V

1265
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,207
Some percent for the

1266
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
Physicist UK

1267
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Before

1268
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,535
25

1269
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
Fish percent

1270
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
4 time and place 7%

1271
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
15% maleva

1272
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
Yeah that doesn't get us all the way there

1273
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
I know one other person

1274
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,615
Two stupid get like a V

1275
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Thing

1276
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,943
Cuz when I will have an answer

1277
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,807
And and I think I think there are many days bright green physicist

1278
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Better

1279
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
At Columbia

1280
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Kiss written

1281
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
So much about Einstein

1282
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,207
About Einstein in his best-selling books

1283
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,487
Talked about him

1284
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
Television specials he has a

1285
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:14,399
Play about Einstein he has written about all the ways Einstein has impacted the world

1286
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,191
And all the ways the world

1287
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Impacted

1288
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Einstein

1289
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,287
But surprisingly when we asked him about this

1290
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,639
He brought it back to the brain I have to say if I was in the shoes of the

1291
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,943
Pathologist at the time I may have

1292
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
Absconded with his

1293
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
His brain is well if it's a point is yeah there was the railroads and the time-travel fiction and

1294
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Confluence of so many different

1295
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Features

1296
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
Who sings were around for everybody

1297
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Somehow

1298
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,583
All of them came together

1299
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
In this one brain

1300
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
In a way that was different

1301
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,751
Somewhere in the collection of atoms and molecules in the brain that would cause

1302
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,871
Albert Einstein is the answer to why Albert Einstein was Albert Einstein

1303
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:01,247
What do you think there's something innate about it like Einstein was born with some special mental equipment

1304
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,319
Or you think it had more to do with his environment

1305
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,647
Princess in the end it doesn't really matter

1306
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
Because everything you experience

1307
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Lee Brice

1308
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Your biology

1309
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,535
Attaches itself

1310
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
MTO

1311
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
When you look at a brain

1312
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,399
You're not just looking at a structure

1313
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,519
You are going to Brighton in some fundamental way looking at the life

1314
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
That person live

1315
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
Yeah every

1316
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Genius

1317
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
Thought every deep

1318
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
Inside every

1319
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Pattern recognized

1320
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:36,063
Happened inside that Gloppy grade 3 or 4 lb

1321
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
Structure that's all there is

1322
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Whatever set him apart

1323
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Brian says

1324
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Is in there

1325
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Somewhere

1326
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,815
And if we had the capacity to lay out every single circuit

1327
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
And every

1328
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,143
Single influence

1329
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
That could

1330
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,567
Cascade through that brain if we were able to fully understand all the electrical signals and crackles

1331
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
That would

1332
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,759
Go through that brain yes I believe that we would fully understand Einstein's process and

1333
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,343
Understand how it was that he was able to do what he did

1334
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
I can't do that

1335
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Yet

1336
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Well

1337
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
There's a lot of

1338
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Interest

1339
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
In this concept

1340
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,351
Structure of the brain is going to tell you something about the funk

1341
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,679
That we're all just fed the poor who heard from earlier

1342
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Penitas

1343
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
People trying

1344
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,775
Nothing much with Einstein's brain anymore

1345
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,567
Bonita Thrifty's hole

1346
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
Loading area of Neuroscience

1347
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
That's where researchers are trying to

1348
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,735
Describe the brain at the level of detail Brian

1349
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:42,879
Describe is funded to the tune of 4.5 billion told us that one guy who's doing this just about a mile from where Einstein lived

1350
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
There's a

1351
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,511
Princeton University Professor Sebastian Seung and what he does he takes

1352
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,791
Cubic millimeter

1353
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,607
A cubic millimeter of mouse retina

1354
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,191
Neural tissue is not brain but it's it's neural tissue

1355
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:02,591
And he slices us into these vanishingly thin sections and then he tries to trace the axons that

1356
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:07,199
Dendrites of neurons the astrocytes the oligodendroglia etc etc

1357
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
It can take

1358
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Months

1359
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,063
It can take months to do a cubic millimeter

1360
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:21,279
And then you got to have some kind of software that can analyze

1361
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
The see if the structure can lead you to some kind of conclusion about circuitry

1362
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
My cat YouTube

1363
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:35,359
Quick why not definitely like if that doesn't get you to function then what what what would be what would be left

1364
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
I doubt if we could map

1365
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
Perfect labor

1366
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
Structure of all the connections

1367
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,575
What you're talking like me you're talking like a man

1368
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
I'm a material they call me and materials because I'm saying well the left side of the brain has something to do with the right arm

1369
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
And speech

1370
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,559
That's that's called materialism

1371
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,375
But there's another school of thought is called

1372
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,935
Somehow

1373
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Mind consciousness

1374
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,823
Spirit soul

1375
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Is

1376
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
Separate

1377
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,663
From the physical substrate of the brain

1378
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:16,063
How would that be science though cuz isn't I mean I can imagine school of thought which allows for that but but it feels like you're

1379
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
You're very quickly stepping out of science

1380
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
If you go that way

1381
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Well yes

1382
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
Yes okay

1383
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Probably

1384
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:27,839
You know we're all brought up on this thing when you read anything in the popular press

1385
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
About the brain

1386
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
They'll show you functional neuroimaging

1387
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
So when someone talks

1388
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,591
The little the Broca's area the speech area on the left side of the brain

1389
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,615
Lights up

1390
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,919
And you got well there's your answer

1391
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,759
That's the structure it lights up that's what's creating language

1392
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Except

1393
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,367
When you deal with lobsters they said when we got one problem with that

1394
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
It's called the hard problem

1395
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:56,511
If you look at that chunk of brain that you're calling Broca's area that lights up when you talk

1396
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,303
What exactly is happening there

1397
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
How does that create

1398
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
How does that create a word

1399
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,215
Or if you're looking at the occipital lobe and you're looking at the color red

1400
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,823
How do you create that Kweli at which is a fancy way of saying the sensation of color

1401
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,687
We can show you where it's happening we just can't show you how

1402
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
We're all looking the same thing we're saying

1403
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,135
Somehow if we could get a better handle on the anatomy

1404
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,927
Maybe we can explain a thought

1405
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
We can explain the song

1406
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
I mean forget forget

1407
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,607
Relativity we can explain a thought

1408
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
