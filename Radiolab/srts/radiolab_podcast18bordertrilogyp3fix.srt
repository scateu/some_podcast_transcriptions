Weight units

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
Listening to Radiolab

Will you see you got another case

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
What is

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
What are those

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Hairs

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
What's a strained muscle

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
SmartStyle closest I can

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
The closest thing I can

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Can say is that

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
The muscle dries out

37
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
So we could string and shredded

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,816
Let's go actually let's just start from the beginning okay so so we are and what what room is this

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
We're in the special procedures room

40
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Pima County Office of the medical examiner

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
And what we're looking at here is a case

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
Mostly skeletal remains do we have that we have a

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Skull

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
A few we have some

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Parts of the

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
Define it looks like and then just

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248

Tua fibula

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
We didn't we know it's the mail he's in adults

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
22:30

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
40 year old

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Migrant

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
It came in and lay

56
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
January

57
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
And

58
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Animals found in

59
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Maybe 50% of the

60
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
The skeleton is missing

61
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Is upper Limbs and his pelvis and most

62
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Spider missing

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
In his hands and feet

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
We have evidence here that a vulture

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
Speeding was feeding on the person

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
But I don't know if this is it

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
The hive beetle there globally and these hide beetle specialising in

68
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
Eating dried hard tissue still eating

69
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,424
Yeah yes he in his Colony would have been on the body

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,312
Wow in the body bag and although we try to get most of them off during our exam

71
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,896
You can see there's lots of little crevices were a single bug could

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Could be

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Wow

74
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Oh wow that's

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
So

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Yeah wow

77
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm Chad album run time Robert krulwich Radiolab and today represent the final episode of our border trilogy

78
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
Eatwith Reserve lots of Nasser and Tracy hunt and this is episode 3 which were going

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
What remains

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
Yeah okay so just to catch everyone up your lot.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
The person I was just talking to his name is Bruce

82
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Anderson

83
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,552
He's a forensic anthropologist at the Pima County Office of the medical examiner in Arizona which is where

84
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,184
When they find a body of a unidentified migrant in the Sonoran Desert

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
That's where they bring them

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
And

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Bruce

88
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Had been working there you know on and off since the 1980s but he told me that it was only nearly 2,000 that he started

89
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Seeing you know

90
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
Just more and more and more of these migrant bodies being brought in and we're just crushed by the

91
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Weights of all the dead

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
All the missing person

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Such reports

94
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
It's like working at Mass disaster when

95
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
People are still dying and plansource

96
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Crashing around you

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
And you

98
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
You throw your hands up in the air so

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Sometimes when you just think when's it going to stop

100
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
And it hasn't stopped

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,863
The number of bodies found last year was in the same range as the year before

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,263
The number of people crossing did go down after Donald Trump's inauguration but traffic is basically rebounded so

103
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,615
People are still coming through the deserts are not being tutored

104
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
Which meat is Wonder is deterrence that fundamental idea behind our current border policy

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Is it even pause

106
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
In some ways that's a policy

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Which we talked about in our last episode

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
But it's also a human

109
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,631
Is Jason still there I'm still here and that's what let us back to the person who we started this whole journey with

110
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
The Anthropologist Jason De Leon

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,799
All right can you hear lots of to pressure can good morning

112
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,407
Well I feel like maybe we should just start off where we left off

113
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Which is that you were going to tell us this

114
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
The story of

115
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
Of Maricela

116
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Sure when was this by the way

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
This has been

118
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Joel June of 2012

119
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Okay so we had been

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,047
About two weeks into the pig experiment is the series of experiments were json

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Team most students

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Looked at how

123
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Pigs decompose in the desert

124
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
In order to understand how people.

125
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
I was in the desert and it wasn't until about two weeks into this experiment where we

126
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,383
We're out hiking one day with the group of about 9

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
People

128
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Down in Southern Arizona

129
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
It's on this particular day

130
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
On this trail that I had hiked

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Many many times

132
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Student

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
And run ahead to

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
To check the fountain was taking pictures of us

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
As we're walking up a hill

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
Ethan Roberts yelling at his he says hey you got to come up here

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Something has happened

138
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
So I threw my backpack down

139
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Anatrace up this hill

140
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
And by the time I get up there right I see that that he's kind of staring at this

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
Body that's just laying face-down in the

142
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
It's on the trail

143
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Like a fully intact body

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Yeah

145
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
A woman's body

146
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
If you could tell it was a woman because she had long hair

147
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
You know she's wearing camouflage clothes

148
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Stretch pants

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Women's running shoes on

150
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
She's got a scrunchie around her wrist

151
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
But

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
The rest of it I mean her body was incredibly bloated them to the point where a little bit was about to

153
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Them to pop them all the gases that had built up

154
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Beside of her

155
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
Her body cavity

156
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,543
I didn't know what to do at this point I mean student start walking up I mean these are we young

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Students we had someone in the group who was

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
1819

159
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
For some of the students this is the first time they've seen a dead body

160
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
One of them was crying I tell everyone I said Hey look

161
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
You got to go sit down and give me a second here to figure out what

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
What is we're going to do here

163
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,463
The first he called the police we do that and then we kind of

164
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Had a conversation of God weekend

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
Photograph this person are we going to record any information is it so we still doing research right now

166
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
And Jason decided

167
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
Yeah we should

168
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
We should document

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
Uno's downgraded green discoloration

170
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,407
About what she was wearing brown to Black discoloration of arms and legs pictures of the body or fingers have started to curl

171
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Ankles are swollen to the point

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Leather sneakers

173
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Seemed ready to pop off

174
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Is a steady hissing of intestinal gases

175
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
And then it just got to the point where I was like okay

176
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
This is enough I don't want to

177
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Do this anymore

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
And so they covered her with a blanket

179
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Because

180
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Jason noticed the birds

181
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
Circling overhead for turkey vulture

182
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
And so at that point they just sort of sat down and waited

183
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
For the police to come the sheriff

184
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
An hour went by

185
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
2

186
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
3

187
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
For just waiting with the body

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Is about 5 hours in

189
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
That a sheriff and three border patrol agents show up

190
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
And they had hiked 3 miles to get to Json with a stretcher

191
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Until they bring the stretcher

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
The sheriff

193
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Puts on gloves

194
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
He ask them a few questions like did you guys put

195
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Put the blanket on there

196
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
And then they roll her into this white body bag

197
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
And as the authorities do that

198
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,239
Jason cashews Face Down json gets to see your face for the first time

199
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
And so he writes a paragraph in his book and it's

200
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,639
It's pretty gruesome but I'm going to read to you the paragraph that

201
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
He he writes about in his butt

202
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
As her body turns I see what is left of her face

203
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
It is frightening and unrecognizable as human

204
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
The mouth is an aural purple and black

205
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Cool that

206
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,815
I can't see her eyes because of mouth is too hard to look away from

207
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
The skin around the lips is stretched out of shape

208
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Has already been melted

209
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Her nose is smashed in and pushed up

210
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
She died face-down

211
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
And the Flesh on the front side of her skull

212
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Asafa

213
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
I can't order to fit around the dirt and rocks beneath her

214
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
The scene is a Pastiche of metallic gray A&P grain

215
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Whatever Beauty and Humanity that once existed in her face

216
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Has been replaced

217
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Buy Stone colored cool

218
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Stuck in the Middle screen

219
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
It's a look you can never get away from

220
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
After this thing that happened and it really

221
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:19,103
Just shook me in a lot of different ways he just couldn't shake the question

222
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Who was this woman

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
How did she end up face down in the desert

224
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
So that night I remember Jason calling me just called a friend of his

225
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
A woman named Robin Reineke

226
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,255
And being really clearly shaken and you know asking for advice

227
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,143
Robin Ashley runs this nonprofit in Tucson called the Colibri Center for human rights

228
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,983
And they do a lot of work with the missing and with bodies that have been recovered

229
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,383
So Jason tells her look we've today we had this this thing we found this person out here and could you help us ID her

230
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
Now the thing is Robin's office is actually in the medical examiner's office so that means

231
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
Just down the hall from Robin is

232
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
The guy we met at the beginning Bruce Anderson

233
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
A couple hundred people are least bones of a person are in here

234
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
Bruce is working on the medical examiner sign

235
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
Anytime and unidentified migrant body comes in Bruce tries to piece together who this person is looking at

236
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Dimensions in the shape of the skull markers

237
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
Robustness of the bones I like looking at the length of the bones or the density of the bones by the fusion of these

238
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Separate bones

239
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
Weather some bones in the body are fused together which is something that happens right after puberty

240
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,791
What age the person is there sex their weight their height and in the case of the woman that

241
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
Jason found

242
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
Her body was surprisingly in relatively good condition Tok

243
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Pretty quickly

244
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
They were able to determine you know

245
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Probably in her 30s she's five

246
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
But for

247
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
They were able to get

248
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Fingerprints from her as well

249
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,783
Meanwhile on the other side on Robin side so each of these tabs as a person

250
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Is that right

251
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
She's dealing with

252
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Hundreds of missing persons report

253
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
All day everyday she spends her days

254
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
Kitchen calls going through voicemail which is full of relatives searching I'm looking for my uncle he disappeared into

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
2010 or I'm looking for my daughter she crossed two weeks ago we haven't heard from her and she's also getting tips

256
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
From different people at different organizations

257
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Any sexy one of those calls

258
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
That leads to a break

259
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
In the case

260
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Of the body the json

261
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Okay

262
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
This is an email from me from 20

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
12

264
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,135
Hi Jason just a quick update regarding the woman that your group found

265
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
The case number is 1250

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
1867 and as of yet she's not been identified

267
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:50,143
Robin tells Jason that she got a call from an eight organization that had spoken to a guy would cross the desert

268
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Start with a big group of people

269
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,031
Around the same time and around the same area where Jason found

270
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
The body

271
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,151
He said that he recently left behind two fellow Travelers who were in serious Medical

272
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Distress

273
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
He said one of them

274
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Was an elderly man

275
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
70 years old

276
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,879
And the other was a woman maybe from Guatemala or Ecuador late thirties early forties

277
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
It isn't certain that this group is related

278
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
2 ml 12:50

279
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
67

280
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
It's highly likely

281
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
I will contact

282
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Guatemalan and Ecuadorian consulate

283
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Regarding new Miss

284
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
And eventually using all the information they got gathered Robin was able to determine that the body to Jason

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Found its the body

286
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Of a 31 year old Ecuadorian woman

287
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Name Maricela

288
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Alcapurria Marcela

289
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Zagreb Croatia

290
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,343
Robin gets in touch with Jason and tell him Jason and ask

291
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Her I would just

292
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Would appreciate if you could

293
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
You don't help me at all connect

294
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
With this family

295
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,799
That request would oddly enough

296
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Read Json to New York City that story in just a moment

297
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Hey it's made from Cincinnati Ohio Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

300
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

301
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
And I'm here because I need your help

302
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
And I request

303
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories

304
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
About what we're calling

305
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Brilliance

306
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Basically I want to hear about those times when I

307
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
Did you know did something

308
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
It just means you lean back and say wow

309
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
How do they do that

310
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

311
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Or maybe the kid was a piano

312
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,079
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

313
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

314
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
We're interested in the

315
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
Specific moments where

316
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,879
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

317
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183

Jad Robert Radiolab we are back with the third installment of our border Trilogy what remains

324
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
When we left Jason along with Robin from the clery center

325
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
Add manage to ID the body of the woman he found in the desert and so now he was trying to get in touch with her family

326
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,959
I don't know when people disappear when I die in a desert I think that the family makeup

327
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
People had been so I was hoping that if I could find this person

328
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Family

329
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
I could at least say

330
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
This is what it was like when we found her

331
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
This is what we think had happened

332
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,783
The Robin was eventually able to get Json the contact information for maricela's

333
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
Brother-in-law who will call Fernando and

334
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
I make the awkward phone call that says hey

335
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
I'm the person that found Maricela on the desert

336
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
And I would like to come and see you if that's possible

337
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
Turns out Fernando actually lives in New York City

338
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
But he had spoken to Maricela just before she left

339
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,895
And when we heard his story we decided okay we would have send a report at Ray C hunt

340
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
To talk with him

341
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,087
Yes I went to visit Fernando at his apartment in Queens

342
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Jubileeblais

343
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,207
She was there with his three dogs

344
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
Friendly guy little shorter than me neatly dressed

345
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,399
You got in a dark hair longer on top shorter on the sides and

346
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
When I got there

347
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,055
He pulled out a bunch of photos Maddy Salo

348
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
This is their marriage their wedding photos

349
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
Shoes design brother's wife

350
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
So in this picture that Fernando showing me it's his brother and Marcella they're in the church and they're posing at the all

351
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
Alter cheese in a white satin gown her hair is

352
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,471
Long and dark and shiny and she got kind of like an oval shaped face

353
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
You know she she looks beautiful but even though it's her wedding day that the thing that struck me is

354
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Is that she's not smiling

355
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Not even a little bit

356
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Is he with you like what she serious like that it is it'll actually that's part of the reason why

357
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,975
My mother said she didn't like Christmas in the beginning

358
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,071
She said you know she always has an angry face on

359
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
She looks like somebody who doesn't have a lot of friends

360
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
And on top of that

361
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
Tornado said she also had a habit of getting his brother in trouble

362
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,943
You know she'll tell my brother to sneak out of the house to go see her

363
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,551
Dancing parties La permission you know those kinds of things

364
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
But

365
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
Banana says she even sleep on the family / she help out at home

366
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
She treated my mom really well especially his mother

367
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,447
Actually I think my mother loves her more than she loved.

368
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,591
So my cell and Fernando's brother they got married they ended up having three kids

369
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Two boys and a girl

370
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,479
Mary said I had a job in a factory that made counterfeit jeans

371
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
I think Levi's

372
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,879
And Fernando's brother he would go around to different Villages selling sodas

373
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,767
They just couldn't really managed to make ends meet they were living real rough

374
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
At the time I mean going when I went to the house and saw with

375
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
So Jason after he connected with Fernando D actually ended up going down to Ecuador to meet

376
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Marsalis family

377
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
Before she had left him and they were living in a one-room

378
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Plywood

379
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Shaq with a dirt floor

380
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
And animals running running to the house and you know what she had told her

381
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Relatives recycled my kids are literally starving here yo comprendo La Casa Para

382
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Prodigy

383
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Tamia

384
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
At the time I wasn't able to help out as much financially because I was also helping build a house for my parents where they were also going to go

385
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
And so I wasn't able to support them as much or help out with things

386
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,823
Set School Minneapolis unit place on Del Escuela in so you know what she really wanted to do

387
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
You know in order to like Central

388
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,759
Schooling all that she really wanted them to have what she never had never had anything

389
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
So that was really

390
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
The pressure that you was under

391
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,439
So Fernandez in 2012 he called home

392
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,535
Are you dumb

393
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,863
One time when I come home my mom said that she wanted to talk to me

394
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,727
So I said okay on the phone and she told me that she wanted to come here

395
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
She told him that she and his brother they wanted to follow in his footsteps

396
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
That if they could come to New York like he had

397
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
They can make money send it back home and how about their kids

398
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
But that was the only way

399
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Immediately

400
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,111
Fernando was like

401
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Absolutely not

402
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
No

403
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
So

404
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Fernando told her no because

405
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,631
He didn't want her to go through the same thing he went through

406
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
10 years before

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
When he going to Sunnyvale

408
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
2001

409
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
He was 17 years old I'm about to turn 18

410
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
And his aunt was about to go to New York

411
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
And she convinced him and his parents

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,159
That if he went to New York he be able to get a job make more money and support his family from there

413
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
To have a better life to help

414
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
Things we need it

415
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
So my father thought about it and gave his permission

416
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,191
But he told me not to stay here too long and so he use his grandfather's

417
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,031
Land as collateral and took out a loan for $12,000

418
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
$12

419
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,663
Yeah I do know what the interest rate was on the loan 10%

420
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
10%

421
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Yeah

422
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,807
So one thing that a lot of people have talked about is the fact that prevention to deterrence

423
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
It professionalized the human smuggling business because not only do these migrants need be no guidance

424
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
From all these South and Central American countries

425
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
They also need guidance

426
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Do the desert

427
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
So now you have the smuggling business that's

428
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
More expensive

429
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
And also more dangerous

430
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,799
108

431
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Yessir the coyote

432
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Cold as fat 15 days maximum

433
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,735
Fernando says he and his aunt took a bus from Ecuador to Peru

434
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,599
And then from Peru they flew to Panama

435
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Got another bus

436
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
Somewhere in Costa Rica

437
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
In really mountainous

438
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
There was Ripper all that

439
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,496
This bus pulled over and the coyote he was with them at that point just said okay you have to get up here

440
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
And

441
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,848
Cookie donut

442
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
And they threw them on the ground towards the river

443
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
And they said you have to cross the river and someone will find you there and signal to that person

444
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Becoming a single media

445
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
At the very most we were left there like that

446
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
With my aunt saying

447
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
Hold on that wasn't the deal

448
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
The deal was to take us all the way to Mexico in cars but from that point

449
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,960
We started Crossing mountains on foot horrible thing started

450
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,592
From that point on they were packed into the trunks of taxis hidden in basements

451
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
Chicken coops and Hutch

452
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
Totally filled with rats in 3 months into this journey

453
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
A journey That was supposed to take just 15 days

454
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Somewhere in Mexico

455
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,952
Fernando says that he has undertaken to this run down Hacienda

456
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
This just

457
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
Sprawling Ranch House

458
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
Inside the red house

459
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
Javier Madero ciento cincuenta personas

460
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
I

461
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
There were more than 250 people there

462
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,360
From all over the world Chinese and American from every country

463
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
From all over South America

464
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,320
There's all these rooms filled with people and Fernando actually says that they were all these armed guards

465
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
All over the place

466
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Nobody was allowed to leave

467
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
And so we were

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
How to make enchiladas

469
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
And in there for about a month

470
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
And while he was there deported until Jason what happened to me there

471
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Abuse sexually

472
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:19,296
Fernando says that he was sitting outside the Hacienda when they with his aunt

473
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,928
When a group of men approached him and told him that he has to go inside with them

474
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
And he said no that he was fine sitting there you know outside

475
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
Let's be quiet

476
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Begged him not to hurt me.

477
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Please not to be with me or do anything to me and they said no don't worry is that the only one

478
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
Tascam questioned inside but that wasn't what they wanted to look you can come

479
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
With this now or you can come with us later after we beat up your aunt so finally Fernando relented

480
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
And went with them

481
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
And when they got inside Hacienda they went into a room and once we were inside

482
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
They raped me

483
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
3 *

484
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Mercedes

485
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
That's okay I'll make it

486
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
UPS Memorial maker

487
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
After that I went to

488
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
I just wanted to die

489
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
After couple of weeks

490
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,048
Fernando is on finally got out of this Hacienda and they start their Trek into the desert

491
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,680
Fernando's thinks that he went through the same desert that Monticello would try to

492
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
Cross 10 years later

493
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,288
He's actually caught by the border patrol and held for about a month

494
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Before he manages to bail himself

495
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Out of detention

496
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
And make his way to New York

497
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,528
And Fernando says he shared all of this with Maricela except his own rate

498
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
But he

499
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
Did tell her that migrants to get raped

500
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
That he seen it happen that he knows it happens

501
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
When I told her all of that she said

502
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
None of that what happened to her

503
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
She knew how to defend yourself and you know what you have to

504
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,544
She would hit people and then he told her you might have to go without food or sleep outside

505
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
Came up as an import tariff

506
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
If I said that didn't matter that all that mattered was

507
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,016
Getting here because the kids are the ones that matter X

508
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,832
Any sacrifice made is worth it for your kids

509
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
And then he

510
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
Doesn't talk to me anymore that's that's actually the last phone call they ever have

511
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,072
Because he thinks that if he cuts her off maybe she'll just give up

512
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
But she goes to one of her brothers

513
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:48,032
And her brother says that he would only pay for her to go but he's not going to pay for her husband's ago

514
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:54,176
She was going to come back herself did you try to tell your brother looks eec you shouldn't let her come here by yourself, it always

515
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
CC ligament

516
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Yeah

517
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
Yeah I called but my brother said that there wasn't another option

518
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
And that he wanted to go first

519
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
But her brother has put the condition that she goes

520
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
And

521
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,304
Because they didn't have another option she said she would go

522
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,400
Mid-2012 Maricela left Ecuador

523
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
About three weeks later right before she walked into the desert

524
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,056

And I said okay finally she can found

532
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816

00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:49,216
Unicorn kisses and they didn't know

534
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008

537
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Pictures of really

538
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Difficult

539
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Wondering

540
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
If I'm going to do more damage than then goodbye by

541
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Going to meet these folks

542
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
8 months after marcela's death Jason came to New York to meet Fernando and he brought with him

543
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
The pictures of Marcella's body that he took when he

544
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
When you found her in the desert

545
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
Yeah he was like this right now show me the photos and I was

546
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Just dancing around that for

547
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Over an hour

548
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Decongestant katana

549
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
Fotos de Maria Fuentes

550
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Jason Warren that the photos were

551
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Really upsetting

552
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
They were so many like that

553
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,368
But I said that it's okay to show them to me and I'll give him the book of photos that I printed

554
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,952
Innocent pictures of the shrine that we built for her

555
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,816
I'm in the desert it's got pictures of my students who were there and then eventually

556
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
It's just pictures of like the back of her head so it's her hair

557
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
It's some of the clothing

558
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
It's her it's her hand

559
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
It's all the photos in the truth is that

560
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
22 pieces to see your

561
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,712
Imagine everything she had to endure in the desert

562
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
She tried to keep going

563
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Dragging herself

564
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
Jason brought me photos of

565
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
How she was found in

566
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Body

567
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Abstract

568
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Trying to keep going

569
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
Before maricelis body was sent back to Ecuador

570
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
Fernanda decided they should have it sent to New York first

571
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,160
Don't sass

572
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
When I talk to my family I said you know

573
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Her dream was really to arrive here

574
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
And so I thought

575
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,888
At least we can fulfill that dream with her body

576
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
To be able to have

577
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
To have a wake for her here

578
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
They held a wake at a Funeral Home in Queens

579
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,272
Almost a hundred family members and friends came to celebrate maricela's life

580
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
They were told to keep the coffin shut

581
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,928
The next day her body went back to Ecuador

582
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,024
Fernando tatis stay in New York because he knows

583
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
If he were to go back to Ecuador

584
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,400
It would just be way too hard to try to come back to the United States

585
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
He says that you know right now he's just

586
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Trying to

587
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Philip Ramos

588
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
Promise that I made to maricela's body when it arrived here

589
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
I was going to look after the children

590
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
I was going to try to give them

591
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
What she had wanted for them

592
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,488
When you think about that conversation do you think that there's anything you could have said that would have made her

593
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,632
Hold her what could happen along the way.

594
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
Camino

595
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
I thought that would be a way of

596
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Trigger

597
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Gay

598
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
And it's worth

599
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Cleaning out

600
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
You know I mean more generally

601
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,912
Prevention through deterrence as a as a strategy

602
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
Hasn't deterred people from coming to the US either

603
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
The annual budget for the border patrol is roughly 3.5 billion dollars bigger than it was

604
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
In 1990

605
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
We have

606
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,296
About five times as many border patrol agents

607
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
And get the number of

608
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,416
Pupil immigrants living here undocumented

609
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Has more than tripled during

610
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
From 3 and 1/2 million to

611
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
About 11 million

612
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
And more people are coming

613
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
Every year every day

614
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
And more people are dying along the way

615
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Yeah what's it doing here

616
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,576
About a year after Marcella died Jason got a call from her family

617
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Do you want some

618
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Maverick Iceman

619
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
The name of drones

620
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Tucker

621
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
Another family member had

622
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
Appeared in

623
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Pretty much

624
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
The same place Marisela.

625
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Which is this

626
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
Text Maverick Maverick I'm going back to the to the Arizona desert basically because

627
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Marisela has a

628
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
The cousin

629
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
Who 13 year old cousin named Jose Tech hoodie

630
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Who disappeared

631
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
Almost one year to the day that she died

632
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:04,608
I was able to kind of triangulate based on interviews with people who he was with and with information from

633
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
Cranberries folks

634
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Where we think he went missing

635
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
And I told his mom that I would not stop looking in

636
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
It took me a couple years to figure out a weighted to

637
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
To do that

638
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
But right now

639
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
It will go back and will you see Toronto

640
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
And see what we can come up with

641
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
And you know

642
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,072
Better than anyone what happens to bodies in the desert now I think

643
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
I mean

644
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
Why are you still looking for him

645
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
White piano

646
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Yeah but that's calluses that question sounds I guess

647
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Give me part of it I just don't know what else

648
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
To do if you feel so

649
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Hopeless

650
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
I told his mom

651
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:55,040
Like I won't I won't stop looking for him I'll do whatever I can whatever little thing that I can do

652
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
And if I can't find him

653
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Well maybe I'll find somebody else

654
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Me now so we will

655
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
