Okay so the

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
The other day I bet by what we say we are

00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
Okay so the other day storing called listen to the studio

8
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
Hahaha

9
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
And there was a giant

10
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,512
Human sized rodent sitting in the engineering seat very large rodent was Richard Millard West

11
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,144
Cuz it was a puppet head that we had toured with who is that under that big straighting elastic

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
Maybe you guys should go

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Oh my goodness

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Is it

15
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Is this Alan

16
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Oh my God oh my God

17
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Price of the story is the recent storm God

18
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,744
I want to surprise us is it somewhere around now is the 15-year

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
Crazy to say 15 year anniversary of making radio

20
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
15 years I know we have some tape for you guys

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,128
Seems like you got to have someone around who knew you when you know okay

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,736
So we settled in we didn't really know what's going on and then horn did something truly evil

23
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
She's somehow I don't know how probably are could have helped.

24
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
Her hands on the very

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
First

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
1

27
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
No

28
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
This is my nightmare

29
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,864
The very very very had hoped these tapes and that would never surface but she found him

30
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960
They're on BitTorrent for a second I thought they had disappeared

31
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
So happy but then

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,224
2002 very first one

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
God don't start

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Please make the CD crash right now

35
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Every radio producer

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
Has this idealized image in their head

37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
If you out

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Maybe you're sitting on the couch

39
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Drinking coffee

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Staring out the window

41
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Maybe you're the person who's driving

42
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Pullover

43
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
To really concentrate on a story

44
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Whatever the case that image

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Radio producers brain

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
You

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
The Listener

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Why they make

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
The only thing

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
We don't get paid much

51
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
You look around these heavy recorders in Mike's

52
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
New look

53
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Thank you silly

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
In those headphones I have to wear if it doesn't matter

55
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
As long as you are there

56
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Listen to what they make

57
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
WNYC is about to embark on Annex

58
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,008
We're calling it The Radiolab

59
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,592
Great documentary radio stories of different sizes

60
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Shapes

61
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Colors

62
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
Different places all over the planet from different times even

63
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
Mix it all together

64
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Like this

65
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Big group of people and places

66
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
But it'll take 2 hours and 59 minutes to go

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
Puyallup 2 hours and 15 minutes

68
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,984
2 hours 3 hours he was it 3 hours show every week

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,592
Every freaking week every week 8 to 11 every Sunday night

70
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Huge

71
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
A huge hunk of airtime where no one was list

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm right here

73
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
I'll be your

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Curator

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Guide Maybe

76
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
How about DJ Ave.

77
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
Oh really

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
That's terrible it doesn't work at all

79
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
Every moment every moment

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,823
Explain like the show is just super different back then

81
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,199
The idea of it back then was to just take all of these documentaries from around the world and smash them together

82
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
But would end up happening is it like I would line up three or four things

83
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
And I would have liked a 20-minute hole

84
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
Which I would start to experiment and that's

85
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
Those spots were what the show grew out

86
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
What's up so that was in 2002 and then I met you the following spraying

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
And then we are later the whole year later

88
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
I know there's a year worth of that

89
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
And by the time I met you back

90
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
In New York

91
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
You were so sleep-deprived okay so we're a little bit and then we start talking

92
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
At the moment

93
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
When Robert got involved with someone I'll never

94
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
So I was trying to fill one of those 20-minute holes I had done an interview with a memory research

95
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Picture

96
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
And it was just one of those

97
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,607
Science interviews. Now we're super familiar with we're like the scientist is using all this latinate words

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
I couldn't figure out what she was saying but it's

99
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Still seemed interesting

100
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
I just couldn't understand it and so Robert and Ellen and I had breakfast one day at kitchenette

101
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Foundation rest

102
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
We go to for breakfast every week and we were sitting there and

103
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,527
I was like I got this interview I don't know what to do with about memory and I

104
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
Here's what I think she's saying I think she's saying something about how memories are never the same you're always constantly making them and then you just like

105
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Snapped into this

106
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Stingray

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,071
Suddenly you're playing this like all these characters

108
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
Al and I were like oh my god let's just go into the studio and have him do that you want to hear a little

109
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Taste of the sort of curious what would this is this is one of the ones like we did the memory and forgetting at the podcast

110
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
But this is

111
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
Free this is before that is over

112
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Earlier doesn't 3 I think

113
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Your list

114
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
2 radio

00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
And I was looking at the picture today

126
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Now you wearing

Looks really really

132
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Cold

133
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
Look at this photo

134
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
How much pitcher in the history of

135
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Anyone who's ever been born as Citadel

136
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Thousand times

00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
I couldn't help but be wowed I mean look what they did

138
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
They got their crazy box

139
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Into the air

00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Couple hundred

141
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Feed whatever

144
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Slime

147
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
$200

148
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
We're going to talk about that

149
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
And the real question is

150
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
How is it we can do all that

151
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
And still not understand some very basic things like

152
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
Common cold that's the example of how is given

153
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
What about memory

154
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
What up memory

155
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
House of David Feherty

156
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,903
He was a pogo stick I'm going to jump on it 50 times

157
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
What about tissues

158
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,047
Let's random way to get it

159
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,143
Play eventually talk about Kitty Hawk or was that just already know

160
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
But let's let go a little bit further for this week

161
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Creative

162
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
Describe axon begins with a reading from theater director and actor Simon McBurney

163
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
You have to literally remake it

164
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Every time every memory

165
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Did you remember

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Is differ

167
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
Because it is remade in the very present that you remember

168
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Another words

169
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
In order to remember

170
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
You need

171
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
The imagination

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
Simon McBurney performing a monologue from his play pneumonic

173
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
Are the show Studio 360

174
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
And with me in the studio to explore these ideas a little further

175
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Is mr. Robert krulwich from ABC News

176
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Robert

177
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,967
You've reported on this right yeah I never actually met Simon

178
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
McBurney but that's

179
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
Remember something

180
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,439
You need an active imagination is understating it really

181
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Staging a house

182
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Let's just take the situation we're in right now

183
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
Okay I'm sitting here in front of you or about what

184
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
3 feet apart or something like that

185
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
So when you look at me right now

186
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
It takes actually the light that's bouncing left my face a tiny bit of

187
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Time to reach your retina

188
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
But by the way I arrived upside down and have your brain write me

189
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,135
A little bit of time for the sound of me this sound right now you think

190
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,535
December to travel at 750 miles an hour from edu okay arrested in that ear that you have

191
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,863
That's a travel through those hairs that you got in your ear

192
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
That's a turn into electricity and have to go to the

193
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
Placing your brain where sound is lie

194
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:52,127
I'm in touch with me if I would have touch you right now have to travel electrically to your brain that would take a little time

195
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,479
God the smell of suppose I put some licorice in my mouth

196
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,295
The smell of the licorice come out of my mouth

197
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
That you would have to

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,415
Travel all the way to your nose keep your nose into the place where smells like

199
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
I'm in your brain has to take all these parts

200
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
And pull them together into this thing that you think is going on right now

201
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Please let me get this straight

202
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
You're saying that

203
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
At this moment

204
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Yes and this one

205
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Antoine

206
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
I hopelessly lost

207
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,967
Some people say that you don't have to live in the moment this is the moment

208
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
Fort

209
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
It's a memory

210
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Everything

211
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Isn't it

212
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Wow

213
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
So what's everyone up under this

214
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Mommy

215
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
This one

216
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
You say it has already happened before it even had a chance to become this moment but let's say we want to remember it later

217
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
What do we do it's interesting what's going to happen

218
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Is you're going to

219
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Take

220
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,943
The touch the sound of smelling everything that's in your brain from that moment with you all sitting lodged in different places

221
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
You going to reassemble it pull it back

222
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Together again I use the interesting thing

223
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
20 minutes from now

224
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Really hungry

225
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
Dim the licorice number the liquid part of the licorice part will somehow Loom a little larger be

226
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Because you want

227
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Itachi susanoo

228
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,239
How you're feeling in the moment that you're remembering has a lot to do with what you remember

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Let's just take a simpler phrase like

230
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch

231
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Kapiel of water right

232
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
If you want to recollect that

233
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Praise

234
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
But suppose you just had a wonderful

235
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Sting

236
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Jill when you think of when you reassemble it

237
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
It'll go

238
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,327
Jack and Jill went up the hill

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
Season see the Jill thing is so

240
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
That instead you just confirm extraordinary Haiku you have

241
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Gloriously, spectacular Hill

242
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Can I hear the thing when you reassemble this time

243
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
You think

244
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Jack and Jill

245
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
What up

246
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
See the hell now the healing this has got all the MPN I got it so you're always remembering

247
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
Differently each time depending upon this reminds me of

248
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
We have any player this

249
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
It's amazing to me that at such an early point

250
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
The business of

251
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
Deconstructing puzzles

252
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Switch I guess a lot of what we did

253
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Took on this very big

254
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Particular quality

255
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
This kind of

256
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,927
Razzle Dazzle Of Anything could happen in the next second I don't know who's going to say the next thing

257
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
But there's something beautifully organic about it when it's done

258
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
So today we're celebrating 15 years

259
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,263
Of making Radiolab coming up after the break we're going to play the first thing they were podcast

260
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
It's not something you can get on iTunes

261
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
It fell off iTunes a long time ago

262
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Play the first

263
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
This is Lisa Kenny calling from San Diego

264
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,063
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

265
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
Enhancing public understanding of science

266
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,511
And technology in the modern world more information about Sloan at www.slha.org

267
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,263
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

269
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

270
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

271
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Brilliance

272
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,367
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

273
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
It just means you bring back and say whoa

274
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,351
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

275
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

276
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,007
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

277
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,871
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

278
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
We're interested in the

279
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Specific moments where

280
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,807
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

281
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
If you have a story with us

282
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:23,231
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio mess

283
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

284
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Thank you so much

285
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Ava back

286
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
So

287
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,807
The first episode we were podcast literally the first but it was among the first few

288
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
With an episode about time

289
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
I do remember

290
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Playing it to my wife

291
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,023
I was always scared cuz she's a New York Times Reporter I thought I was to learn to like the company

292
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
And she came out of the kitchen in

293
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
I really like

294
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
Call me if you feel like it

295
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
Is one of the one of the early military like maybe this

296
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,687
Are podcast

297
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
80 years ago

298
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Probably very few people have heard this

299
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
You're listening to radio on New York Public Radio public radio WNYC

300
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,407
You know this music trust me

301
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
You heard it your entire life

302
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
The reason you can't recognize it now

303
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
Because the composer born 1770 intended for this moment the one you're hearing

304
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
The last two seconds

305
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Like that

306
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
However have you been a whale

307
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
Beethoven might have written his Ninth Symphony this way

308
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Changes that for us would take

309
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
An instant

310
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Transpire over minutes and a movement

311
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Eyeglass

312
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
6 hours

313
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
That's a fact what this is

314
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,095
Beethoven's 9th Symphony digitally stretched from its normal 60 some-odd Minutes to last an entire

315
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Day 24 hours

316
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,823
And if you sit for the entire 24-hour duration of the peace as people do from time to time

317
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,663
You realize that this music is not simply slower

318
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
The slowness unlocked something in the original

319
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Maybe was there all along we couldn't hear it

320
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
Play with the meter music is mostly about me or after all

321
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
Music has a different story to tell a secret

322
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
Locked up inside the routine change the routine

323
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Making discoveries

324
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
That's what we'll do this hour

325
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
We'll look at time so closely will discover new things about it

326
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
Listen to Radiolab on Jad abumrad my guests tonight for the next hour to help me wrestle with time is the science

327
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Robert krulwich

328
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,695
ABC News Nova and Nightline how are you sir

329
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:40,095
I'm very well I like this bathing in Beethoven thing you got going on right now

330
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
Dropping in on a performance that happened recently in San Francisco

331
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
Where people listen to it

332
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
The course of an entire day Woodbury

333
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
A day

334
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
So we're first

335
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
Let's begin with the guy who I

336
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,455
I think you'll find that he thinks very deeply about time in fact

337
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
In a very gentle kind of way you could say he's

338
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Time obsessed

339
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
You heard of the neurologist Oliver Sacks

340
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
The man who mistook his wife for a hat

341
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
All right

342
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
So I was over

343
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
How's this is me

344
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Actually over at

345
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Jackie Chan

346
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
I don't know where this is rather than I have not experienced

347
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
Some years ago in action 1993

348
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
When I got a

349
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
A message for my

350
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Publisher

351
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Very sad that off

352
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
For that 21st birthday

353
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
They that Jubilee

354
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Asking if we would like to select

355
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
The previous 21 years and white

356
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
When I got this message

357
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
I thought for why don't I choose 90

358
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Can 72

359
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
The first of the

360
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Witches

361
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Very Vivid and important

362
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Xiaomi

363
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Auntie

364
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
Was he good witch my mother died

365
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Pocket whistle

366
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
In which height

367
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Completed Awakening

368
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
And these two events

369
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
In some way

370
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
I was actually

371
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
In the car when I

372
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Tautphaus

373
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
I picked it up and I

374
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
MacArthur and I was driving

375
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Map to Canada

376
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
And I had to take the

377
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
What are with me so I

378
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
I spoke 1972 allow

379
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
And by that time

380
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,655
I thought. Why don't I do 1973 as well

381
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
By the time I did you get the Montreal or used

382
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Hope you took about

383
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
How about how

384
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Half an hour

385
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
By the time I got to the Canadian border

386
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
I was up to 1987

387
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Anthem

388
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
I didn't pack make an extra Loop

389
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
So that I could compete Fitness

390
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
However it turned out

391
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Venti

392
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,839
The most recent to us in the late eighties in the 90

393
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
I did not

394
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
What county have such

395
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
PeaceHealth

396
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Memories

397
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
And they seem subjectively shorter

398
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Sometime I guess we all know this

399
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Is a very

400
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
Plastic thing

401
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
And it's like

402
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Glasses and other times

403
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
But because Oliver is so inquisitive

404
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
Investigator Hartman

405
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
He's looked

406
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Inside

407
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm beginning when he was

408
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
10 11 12

409
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
He wanted to get inside

410
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Time

411
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
I had to I had to

412
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Lots of boyish interests

413
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,679
And these pre-adolescent Pinterest

414
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
So they won't suck a bee sting when I became an adolescent

415
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,079
But one of them was chemical chemistry about

416
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
One of them was photography and I had

417
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Dog, cameras

418
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
I'm one of the most plants

419
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
And in particular

420
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
My mother was faithful to her arms and the God was full of

421
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
I love the way in which the

422
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
The Kill.

423
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
Fiddleheads on cruises of films

424
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Would answer

425
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
And it was almost as if time was with her

426
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Rolled up inside Amazon

427
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Time itself

428
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Unfold

429
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
Connect PC to stay with pets

430
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Take a a day or two

431
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
To do this

432
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
And I wanted to see it

433
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
It made me think of these Christmas things when they're blowing

434
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Lisa

435
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
Paper trumpets

436
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Because I'm sold

437
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
And so

438
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
I set up my camera

439
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
On a tripod

440
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
And at least in the daytime

441
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
Take pictures at night I didn't have a flash then

442
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
I took a series of

443
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
Pictures every hour or so

444
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
Off the phone

445
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
And then showed these rapidly

446
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Putting them together in a

447
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
And this way then

448
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
What

449
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,544
Took a day or two or several hours to happen

450
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
What's compressed into several seconds

451
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
So the compression of time

452
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Social classes

453
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Fascinated me

454
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,064
If Oliver sex can make a baby Fern unfurl

455
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
How about this

456
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
Radio producer Tony Schwartz

457
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Can do the same thing

458
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
With his baby niece

459
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
What Inception sound

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,816
Here sped up for your appreciation is Nancy Schwartz

Birthday age 12 in 2 minutes 12 seconds exact

462

Jack and Jill went up the hill

463
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,768
To fetch a pail of

464
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Jack fell down and broke

465
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
Jill came tumbling

466
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008

467
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,616

How do you say I want a puppy and a whistle

470
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
Ocwen

Ella hat

472
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Address

473
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
The ballerina cast

474
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,928
That's why it got that way

475
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Santa Claus can't bring his

476
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
You can cry

477
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Tony Exum

478
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Lillian house

479
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
If you have to make him housebroken

480
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,824
If you mix Valerian in the apartment

481
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,872
Cat describing with a newspaper

Kick-Ass boat

484
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
What do you think of the Russian sending the dog up in the satellite

485
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Well

486
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
I Hope You Dance

487
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Get hurt

488
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
But if he does I'm sure they'll send up America

489
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,792
School I had to do a report on some place

490
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,376
And I'm doing a report on Hawaii

491
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
Android and we're taking notes and doing research

492
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
December we're going camping in a

493
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312

High top

498
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
That's why I like it

00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
I'm taking guitar lesson

School that's great

503
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
And I've been working on the school newspaper I might be a distraction

504
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Next year

505
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
And

506
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,520
I've been discovering boys

507
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,064
You know what that is what's up what you just heard

508
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
The parent clock

509
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
Apparent

510
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,464
That's kind of cool cuz the kid gets older

511
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
You can't

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,632
Deny the fact that you must be getting older too when your son has hair on his legs

513
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
But this is true this is how the whole world works

514
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
It's a it's a everything is a clock I guess

515
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
By the way that was Nancy Grows Up in the audio flipbook recorded and arranged by the great radio producer Tony Schwartz

To talk about

520
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
My question

521
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
If we got an example of what you just called

522
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Parent clock

523
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,960
You got other kinds of time you don't like like personal time getting out of bed time

524
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
Existence really time was measured by its lunch time it's wake up time

525
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
Rye trying to Milk The Cow time

526

2 clock

529
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
That's interesting

530
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Let's go back

531
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,768
To the 1800's imagine a guy will call him old is Old Town AAA

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,632

533
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
What time it is

534
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Okay so

00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:50,080
Walking to say big B's Tavern

00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
Of course it's right however

538
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,000
Instead of going into the tavern Hannigan at the exact same moment

539
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Deutsche bank building

540
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560

3 minutes

542
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Is it right though

543
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,312
Yes it's right at that very same moment suppose instead of going to the top of the bank

544
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
He gone to the hotel

00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,096
In Sandusky at the question the answer is

551
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,400
There was no official time in sendai

552
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,496
What do you mean there's no official time and said there wasn't any known 1850

553
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
The government didn't have a Time

554
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
Celina Ohio in the 1850s you'd have as many times

555
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
As it were clocks in the town

556
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
So there was no reason

557
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:06,112
You think about it to synchronize it if you're clocking like what 4 minutes or 10 minutes different in Sandusky and 1850s

558
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Who cares

559
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Until

560
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
The railroad changed every

561
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,840
Once the Wheel Road King is open while to take

562
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
I don't know

563
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,656
How about the 303 to

564
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Okay

565
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
If you want to take the field. How would he know when it was 303 I see where you're going with that if you went by the Banks

566
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Need a ride

567
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
A half hour ahead of time

568
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Can you buy the hotel clock

569
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Chalk for the sake of their business really real roads created railroad time and again putting up clocks are there

570
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,888
Makes sense and because the railroads were so important

571
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
The Tavern we have to get its beer deliveries from where

572
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,848
The banks would have to get their cash from the railroad in the hotel

573
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,408
Real-time becomes everybody

574
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
So what happened to local

575
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Will local time disappeared

576
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,208
Really yeah it local time means that when it's noon in Sandusky the sun is directly over your head

577
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
By 1880

578
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
That wasn't true anymore

579
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
The real Road

580
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
Head instructed Sandusky that from now on

581
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
It's noon would be 20 minutes later

582
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
So they could fit into the railroad schedule noon over 20 minutes

583
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
I put it to you

584
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,464
Sonos series that people fought against the Rebellion are the railroad

585
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
Oh there were time Wars and certain towns were part of the town would go to Railroad time but the other part would deter

586
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,960
Permanently stick with what used to be local time at different times in the town

587
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,824
Wow it's almost like as a personal freedom time in a way represents

588
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Your own identity

589
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
And they would you want to give up their identity

590
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
Money man Sandusky I meant every other Town eventually conform to Railroad time and that is how time became

591
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Standardized

592
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
I'm became Zone

593
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Time to Kill

594
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
Clock reference

595
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
You ask somebody what time is it they don't say you know it's bedtime or just lunch

596
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
I mean look up with this

597
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
A look at the clock and the railroad today

598
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:35,360
Moana lost every 60 Minutes every 12 hours

599
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,480
Download lots of Pi

600
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
There's an interesting connection to explore here

601
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
And it has to do with horses

602
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Horses

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
Dimension railroad companies it just so happens that the owner of the biggest railroad company Leland Stanford

604
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
I don't think

605
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
Who's really into speed

606
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Any old really fast horse

607
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
The horse's name is oxygen

608
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Accident

609
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
I know I know

610
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Story goes this horse

611
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
Subject of a gentleman's bet

612
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
It's it's a myth

613
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
Stanford so far as we know it was not a betting man that's Rebecca solnit she would know she wrote a book about this called River of shadow

614
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
The focus of her book

615
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
If the solver of the back

616
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
It was an argument

617
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
There's no evidence that there was money on it

618
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,216
Mini cases argument on Stamford news Railroad by sending around the following question

619
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,056
When a horse gallops do all four of its feet leave the ground and wants to be thinking

620
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
I don't know it's not a question I'm afraid we ever ask anyone but at the time it was a big question cuz they had no way of knowing

621
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:49,600
Smooth faster than eyeballs conceit to Leland Stanford wanted to prove it a horse at all four feet off the ground at one time

622
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,416
And he was recommended to Troy Bridge

623
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,000
As a photographer to capture this along comes eadweard muybridge

624
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,840
She can take a picture of the horse at exactly the right instant

625
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,704
See whether I'll for fever off the ground and saw the bet. The problem

626
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
Cameras in those days were very

627
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
Slow or fast exposure would be maybe a second or several seconds was going to push for

628
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,040
Photography to suddenly be able to capture Motion in a 500 of a second otherwise you just got blur

629
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,112
Black

630
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
Imagine that first step out of the world of the blur

631
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
When Richard stretch the wire across the racetrack

632
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:36,960
Attached it to the shutter mechanism on its camera oxygen the horse gallops by

633
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
Trip The Wire

634
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Freezes the horse

635
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Mid gallop

636
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,968
Steals him right out of the flow of time

637
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
Doesn't just take one photo he takes

638
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
24

639
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:59,232
See Place 24 cameras in a line one after the other with 24 tripwires stretching across the racetrack

640
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
Worship everyone

641
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:09,472
24 Frozen unblurry

642
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
Horses so what it what are they seeing

643
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,616
All the pictures from the series of a horse running in some of those photos

644
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
Show dachshund yes with all four feet off the ground

645
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
So the camera here

646
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Unlock

647
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,832
A secret is it lets us see something you could never see before because this camera

648
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Essentially stops

649
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Exactly

650
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
Meanwhile says Rebecca mortgage

651
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,232
Became fascinated with learning more secrets of time

652
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,632
Secrets locked inside basic human movements a splash

653
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Walk of pirouette

654
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,128
Boy fidget photographs Rushing Water he was obsessed with water and his landscape pictures

655
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,784
So obsessively has people pour water splash water pour water over themselves poor pictures of water

656
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
Pour water into glasses

657
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
Splash water out of basins

658
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Bathing water

659
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,488
And you can see all these droplets Frozen in mid-air

660
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
This one particular photo Robert work

661
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
You see a sheet of water

662
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Spend it in the air

663
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
Hovering over the splash

664
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
Metallica ghost

665
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,712
Take all those frozen moments in line and one after the other and play them back and you've got

666
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Flow again

667
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,296
Albeit artificial flow

668
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
Recall movies

669
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,416
Movies

670
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:39,072
But the next time you're feeling stressed out you said yourself I'm stressed I need to go to a movie to relax

671
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
You should know

672
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
The technology that made the movies is exactly the same which sped up the pace of Modern Life with stress you out which led you to go to

673
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,432
When the first wave movies were used with the film Factory workers doing repetitive tasks

674
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
Find out how to make this task more efficient

675
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
Maybe too slowly is this the right way

676
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
Dumb and slow them down and then use that to teach

677
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Everyone else

678
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,792
And then when World War II came

679
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,168
This was not just now in the cause of efficiency this was a life-or-death matter cuz this is how you beat Nazi

680
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,824
All the scientific devices of chronology a machine Manufacturing

681
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
Time and all hands must be

682
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,136
There's a whole nother way to think about

683
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
Time can be a weapon in

684
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
4

685
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
It can be

686
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
The most

687
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
And natural

688
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Thing in the world I learned about this from a book by Jay Griffiths

689
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
Called sideways

690
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Let me just

691
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Bottega stop here at the clock

692
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
Even though you don't like

693
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,128
But there's too many cool Cox in your box

694
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
There's a spice

695
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
Yes

696
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,488
Sucks that you can see when it's really dark and if you can see that he just waking up at 2:35 and you really didn't want to wake up

697
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
Sprinkles for a long time

698
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,448
In the night you don't have a way of seeing what time is inside somebody invented

699
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Spice Coke so you can

700
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Castaway

701
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Tonight's

702
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
So that would be maybe kind of

703
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Cinnamon for about 1

704
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Contemporary fit

705
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
Figured you sitting there in bed

706
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
And you stiff the time

707
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:37,856
Tweaked Isis

The clock of birds this is the political

709
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,912
Assassin bugs like the you can fly but in the hooded butch but

710
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
When they sing in the morning

711
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
The children

712
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Totally understand that.

713
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Gallatin Valley View dinner because of the house

714
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,064
When they said sing that lace afternoon pools

715
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
That's a signal for children

716
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,696
Go back home

717
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,280
DeForest in central Highlands in Papua New Guinea

718
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
Is the auction that is very sorry

719
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,448
Difficult place to be in won't start and it said children would need to know

720
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
At what time to start heading for him

721
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,944
Now how about it 1751

722
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
And Carl Linnaeus famous

723
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,904
Catalog categorizer of everything that you can see

724
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
You can see by the blooming of differ

725
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
Flowers what time it was

726
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,096
Some kind of something that blooms in the morning and then folds up like a morning glory

727
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,192
Would be there in the morning and then in the evening an evening primrose

728
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
Yes you're all plants that open for an hour or two and then close

729
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
So you're walking by

730
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
And you see a blush of what's a pink then you know it must be the morning or just a blush or probably must be lunch time or whatever

731
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,552
Yes exactly exactly

732
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
Very good Garden

733
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,160
Be able to do that yes isn't it isn't it unconnected

734
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Andaman forest in the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean

735
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,328
People have a scent calendar

736
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,472
Which I find most beautiful I did because some what it was is a way of kind of describing the months

737
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,544
By the sense of certain fruits and flowers

738
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,944
Timer

739
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
What time is everywhere in nights at what I wouldn't want to things I want to do with the whole book was to say you know we think of time things to do

740
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
In fact for most of the world's most of History

741
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,792
Time has been absolutely embedded in nature and some beautiful eyes

742
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Thanks Robert will be back in a moment

743
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
You're listening to Radiolab on New York Public Radio

744
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
So that was a butt chug

745
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,560
Of the first thing we ever podcast was a show about time

746
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
And

747
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
It's in honor of our 50th birthday

748
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
Because there's a itsfunneh Robert like there's

749
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
We just looked at the radar RSS

750
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
WeChat

751
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,456
It's a I don't know what it stands for it it's the thing that like feet iTunes

752
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
When you go on iTunes and you see all the episodes

753
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Suzhou to see

754
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
What was there

755
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,184
And other some limit that's that iTunes places in the number of items that you can have in the feed

756
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,792
And they're like a hundred fifty or something and we realize like

757
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,864
150 early episodes have fallen off

758
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,240
The feed a really yeah that way we were a backless like at random house that would be like Hemingway and fit

759
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,056
Fitzgerald have fallen under the floors exactly select

760
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
Huge number of old episodes of falling off

761
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:17,504
And I start looking at that list and on that list or some episodes that are weirdly relevant now

762
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
A whole bunch that are just completely not relevant

763
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
And I was like I think

764
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
I want to pull some of those back into the flow

765
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
Because it'll give us a chance to like sort of just

766
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,864
Reframe them and Rick think about them and update them and sometimes

767
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,264
Science gets old and needs to be updated but sometimes gets refreshed by something is happening in the real way

768
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
World's yeah

769
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,896
So what the plan would be is Maybe

770
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
You know in the coming months we would go

771
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
We back for us

772
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Just like 1413

773
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
1512 years back

774
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,416
And resurrect things and throw them out and see who wants to take a smack at them now

775
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
And what it is things have changed

776
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
Yeah it was more interesting

777
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
Early wrong now

778
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,424
In a fascinating way

779
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Advantage of getting all of this

780
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
You can ask

781
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
You can play with your memories

782
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Exactly

783
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
And not be a rabbit

784
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
There you go

785
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
All right well that was

786
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,624
That was something

787
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Yeah we'll be normal

788
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,800
