00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
DuckTales

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,496
This all started

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Because

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
I could not

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Convince

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
Any of my friends

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
To go to the elevator history me

00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Museum with me

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
There was not a single person out of the eight and a half million people living in New York who wanted to

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
To go to the bottom

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
But you found one except around recall

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
I'll go to anything

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
Jamie told me

Never to stop recording

26
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
So we go to Long Island City

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
Is entirely tax

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,128
See yellow only thing we saw was a big old boring building covered with

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
With with taxis

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
We have no interest in

31
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,552
We found some guy on the street yes there is

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,136
You got to go up the stairs

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
I'll take you there anyway all right

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Ragnarok

00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,776
Haha wow that's quite a son elevator Museum founded 2011

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
So we open up the door

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
I have no idea what could be

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Hello

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
This is different from what

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,880
Large room where only are you building up to something

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
It's filled with

43
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
What is it

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
What stop elevator match

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
Pens or witches and warlocks

46
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Random

47
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Stop is the things you get with sales

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
Yeah the Rosenberg lubricant

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
Small brass objects of one kind or another giant painting of escalators and moving

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Sidewalk

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
And sitting in a corner

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Hi I'm lucky

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Across the room

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
We see a guy

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Sitting is it an older guy got your car

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
He has his glasses

57
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
Is down on his nose and he's in charge of

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,536
Play something call me if they want to come visit 718-361-8683 apparently you're supposed to make

59
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
And if I'm in the movies I'll get a saw

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
Patrick is being the lead singer in the number of bands and he even studied cons

61
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
This is a man for all seasons

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
He's got so much elevators

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,920
Stop asking questions of living years old because when you were seven years old you walk into an elevator and had a

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
Emil nier

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
I went to college got a couple degrees

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Stay in the elevator

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Never left

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
I actually my first

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Item is over I want the walls here

70
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Let me show you something

71
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Announce we're walking along a button

72
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
We come inevitably

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
You do a series of elevator button panel

74
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,008
Here's a golden up-and-down here's a bronze up and down

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
He has all kinds of ants

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,896
Speak buttons that I mean from a different era songs one where you go

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
Inches into feet

78
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
So this

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Is the Genesis

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,392
The insults begins and it is an insult because what is about to happen

81
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Cuz he's about to tell us that we are

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
Googles and have no power in the world in which we inhabit

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
He does that by pointing to the

84
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
Close door button you push in the bush.

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
He says

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Just says matter-of-factly

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
About 80% of the van on function

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Oh wow

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Because they are broken and on fix them because they wasn't never wire

90
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
They would never ever wire to never

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
What's the time we going to do it

92
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
But 80%

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
I just assumed they don't work

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,464
You assume they don't lie so yeah I sweat no no no no no

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Know what I cannot be right we make cannot be right have you ever board close button that yeah that has had any

96
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,263
Psychological tool for you you need me button to go back up there something but that's not too but he said also

97
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
He had also a very

98
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Fan series

99
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
Most expensive

100
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
They're extremely intelligent

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Yellow is actually remember what happens everyday

102
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
So the elevator system knows that

103
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Between

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
855 + 9

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Wechat 373

106
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
People in an average morning come

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
So we're going to return to cars to the main floor as soon as

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
We possibly can

109
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
We're not going to park anything up

110
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
But it knows that

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
At 4:45

112
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Because 650 people leaving the building you get three wheelchairs to get to old people that and so we programmed

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
Timing of the elevator to accommodate the whole

114
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
All you doing is screwing up our timing by touching that thing I mean you have thousands and thousands of people

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
Anxiously trying to urge the machine to do their will watching people just stupid

116
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
This is cruel I have to tell you

117
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,351
His idea that we would somehow have the authority or the power to close the door with a pencil

118
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Am I building they work

119
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,775
I'm sympathetic to that Viewpoint to be sympathetic

120
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
The crazy ass vertical stack of humanity

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
How is that going to work if not for

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Beautifully designed

123
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
Systems like the

124
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
This is about Freedom. This is about who

125
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Began looking around for some

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Little Chute

127
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Song of poop

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
To give the Radiolab distance

129
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
Some tiny bit of power they can have back in this other Leaf assisted suicide

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
And you found it

131
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
You did we get what did you find

132
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
We have those we have packed the close button

133
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Really

134
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,151
Wait. I'm suddenly in for the first time I missed it what what what did you discover the next time chat

135
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
If you walk into an elevator

136
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
The door closes

137
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
Mysteriously although you're going to the 8th floor

138
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Apps on five

139
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
The door open

140
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Upir out

141
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
There's nobody there

142
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
6

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
English

144
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Will robots

145
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Leaving you powerless on hapless

146
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
But not anymore

147
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Now here's what you can do

148
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
I will check this and it's

149
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
You can put your arm

150
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Through the door

151
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Breaking the beam with your arm and then get your own back Teresa

152
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
That will convince

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
Stupid stupid supine elevator

154
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
That you have just

155
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Someone who just entered the elevator

156
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
And now it will close that was shaving amazing 3 5 Seconds

157
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
We will give you that sense of using Superman and 45 minutes of your life.

158
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
You're welcome

159
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
I should just say

160
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,359
Patrick was actually really awesome guy send everyone into the elevator History Museum

161
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
So the next story

162
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
This is maybe the most

163
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Valuable

164
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
I button

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Exactly it's

166
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
The he was a guy and his name was

167
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Button Gwinnett

168
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
What is it

169
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Button Gwinnett button

170
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Is that his real name that's his real name

171
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
That's Bobby Livingston from R&R auction house in Boston

172
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Button Gwinnett

173
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
Button Gwinnett is one of two signers of the Declaration of Independence that

174
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
We're born in England and moved to the United States were moved to the colonies

175
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,599
He is a founding fathers founding fathers signature thousands of times

176
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,463
And anything about that signature gets interesting in a minute

177
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
Button Gwinnett was born in England in the early seventies

178
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
890 moved

179
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Did George Anthony

180
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
55 Bar and Island and

181
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
I believe he began

182
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
A import

183
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
St. Catherines Island

184
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Debtor actually and everybody

185
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
He don't have anybody money

186
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
He failed in his business

187
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
He became a radicalized revolutionary and he joined Georgia politics late in the

188
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
17 six

189
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
And when it got to be 1776

190
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
In Philadelphia he was in Independence Hall

191
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
And he sang

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
The

193
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Really it's the left

194
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
And below

195
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
John Hancock

196
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
But then he goes home to Georgia

197
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,431
And gets in a duel with his political rival and it killed in 1777

198
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
And

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Then

200
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
I believe in 1780

201
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
His wife passed

202
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Is away leaving only his daughter

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
And then by 18.

204
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
His daughter passes away in his lineage

205
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Is disappeared

206
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
So listen to history

207
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Yes

208
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
But his signature is on that

209
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Very important piece of paper

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
True which becomes important

211
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Because around the 1820s the last

212
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
Of the signers of Declaration of Independence were dying

213
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
So there was a nostalgia

214
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,855
Who are the founding fathers and that's when people began collecting signatures that replaced on that document

215
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
So people collect the Jefferson

216
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Adams

217
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Hancock

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,095
And they started thinking okay I want a whole set of the 56 men that sign that document people want

219
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
That they want the separate American

220
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,471
I don't think there was any more important signature than them

221
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Signatures that replaced on that.

222
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Get them all

223
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
In a problem

224
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
A rose

225
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
Button Gwinnett signature they were almost impossible to find a hundred and some-odd years later

226
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,111
I went to see his collection and get a beautiful house in Florida

227
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
Overlooking the bay I won't tell you which Bae but

228
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,327
You show me some great stuff and it's what else you got Nico's I swear he pushes a button on a wall begins to ride

229
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
He's got like

230
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Incredible in a Wilbur Wright

231
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
George Washington button

232
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
I could see in the middle of my eye goes right to it the unmistakable signature

233
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,735
Button Gwinnett is like the centerpiece of a secret walk

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
And I don't like goodness that was pretty amazing the autograph equivalent of some really famous

235
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Miss Diamond do you know where something like that it

236
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
You know it's the Holy Grail still exist

237
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
There are 50 51

238
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
51 non examples

239
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,959
In the world mostly things big sister I owe you

240
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
If you have one of these things what's it was where they worth I'll tell you this it is more valuable

241
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Golden Lincoln much more

242
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
100 times more than

243
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
What about George Washington Ben Franklin yes

244
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Yes let machine it outside

245
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Abscess Ben Ben Franklin was a world-famous

246
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Ben Franklin

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,559
Was a man of letters he wrote tons of letters he was president of Pennsylvania he was there bastard or France

248
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,911
He wrote and wrote and wrote and sign and sign and sign so there's

249
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
With the exception possible

250
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Exception of

251
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
William Shakespeare

252
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Describe a Button Gwinnett

253
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
Rent a bunch that did basically nothing else in his life

254
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Mosto

255
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Valuable signature

256
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
In the world today what makes it

257
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
Extremely hard to complete a set of side of the Declaration dependence because of the 5141 are in libraries or

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,511
Institutions in the never be able to get it so that only 10

259
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Examples

260
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
In public hands

261
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Hello sir

Gwinnett Public Library

267
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,735
I believe the reading room is still closed but we're going to a kind of

268
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Super secret place where you know

269
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
I need to ring a bell to get a

270
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,391
Really

271
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
Thomas Lannon I work in the main switch narcos division at the new Republic

272
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
He took us into a special room on the top

273
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
On the top floor

274
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Wow

275
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Awesome all by yourself

276
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
What does I got to put him on the wood

277
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
Representing it up at a wooden what kind of beautiful old wooden table

278
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
And we have

279
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
On the table

280
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
4

281
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Button

Fourth wave on Justice

284
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Appreciate

285
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Tell me one of these is worth you don't know until they're sold cuz they're different quality but the last one that we know of that was

286
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Sold here in New York

287
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
What's sold for

288
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,095
720 2500. I'm not in the business of estimating value of things

289
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
But I can say that Button Gwinnett autographs at the New York

290
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Public Library hours

291
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Classified

292
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Splendid

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Highest-ranking splendid

294
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
They're not they're not

295
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Simply

296
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Cut autograph

297
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Document

298
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Sign

299
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Best looking fish

300
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
This is the most

301
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Extravagant

302
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,855
Seals on it like red wax seals

303
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,231
So for me that the impulse impulse I'm having right here is not

304
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,839
Just putting it in my pocket running away like a damn plus I'm having and I'm being totally Frank here

305
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,167
Is that is the same impulse I have like you know when you want to pull the

306
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Fire alarm like I just wanted to tear these all up right now

307
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Kind of

308
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
I just wanted to

309
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Take all of these papers

310
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
That we're honest

311
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Table

312
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,759
And just tear them all to shreds I guess I can speak to your desire to 22 Destroyer

313
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
And then the guy really looked alarmed but I really don't really want to

314
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
It's so arbitrarily valuable like

315
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
I could just rip it up

316
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
But it is

317
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
Okay so taking a cue from love it when we come back we're going to take a decidedly

318
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Auntie button turn

319
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
We'll be right back

334
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,623
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

335
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
And I'm here because I need your help

336
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
And I've requests

337
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,143
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

338
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,215
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

339
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Williams

340
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
Basically I want to hear about this

341
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
Did you know did something

342
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,175
It just means you lean back and say whoa

343
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
How do they do that

344
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,063
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

345
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
To you

346
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

347
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,487
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

348
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,351
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

349
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

350
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Have anything to do with it

351
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
If you have a story

372
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
I mean that's what we want everyone in Hollywood

373
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
We just figured okay let's go find the button

374
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
That

375
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Destroys the world

376
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
We brought in a friend of mine Alex wellerstein

377
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
All things

378
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Nuclear weapon related

379
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
He sat down in

380
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
The first thing he

381
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
With that

382
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
No button

383
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
There has never been a single

384
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
But when you get to like 1950

385
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
T2 1950

386
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
T3

387
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
In ordinary parlance people say where the president has his finger on the button

388
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,591
And I don't know where that phrase comes from the butt

389
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
It's older it's much older than the bomb

390
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,223
Real so 1910s is when all of the stuff

391
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
HG Wells

392
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
The famous but there's there's all this literature about

393
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,951
The crazy scientist who invented a new form of gas that can like Kill Everybody

394
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
And he has a button

395
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
I need a red button I don't know if they say read

396
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
But it's definitely a button

397
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:44,191
According to Alex by the time we develop nuclear weapons existing imagery about

398
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
The scientist can blow up the world using their button

399
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
Transfers to the president can blow up the world use

400
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
In his butt

401
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
I meant Alex told us something that we

402
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Surprises

403
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
He said when the US government dropped the first bombs on Japan so

404
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,903
The bomb that they dropped on Hiroshima and they didn't take off with the bomb armed

405
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
They took off

406
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
What's a bomb missing a piece

407
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
And the missing piece is except

408
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
It's a chunk of uranium

409
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,143
And then one of the scientists who was also a military guy

410
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Crawled into the back of the

411
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Displaying while it was in route

412
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Opened up the bomb

413
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,639
Put the missing piece back into it and then close the back up again and turned on all the electrical switches

414
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Zedd

415
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
If we drop you off a plane you're going to have to detonate it will explode when it's a certain number of feet off the ground so presh

416
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
And as for finger on the button

417
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,487
The finger which belong to Harry Truman president of states

418
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
With 11 time zones removed

419
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,607
And frankly unaware of the app

420
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Truman

421
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
He didn't issue an order himself he started

422
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Approved

423
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,615
An order that was already being issued from the Secretary of War to the Commander's out there and it said

424
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
You have two of these special bombs

425
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Special bombs

426
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
And here are your four targets you can drop them off

427
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
You could drop them on Hiroshima Nagasaki

428
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Quora and you could drop them on niigata

429
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Any day after August

430
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Third eye drops

431
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
What

432
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
He said here's a

433
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,167
A couple of different options choose choose for some days

434
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Go for it

435
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
No way. The only considerations are operational so the bombing order says you have

436
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Have to be able to see the target before you draw

437
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
And that's it

438
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
One of the interesting thing is that I

439
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
I cannot later there was it a town called

440
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Okura

441
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
And that was the

442
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Plan B

443
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Town

444
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
Far city rather for her Oshima

445
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
But the weather that they happened to be good in Russian

446
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
So they dropped it there

447
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
And then

448
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
The next time it was I was actually the plan a city

449
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
For Nagasaki but the weather was bad there

450
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Incidentally the bomb Nagasaki

451
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
The city of Corrigan got speared twice like you

452
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
It was so close

453
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
And so true and doesn't even know

454
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
He he gets hold oh by the way we dropped

455
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
The bomb yesterday

456
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Give me when the bomb dropped on Hiroshima he had no idea if he didn't know what day

457
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
The second bomb he seems to have been caught off guard

458
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
And he actually issues this is his only way of getting involved issues

459
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
An order with says

460
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Stop dropping atomic bombs

461
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Until I tell you to

462
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,287
I feel like if you're if you're a president and you're going to do that to that many people

463
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,407
I feel like you should be directly responsible should not be an arbitrary decision

464
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Like I kind of want to but in this case no

465
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
No no no

466
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
You wouldn't actually want there to be a bug

467
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
You can bump up

468
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
Make a button to easy

469
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,255
Right you don't want to be easy enough that you set your coffee down on the Oval Office table and like

470
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,839
Kill the world right like obviously nobody wants to do that nobody wants tonight

471
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,423
I think it's you know I have to admit when you first

472
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Bitching about

473
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Where are they going to go

474
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
And the more I was thinking about

475
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
It's a deep concert right it's about the ease in which

476
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
You could actually

477
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
Destroy all of civilization

478
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Because of the technology

479
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,391
What you could not do in the 19 century you could not do with Genghis Khan you could do a lot of damage

480
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
But he could not kill

481
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
You know

482
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
All the people in the

483
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
The button is the symbol of how easy that is and the reason this becomes kind of crew

484
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:32,032
I'm moving to the 50s into the 60s

485
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
Are vulnerable early 60s the United States is in a face-to-face with with over

486
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
Cuban missiles

487
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Really really close to Annihilation that works at this time is it the president has an assistant

488
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
Who has all the nuclear codes

489
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
In a briefcase

490
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Handcuffs

491
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
To the assistant

492
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,776
I'm your system if the president is in the bathroom the assistant is outside the door in the Carter if this present is at a ballgame

493
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,128
The suitcase is called the football and I believe the

494
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,712
Page with the nuclear launch codes on it is called the biscuit

495
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Why

496
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
I have no idea where it got the name

497
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
So it's the sixties and things between the US and Soviet Union are very tense and there are generals on The Joint Chiefs Curtis

498
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
Bombs away Lemay all troubled by the possibility that this would be

499
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
They would use and they advocated very specifically in very specific case there are no buttons and there are

500
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,712
These code people are still worried at the time about just how easy it would be for the president to launch a nuke

501
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
Types of in one guy in particular guy Roger Fisher

502
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Academic policy

503
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
He's a Harvard Law School Professor he advised secretary

504
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Update on.

505
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,328
Iran hostage crisis on the israel-egypt peace Accord he he definitely had the ear of the

506
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
He

507
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Trouble by this idea that

508
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
The president could

509
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
Prairie dispassionately

510
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Start nuclear war

511
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Italy proposes

512
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,688
I'll jump in the ocean comes from his long interest in reducing the risk of War

513
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
Roger Fisher passed away but we were able to talk to him

514
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:24,160
Amelia Fisher I'm a professor at Dartmouth and I'm Peter Fisher I'm a senior fellow at the tuck School of Business at Dartmouth

515
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
His

516
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
Solution to this by the way this would be just in the case of a

517
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
WS

518
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Surprise attacks

519
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Call the first strike

520
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Was

521
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,168
2 instead of having all the codes be just a suitcase

522
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
This idea was together volunteer who have the codes

523
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Put under their heart

524
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
You embed the codes

525
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
And some sort of caps you all in the guy's heart

526
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,456
Surgically any carry around a briefcase with a knife in it

527
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Butcher knife

528
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,552
And if the president ever felt the urge

529
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,136
The fire off the missiles he has to go to the guy and say

530
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Well now it's time

531
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Give me the knife

532
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
And then you have to take the nightstand

533
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
Drive it into the guy's chest

534
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
The president has to

535
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Chop out

536
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Xcode from the sky

537
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
Parked where they don't have to kill someone and pull the code out of their body

538
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Then he would have to first kill one person

539
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
In order to get at the codes that would let him kill millions of people

540
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
You have to look at someone and realize what death is

541
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
What an innocent death is

542
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Blood on the White House

543
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Carpet

544
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
It's reality brought home

545
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,696
Fisherman says that he suggested this to friends in the Pentagon and their reply was

546
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
My God

547
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,304
That's terrible having to kill someone to distort the president's judgment

548
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
He might never push the button

549
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Big strongest objection is it might work

550
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
But even now I think you know

551
