1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,552
Jtime Jedi run I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and today well today

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,368
The story of an axe-wielding nun

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,208
Coming through a window to smack some staphylococcus

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
I take you back to the future

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
Exactly

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,864
The Story of O

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
Story comes in two parts both of our producer lots of Nasser

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Did he respond

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,848
So the way the story goes it starts in 1928

13
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
1928

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Alexander Fleming The Story Goes who knows if it's apocryphal or not is growing stuff staphylococcus

15
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
In his lab that's why she's a science writer

16
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,464
Staff is a bacterium that lives on our skin

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Especially like

18
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
Parts of the body that are

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Warm and damp

20
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,216
Up our noses or genitals there in our armpits places like that

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:18,336
And generally it's no big deal doesn't really do us any harm but if it gets into a

22
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Scratcher

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
Hot and makes its way inside our bodies

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Stop

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,576
Goes from being as benign companion to being potentially deadly

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Anyway

27
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
London 1928 Fleming is growing staff

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
In his lap

29
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
In these little.

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
And

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Was a slob

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Basically

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
And

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Eagles on vacation

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Leaves his

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Petri dish

37
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Auburn bacteria

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Around leaves his window open

39
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
End

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
Something blows across his lap type

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
Tiny little speck of a thing just

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Floating through the window and comes to rest

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
On one

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Until a few weeks later Plumbing finally

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Back from vacation

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
He needs to use those lab place again and he and his assistant go to clean them off

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
Diamond you'd imagine that she would see some

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
Real

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
Nice furry

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Lawn of

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,520
Staff just overflowing right out of the

52
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Play because it's been sitting there

53
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,408
But on one of the places they pick up they realize that

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
It's almost polka dot it's got a little dead zone

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,368
All over it little patches where the staff is

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Dead

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Dead patches in the something blew through the window landed in the dish and starts

58
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Killing the bacteria in Fleming looks down at his

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Is play

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
He sees that at the center of these

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
You know

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Staff dead zone

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
There's a tiny Speck

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Natural mold

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
They realize that that mold is a

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Expressing a compound

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Killing the staff

68
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Around it

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,088
It's like emanating rays of death for the compound that compound is called

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
The first

71
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
True antibiotic infectious diseases that have been killing people for as long as we had been people

72
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Suddenly could be stopped

73
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,216
It just blew in through the window that is the that is the story that's always been told

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
However it got there it was

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
It was amazing

76
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
It was a miracle it was called the miracle drug

77
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,944
It was just it was really was a moment when the world changed when Fleming was

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,552
Put on the cover of Time Magazine this is 1944 height of World War II

79
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
It was a picture of his face and the

80
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
Banner on the cover said

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
His penicillin will save

82
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
More lives

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Then War can spend

84
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
And this is

85
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
I had no idea about this

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:02,176
Virtually at the exact same time when Fleming's face is on the cover of Time Magazine like 2 months later

87
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Stanford researcher

88
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Publishes that he has found

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Five different

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Strains of

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Stop

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
The do not respond

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
2 pennies

94
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Really

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Yeah this is happening

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
While he's on the cover

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
Virtually the exact same moment and it's the first

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Fine

99
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
That

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Stuff

101
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,215
Has responded to the penicillin in the world by developing resist

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Doma flag

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,127
Set producer Stone wheeler the era of penicillin was over before it began

104
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
Before it's even released to the General Public

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Wow.

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Penicillin

107
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Resistant staph

108
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Moves across the globe

109
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,463
End in 1957 in Cleveland some scientist gather together and they are in a panic

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
They have no idea why they've lost the antibiotic miracle

111
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
So quickly

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,447
The scientists across the globe for their brains together and try to come up with a new drug next amazing

113
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Edit 1960 they get methicillin

114
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
And it works for about

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
11 months

116
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
11 month

117
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
And so we started this

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Armstrong

119
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
There was a bug

120
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
And then there was a drunk

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
They took care of it and then there was a better bug

122
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Ashley found this list

123
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
You want to hear it

124
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
Streptomycin 1943 resistance 1948 methicillin 1960

125
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Resistance 19c

126
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
61 clindamycin 1969 resistance 1970

127
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
LeapFrog or you can think of it as a whack-a-mole Brazil in 1961 than 1973

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
Carbenicillin release 1964 resistance 1970s

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Drug development was doing really well for a really long time for a cylinder introduced 1980

130
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Resistance 1981

131
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Their best interest

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
The end I have on this list is

133
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
When is OLED which is introduced mm resistance mm into a few more but you get the idea

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Antibiotics

135
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
The entry of new drugs

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Market

137
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Fell off a cliff

138
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,927
Why it takes 10 years in a billion dollars to get to the point where the drug is Market

139
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
But as soon as you get the drug on the market the resistance clock

140
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Is running

141
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
So you

142
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Probably won't make your money back

143
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
And as you probably heard we now have these

144
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
Situations a warning from the Centers for Disease Control about the spread of a string of germs

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
So-called

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Superbugs

147
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,199
Are now turning up in hospitals and the patient dies

148
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
There are now bugs that can resist all of our

149
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
I've seen

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Physicians breakdown weeping over this it's not the way that medicine is supposed to fail anymore

151
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,839
I know that that possibly the

152
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
The origin story of penicillin

153
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Apocryphal

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
It's all a little suspect but you know just to enjoy imagining

155
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,591
For a moment like it just seems like if that happened was just open up a bunch more windows

156
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Something out of blow in

157
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
So we could wait a long time

158
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Right I mean we had staff had been around

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
For millennia

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Before 1928

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
But you know the whole reason

162
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
I wanted to do the story is because

163
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
There is a

164
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,095
New window it's a different kind of window window next

165
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
Window Nexus in Petri dishes

166
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Kind of a window next

167
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
But it's totally different kind of window

168
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
What kind of window is it

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
What is something blow into the window

170
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Yeah but it's not mold

171
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
It's way more fun than

172
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
It it it it it

173
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
There is an axe

174
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
How about that it's a person

175
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Baby

176
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Hello

177
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
This is Isabel and the birds

All right guys out

186
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
And I'm here because I need your help

188
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
And I request

189
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
For those of you who

190
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

191
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,887
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments child brilliant

192
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
Basically I want to hear about this

193
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
When a kid you know did something

194
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
It just means you lean back and say

195
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
How do they do that

196
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Maybe it was the moment that I

197
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,223
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

198
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
Or maybe the kid was a piano

199
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,879
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

200
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Or maybe the kids in math class

201
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

202
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
We're interested in the

203
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Epic moments where

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
A kid does something super smart

205
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
It doesn't have anything to do with it

206
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983

00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
We try to hook it up to

372
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Are you ready to cook

373
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Oh I'm ready to go

374
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Behave

375
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,015
Okay it goes like this

376
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,903
Wow that's the first line of the recipe and right off the bat

377
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
That first ingredient would strongly urge

378
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,143
Nobody quite knows in a water test but luckily just a couple words over

379
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Ungodly hour

380
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Second ingredient garlic

381
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
Which sum is an allium species

382
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,895
Cropley at me know this was another alley on top of the dictionary of Old English

383
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
I'm tells us that I figured probably what they were dealing with

384
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Onion

385
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
Carly could we didn't know which one so he's okay which one that has onion and one that has a leak

386
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,975
But we did it anyway

387
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Peel the onion

388
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Chop it up

389
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Disable a garlic recipe that doesn't tell you how much

390
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
So you take out the measuring cups do you measure at equal amount

391
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Is a pestle

392
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
And then after that

393
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
It says

394
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Big Canoe wild well

395
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
Pounded well together

396
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Okay

397
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
Lots of lots of time with the Voltron Paso muscles built up from wielding a sword for pounding the ingredients

398
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Starting me more

399
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
Third ingredient you wouldn't have nothing around your kitchen

400
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Oak School

401
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
Skull face

402
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:01,247
What are you going to kill the cow and go Reach Out And Touch the extended ingredient in microbiology labs

403
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Ox bile

404
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Today in 2015 you can buy

405
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Should not just buy them

406
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
Here we go here we go added to the onion and garlic ingredients

407
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
Red wine white wine with

408
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,543
Choose and we don't know who really did they have red wine that they have white wine what was the alcohol content

409
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,663
But I just figured out that the monastery

410
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Wealthy

411
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
She figured out where they're Vineyard

412
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
I'm just down the road that's is more than organic formula

413
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
So they use that one

414
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Dave Coulier

415
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Just want to point out how different

416
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Italian

417
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Soolantra doll

418
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Once you get all that stuff

419
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Together

420
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Yuan to the final

421
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
Specifically told that you have to mix

422
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
These ingredients together in a brass or bronze pot

423
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
I don't have one so we had to divide 2 pieces of a have a couple that would have been invited

424
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,807
Time do we have to do some research but they figured out that the

425
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,647
Hopper of today that is most like the copper of a millennium ago

426
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,511
Was actually cartridge brass which is what's used to stand it in plumbing fittings

427
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
A few pennies

428
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
We actually

429
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
World War

430
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,311
It looks and smells like quite a nice quiet a noisy Soma suit

431
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Clearly we

432
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,967
Botch this whole thing

433
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Honda mowers

434
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
And finally

435
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Directions say we have to let the whole thing sit for a while

436
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
Has to be stored for 9 days and nights

437
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
One day goes by

438
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
My two days

439
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Before

440
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
Six seven eight nine

441
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Later

442
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
You ready

443
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
On the modified

444
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Arena through class

445
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Then you have to strain it too

446
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:16,672
The liquid that comes off you apply to the person's eye with liquid

447
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,744
Don't matter

448
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
Say bets the lock the door

449
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Now clearly we didn't have any staff.

450
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Try this out on but

451
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Freya in her lab

452
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Jimmy D's mock wounds

453
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,848
Swifty's little plugs of a collagen says it like jelly

454
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,944
Made to become like a flesh wound infected wounds with bacteria

455
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,784
Then he put his thousand-year-old recipe that has been standing there for nine days

456
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
They put it

457
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
On the back

458
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Material that was in the fake one

459
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,928
We obviously where we didn't think this

460
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:55,328
This is going to work no we saw in I've given the ingredients we might see some small killing effects on the bacteria

461
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
. but it won't be anything to write home about

462
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,728
10% and 20% of the bacteria when they came back

463
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Next day

464
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
That was a stuff masicka

465
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Went on a rampage

466
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
It went on a staff

467
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Ramp

468
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,016
It was killing you know 99.9999 9%

469
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,648
Cereal so yeah first we thought we made some sort of mistake

470
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,536
And this is some kind of sleep you know we accidentally mixed up our plates Obits label something so

471
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
They would run the entire experiment again

472
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
The grad ingredients Mash'Em up

473
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Put on somebody

474
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Serie A

475
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,776
She's absolutely wiped out the bacteria and have them Daddy

476
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
Any third time at 4th and 5th and it works every time

477
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
And I suspect this is just telling you you really don't

478
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
See in your trigger some hiker playlist

479
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
And eventually they escalated from just regular staff

480
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
To the mercy

481
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
Methicillin-resistant

482
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
And this is one of the bad one

483
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
A superbug

484
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
New government data estimate that about

485
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
2000 people are dying of community-based

486
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Every year

487
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
So Christina and Freya they sent

488
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Some of bald

489
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Brew

490
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,616
To one of their collaborate

491
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,736
State-operated Kendra rumbling in Lubbock in Texas

492
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Put it on some MRSA bacteria

493
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
And then a week later

494
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Scent-free in

495
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Christine an email

496
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
I think it was actually three would respond so I said I think she just simply said

497
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
Bald best medicine had just

498
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Greek

499
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
Havoc on the mercy

500
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
If she stays beyond the walls

501
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Streams

502
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
Free and Christina made very clear that this is not yet a miracle drug I mean it's not even being tested in Hume

503
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
So absolutely

504
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Do not

505
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
Do this they don't even know

506
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
It might be that you don't do it in exactly the way we did nasty fungus could grow in it give you a question

507
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Infection so

508
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
We should not have

509
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
American Eyewear

510
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Domtar Ashdown

511
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
But the thing about this whole story that is

512
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,592
So intriguing and so cool to me

513
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Is this

514
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Time travel

515
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Which is so strange like it's like

516
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
The ideas

517
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Something

518
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Thousand years ago

519
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,624
Like a bullet Forge

520
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
1000 years ago

521
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
We could

522
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
We could use it now and then it could work

523
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
That that

524
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
The time-travel dimension of that is

525
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
So weird

526
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
It kind of makes you think differently about

527
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
I don't know program

528
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Song without you

529
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
Harrison

530
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
For example

531
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Just a few weeks ago

532
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
Bria and Christina got off in front of

533
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
The Royal Society of

534
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
Thank you very much

535
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Pleasure

536
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Bahia hotel confort

537
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Prince room hundred or so people

538
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
Apri actually got up

539
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,824
None

540
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Scientist

541
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Makeup look like

542
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
The results

543
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Ingredients

544
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
Cooking demo and then at some point

545
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Tina said something really interests

546
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
She was like okay sure we want to write this off

547
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Because it has demons

548
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Dragons

549
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Bealls

550
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
But are we

551
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
Sure that we know what they meant

552
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
By those words

553
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
Like for example

554
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
There are remedies which ask you

555
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Sing For Ava Maria

556
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
And we would say all that so

557
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
Distichous this is all in their heads But there again

558
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
We should also remember this is a. When people do not

559
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Watches

560
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
You do not have your nuts you know so that's

561
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Everybody knows

562
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
The Ava Maria

563
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
Everybody knows the length of an Ava Maria

564
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
So maybe it's

565
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
Maybe it's take this medicine and weight 20 minutes

566
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,744
And I know how to standardize 20 minutes which is

567
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,328
Full album

568
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,936
Appear one way and its it impact could be a totally different way

569
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Suggest

570
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
Stat the in order to time travel

571
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
He have to some out

572
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Got it so you don't even have to

573
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,920
The language people understand what they were doing

574
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
There's a phrase

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
That the past is a foreign country

576
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
We need to learn the language of

577
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
The doctor's office

578
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
Stop time we need to kind of

579
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Be a little bit

580
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Dismissive

581
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Lindsey Morgan

582
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
From them

583
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Island of Italy

584
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
But you were some reason why this is

585
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
Dokkan

586
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
USA map

587
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
1100 years

588
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Sizzix

589
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
Breezy long time

590
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Humans

591
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:02,272
And for bacteria that's like a exponentially crazy long time

592
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,600
That something that this man bald

593
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Was

594
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Doing to these back

595
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
Terrier then

596
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
Like like it's not even the same back

597
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,048
Yeah how could that even work

598
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,144
That's it that's an awesome question so you said one thing we put to think about is

599
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,448
But why do these medicines drop high with you

600
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
A maybe it's because when they were used

601
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
The bacteria evolve resistance

602
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
But no

603
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
1000 years later

604
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
When these medicines is not amused you would expect that resistance

605
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
This is something that

606
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Maryn McKenna mention disorganized

607
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,416
Sometimes when you take a drug out of circulation

608
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Sometimes

609
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
Resistance will decline

610
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
That doesn't always work

611
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
But sometimes resistance does the climb

612
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
So if we have been using this compound

613
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
True the ensuing

614
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
Thousand years then maybe it wouldn't work

615
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Steam Discovery there like

616
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
At what worked once

617
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
And then would resist

618
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
You give it a rest

619
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
I can work again

620
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
I will be resisted

621
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Can you put it to rest

622
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
If you had enough

623
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Different

624
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
You could go to different places

625
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
The different path

626
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
Did you go to China with a now got all these two

627
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
People studying Chinese

628
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Cures

629
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Yours Uke

630
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Come up with a

631
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
With a rich

632
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Historical cocktail

633
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
Of armamentarium that will work

634
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,032
If you bring them in take them out bring them in and take him out in the whole world

635
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
The whole world of the past then becomes the

636
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Food if your future

637
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
So it's also positive like a now I have a suddenly an image

638
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
It's possible that

639
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
This is Karen wheeler by the way

640
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320

Volkswagen

644
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
True

645
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
What we went through with Penicillin in that they

646
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
This guy wrote something in the book in the section

647
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792

649
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
He probably got on the cover of whatever their fur

650
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,216
Time was he got their Nobel Prize in Every Day celebrated and then

651
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,056
Years later styes were coming back in the garlic wine

652
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,616
Didn't work anymore and they stop using it and it

653
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
Put away and then

654
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,760
Here we are and we discover it and it's been put away long enough it

655
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
Like that now I'm thinking about future some future

656
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:18,464
It's civilization digs up an old medical textbook that was in some dusty whatever and discovered penicillin

657
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
And it works

658
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,656
