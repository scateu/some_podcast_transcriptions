1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
And NPR

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,704
Okay sir Robert you know that like talking about music in a way that's compelling to be kind of hard.

5
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,848
Project build a bridge into a well

6
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
I feel like you Gotta Give him props

7
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,552
And I just ran into a really great podcasts that I think everyone should be listening to is called meet the composer

8
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,184
It's from Hue to music which is sort of the digital sister station and wqxr

9
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
And

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Kind of what it sounds you know every episode they introduce you to one composer

11
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,632
But they do such a good job of seducing you

12
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,728
Into listening and maybe caring about music you wouldn't normally listen

13
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Care about

14
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
I just thought you I really want to play some of their latest episode for you because

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
They just focus on one of my favorite composers a guy by the name of John Luther Adams

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Show the Opera

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
Guy Jenna

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
John Luther Adams

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Different genres

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,696
Any other guy I've heard of John Quincy Adams was he was a former president

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
This John Adams

22
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Is a composer

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,888
Who makes music tutor Congress he's wide open spaces the kind of invite you in

24
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
It also seems to have been different to you and maybe

25
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
Mike Williams it has that kind of feeling to it

26
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
I'm intrigued okay so how does it begin

27
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Nightmare begins

28
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
By the way it's hosted by Nadia Sirota it begins

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
With John Luther Adams as a boy playing in a rock.

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Imagine fourteen-year-old John in a cover band in New Jersey opening for acts like Buffalo Springfield

31
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
And playing predominantly the 3 B's for the face The Beatles

32
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
The Beach Boys and the birds

33
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Okay

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
So we started out as cover bands

35
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
And

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
I got bored with that

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
One side of my buddies and

38
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,624
Oh over time we started trying iron pan dad at songwriting and

39
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
I was a big fan of Frank Zappa

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Frank Zappa the teetotaling 1960s

41
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Musician and polymath with wildly eccentric tastes spanning from Rock to Jazz to European modernism

42
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
Play gets me off as good as some contemporary classical pieces and on the back of

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
Frank's early LP is there would always be this

44
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Intriguing little quotes

45
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,464
The present day composer refuses to die

46
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,120
My Little Rock and Roll buddies and I wouldn't be dad and scratch I had someone Darrell

47
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
Who is this crazy guy

48
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Ends of one day my friends think I'm horn was rummaging through the

49
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
Condensed shopping list College

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
And came across

51
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
This album with this mad scientist on the cover letter

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Great shock of electrostatic gray hair bushy eyebrows

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,024
Stern countenance in the title was the music of Edgard Perez

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Volume two

55
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,424
So he brought it home and we quickly

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
What are the groups

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
Just all sounds like a bunch of noise to me

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
We have this desert does ocean this

59
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,856
Is forbidding mountains of of sound

60
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
I remember thinking

61
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
I'll never be able to know where I am in this

62
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,815
Don't know what to hang on to

63
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
So your response to what is this music was just too

64
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Immerse yourself anymore to any new experience

65
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Courage

66
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Young Musicians special young composers going to listen to everything you can get your ears on especially the stuff you think you did

67
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,111
Don't like I started to realize all okay there's that repeated

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Notes on the oboe and okay that's a landmark I can grab onto that no one hears this place where

69
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,143
Tattoo figure with a snare drums in these units and stabs in the rest of percussion there

70
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,983
Gradually we begin to learn how to listen to

71
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
The forbidding deserts of rent

72
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
Did that affect the music you guys were making the process that was already underway was just accelerated we

73
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,503
We rapidly abandon the the 1-4-5 chords and the BackBeat

74
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
And the four bar phrases

75
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
And started discovering cage Feldman and then Carol and Pauline oliveros endurance crossword

76
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
On and on

77
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
So thank you Frank Zappa

78
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Isle of the Dead

79
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
Who is his response to music bed

80
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
You know can be defined as very alienating

81
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
I mean it's not easy stuff

82
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
No

83
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
But instead of just writing off his ugly he was like

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Ugly how to turn in case just to skip forward a little bit in the music composer hour from Q2

85
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
John Luther Adams goes off to school

86
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
He has a teacher named I believe it

87
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,439
James Tenney one of his first big influences body goes off to school at calarts

88
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
And right afterwards he meets one of his next

89
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
I had just left calarts

90
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
Haven't yet gone to Alaska

91
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
I would take long

92
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Walks in the early morning and again at dusk

93
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
And I became captivated by

94
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
This

95
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
Singer that I kept hearing deep in the woods and I could never

96
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Find the bird box

97
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
I couldn't get enough of the song

98
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
I started taking notes

99
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
The birds became

100
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
My teachers

101
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,263
After James Tenney

102
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
And the result was a series of

103
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,711
Pieces that I composed between 1974 and 79

104
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Cold simply Songbird song

105
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
What

106
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
Was the translation process between

107
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
Hearing this Birds on that you just couldn't get enough of and constructing

108
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
A narrative

109
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
In working with the bird songs I just

110
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
Try to take dictation I try to listen

111
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Carefully to the birds

112
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Where they are as they're singing

113
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
And write down what I hear

114
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm not interested in

115
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Accuracy

116
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Because if I were I just

117
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,847
Make a recording and play the recording

118
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
I'm interested in what gets Lost in Translation because after all this is music this is perhaps a language

119
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
That we will never

120
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Understand

121
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Also there weren't very many field recordings available in those

122
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,663
Those days but there were some and I decided no I'm not going to use them

123
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
I really wanted to hear them and to learn them

124
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
For myself

125
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
I was actually very different from the way I work

126
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Much of the time

127
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Rather than working with very specific

128
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Details of the music and then building

129
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,583
He's up I usually sculpt away the whole field of sound and I work with one

130
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Big

131
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Jaipur

132
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Image War

133
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,055
Color or atmosphere than that I have in mind that I can't quite hear but I want to hear

134
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
And

135
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Try to hear that since that

136
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
Write that down as clearly as I can

137
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
And then all the moment-to-moment details

138
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
AllMusic follow

139
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
We're listening to excerpts from

140
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
An hour of computing music

141
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
From their fantastic series meet the composer

142
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,775
This one is on the composer one of my favorites John Luther Adams

143
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Song burpees

144
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
John's living in LA

145
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
And it gets kind of fed up

146
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
I hated Los Angeles the whole time I was there I felt

147
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Lost and not in a good way

148
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
It was such an interesting contrast because it was one of the most

149
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
Closest periods of my life in terms of of discovery

150
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,983
But at the same time other was asking to enter knowing I just felt lost in the freeways and

151
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
All that sprawling City that seem to just go on forever

152
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
It made me long for home

153
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
Which I never felt that I had because we moved all the time and I'd run up here and there and equally

154
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
Homogeneous Suburban surrounding inarticulate hunger to find a place to which I might

155
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
Belong the place where atoms belong

156
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
It turns out was off the grid in Wild open spaces

157
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
I went North in the summer of 1975

158
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Psalms 20

159
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,783
Shoe that summer ends from the moment I tried to enjoy downtown

160
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
When you showed up in Alaska

161
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
What did you see what did you hear that made you feel like you knew you were home

162
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Where to begin

163
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
It all really starts

164
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
MSR 1975 one

165
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
First canoed across Admiralty Island went into Glacier Bay and hiked on the tundra Denali

166
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,431
Eventually made my way to the port range to the Arctic

167
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,015
You know there was and still is

168
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Hand

169
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Those places

170
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
A sense of

171
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
Open this and space and

172
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Possibility

173
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
As well as

174
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Danger

175
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,911
These are Big places in which we feel very very small

176
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Only realized that

177
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:57,311
We're in significance and the place doesn't care if we are there or not

178
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
And

179
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
The weather

180
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Or the bear

181
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Orla River

182
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,063
Can rise up at any moment in snuff me out

183
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
And you know I find a certain

184
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
Reassurances certain profound comfort in that

185
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
I was trying to reconnect

186
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
With

187
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
The larger

188
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Older

189
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
World

190
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
That that we still inhabit but that we

191
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
That we forget

192
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,575
Unalaska

193
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Allow me to feel

194
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Like I was the only person in that place

195
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
Turn the summer of 1977 I visited the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and we Flew Over the crest of the

196
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,463
Strange and out onto the coastal plain the Arctic coastal plain in there the distance was the ice and

197
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
And of course the song even

198
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Even a midsummer the Sun

199
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Doesn't get very high in Horizon so this is

200
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
Incredible deep warm saturated light the colors in the shower

201
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Shadows and everything

202
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
Stands out and then you get out on the tundra and

203
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
You lose all sense of scale

204
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
I remember one evening with a buddy we are so excited to be alive and out and that Arctic

205
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Ceiling light

206
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
And we saw this White Rock

207
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607
I'll cross the tundra analysis odd looking things that well

208
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
When we walk over there only hook to that rock

209
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Show me high

210
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Bill kristol

211
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Country is not easy to walk on

212
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,223
But we kept walking we kept walking and you know that the rock didn't get any closer

213
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
So we kept walking

214
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
Suddenly stop

215
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Because

216
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
The Rock flew away

217
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Iraq was a snowy owl

218
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Sitting on the tundra

219
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
And apparently could have been a 12-foot outcropping of Whitestone you dispute

220
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
You lose yourself in that place in that wide into that endless space and that's what I'm

221
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Morning music that's a beautiful ordering bits from

222
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Q2 music

223
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
Meet the composer Series this one on John Luther Adams

224
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
Continue the moment

225
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359

230
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

231
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,239
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

232
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,639
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

233
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically

234
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
Kids you know did something

235
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

236
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
And you'd been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

237
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,727
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

238
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:16,127
Maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

239
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:22,527
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

240
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
If you have a story please share it with us

241
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

242
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Record a short audio message for us

243
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,583
Again that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

244
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,503
Where is Radiolab and we're taking a

245
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
This podcast to represent some music

246
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
I'm a

247
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Tanya Roberts

248
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,047
And I'm not I'm not good I take that as a sign of success

249
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
End of the exercise you've been hearing come from Q2

250
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
Is a wonderful series meet the composer

251
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
Particular hour that they've just produced on the composer John Luther at

252
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,359
2 after I move to Alaska begin to make these amazingly huge

253
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Sometimes the rain sometimes violent pieces

254
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
And you know what I think about one of yours work

255
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Give me when I first encountered Looney Tunes

256
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
And the way that the lexham

257
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Has assertive and inherent

258
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Meaning to it

259
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
Feels like falling

260
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,863
Put some music of action pumping pumping tiptoeing

261
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Bonking all these things have been kind of musical expression that feels almost like a physical language that we came into the world

262
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
With never had to learn

263
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
And when I went to music school

264
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
It was so

265
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Difficult indents

266
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
Because suddenly I was thrust into this world of contemporary classical composition

267
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
It was all about

268
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Understanding

269
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
The rigorous

270
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,839
Serial twelve-tone composition which is like you created in the mathematical systems that guide your choices

271
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
I was like I don't know what the

272
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
I don't understand this

273
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
And then you hear it you like I might your can't pick up on it I feel lost

274
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
You feel like you're literally in the forest

275
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Then I

276
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,663
I didn't count composers like John Luther Adams where it wasn't about that at all

277
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
Selling a primal it's about like the movement of body see no masses of sound that serve crescendo-decrescendo.

278
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,743
Waves I do think of the sounds of musical forms and events as

279
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Forces

280
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,607
As natural elements in some way

281
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
And

282
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
They may sounds ridiculously grandiose

283
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
Or laughably naive

284
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:58,175
But I've always imagined that I might be able to work in a space that's

285
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Just outside of culture

286
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Course is patently absurd

287
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
There's no way that we work outside of a culture

288
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
Police tase so many cultures

289
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047
And yet is my friend Barry Lopez the writer says landscape is the culture that contains all human call

290
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Vultures

291
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
And I believe that everything

292
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,519
We do everything we think everything we think we create

293
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
Who sing We Are The Rives

294
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
From the world we inhabit

295
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
R language

296
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
Our music are our minds

297
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Everything is is shaped by

298
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Incredibly

299
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
Complex and wondrous world that we inhabit

300
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,743
So ultimately this nature culture dichotomy

301
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
In a way doesn't exist

302
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,631
But it's been a useful conceit

303
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,983
For me to see all that I'm after something that that is

304
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
It's not

305
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Part of the musical tradition

306
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
It's not specifically cultural it's somehow more

307
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Elemental

308
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Where does music come from

309
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,767
How does a composer take an assignment like write an 11-minute piece for string quartet

310
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
Translate those instructions into a concept into notes

311
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Into a score

312
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,263
Free composer John Luther Adams it seems almost like the transformation happens in his sleep

313
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
I try to resist

314
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,431
Composing for as long as I can I really want to get it something

315
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Essential

316
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
Before I start

317
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Manipulating notes

318
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Pushing things around

319
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,695
I try to hold things in my mind ear as long as I can it's at its

320
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,071
Maybe an inefficient way to work but it has worked for me

321
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,375
I find that if I'm trying to remember

322
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Trying to hear something that I can't

323
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Quite

324
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
Name it focuses my attention

325
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
In a certain way and then I finally

326
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Start composing when I can't not impose

327
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
When I have to write it down

328
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Thinking about like the way that we are discovering how memory and the brain works and every time you remember something you're actually recall

329
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Creating a story

330
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
So I really like that you have an idea and you are continually remembering it so basically you're making a lot of mental Xerox is a

331
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,424
Yeah over and over again until it becomes something which is so steeped in your brain stuff

332
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
But it is

333
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
It is a piece

334
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Exactly

335
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
So night after night

336
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
When I lie down to go to sleep I'm

337
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Imagining

338
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
This

339
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Group of

340
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Instruments

341
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
In this particular space in

342
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
What they might

343
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Sound like end

344
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
How they might move through the space

345
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Physically and through the musical space of

346
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
The peace

347
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
And it's repetitive I'm doing it every night

348
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
Certain point I lose it and I drift off

349
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
To sleep

350
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,312
That nocturnal composition process

351
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
Is apparently what happened with John Luther Adams

352
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Most

353
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Recent most famous piece

354
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
The B-side I literally tried to copy

355
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
During a recent apocalyptical tour in the Pulitzer Prize

356
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
Apparently John was spending some time near the Pacific Ocean and you would fall asleep to the sound of ocean waves

357
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Steeped in his dream

358
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
And what emerged

359
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
We finally start to

360
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Compose was

361
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
This

362
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,800
Orchestral piece for three orchestras actually it's called commotion

363
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
What happens in the pieces that over the course of about 40 minutes

364
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
All three orchestras

365
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
Form these massive swells of sound like these three huge crescendos like massive tsunamis

366
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
Crashing over you

367
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
I'm talking about the title of a beast become ocean John Legend

368
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Adam said life on this Earth First emerged from the sea

369
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,736
The polar ice melts and sea levels rise we humans find ourselves facing the prospect

370
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016
It once again

371
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
We make quite literally

372
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Become ocean

373
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,256
Well. In a conversation with wqxr is Helga Davis this is a global warming piece

374
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,912
And I would say everything that I do these days is in some way

375
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
Addressing the state of the world and the Delicate Sound of precarious position of we human Anna

376
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Animals in the world

377
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:21,504
And yet I will also out of the other side of my mouth insist that it has absolutely nothing to do with

378
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,856
With current events or politics or activism and that music

379
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
Must stand on its own as

380
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Music

381
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
And

382
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
I like to believe that we can have it both ways

383
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
She's very very Outdoors

384
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
It's without

385
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
Like it doesn't have people in it at all

386
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
That's just

387
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Openness yeah yeah

388
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
You're floating on the surface

389
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
If you're there at all

390
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,248
One of the many reasons you should go to iTunes and download queue to meet the composer

391
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Hour with John Luther Adams if they play this

392
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Unreleased track of his string quartet

393
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
I called the wind in High places

394
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
