So here we go

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
I guess so this whole thing begins

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
With a guy

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
His name is Mark bold

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328

The toot and I met him at his offices in Lynchburg Virginia he's a big guy bald head bright blue eyes kind of be

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
Babyface yeah okay so I guess

28
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Take me back

29
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
2

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
Law school that the seeing how old are you where are you

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
How old am I

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
It's going to be

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
About 39

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,280
So back in 2010 he was in law school with the Liberty University School of Law

35
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
It was his first year of law school he was taking his

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Classical Foundation

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,752
It's just some of these foundational laws that we have been the basic Brown versus Board of Education

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
He had this moment that like

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
We have all probably had

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
This moment we are sitting in class and you

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
You're kind of tuning out and then you hear something that's like

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
What

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
What it what did they just say

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
Is Professor had just mentioned the Supreme Court case look for

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Spell gazebo

46
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Wasn't Buck V Bell

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Infrared for sterilization

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
I never heard of the case but that

49
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Circassian

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
What's a 1927 and originally started

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
Supreme Court held 8 to 1 that it is legal for a

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
State to forcibly sterilized its own citizens who are demons

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Quote unquote

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Unfit

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,968
Three generations of imbeciles

56
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,064
Exactly exactly three generations of imbeciles are enough

57
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
And I was blown away

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
By that decision

59
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,488
That reminded me of Germany cannot see this

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Idea that we're going to

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,448
You know forcibly sterilized are citizens of constitutional to do that for the betterment of its citizens for the betterment of

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Society but the thing that really shocked him the most which again you might also be aware cuz you are now illegal

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
But that I didn't know

64
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
When I first heard about this about 2 years ago

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Is that

66
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Buck V Bell has never been overturned

67
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Totally dumbfounded if you will that we

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Bilby

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
The book

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
I feel like I should say that like if you look at the law

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
You will find it there all kinds

72
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
The bad

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Rulings like that these days

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Terrible

75
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Laws

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Horrible past

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
Did it somehow stuck around with the idea is that no one's going to act on it

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
It just it's just sitting there

79
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
So that

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Okay so that

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Soundbite what you just said

82
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
That wasn't enough for Mark I became obsessed with

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Obsessed with

84
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
Wanting to know more about Buck vs. Bell what is it

85
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Dan today

86
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
And that question

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,168
Would end up sending mark off on this journey

88
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Pizza places in America

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
People in America or buck V Bell has not stayed buried in some book

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
What was Bushey house in here Sterling

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
What does case has been very alive

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
And Kicking

93
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
I'm at Walters

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
This is episode 4 of G

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
Baby Dory from Booboo about sterilization laws in the United States

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Darkside attempts to measure the human mind and fit people into boxes and

97
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,551
Reaches out into the present-day in ways I honestly never expect

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
And also

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Because the story of how we got the buck V Bell

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,023
Is all tangled up in the history of the IQ test that we got into an ER first episode

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
It begins with this guy who sort of moons over all of it

102
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
A guy I first heard about from writer Siddhartha Mukherjee

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Francis Galton

104
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Yes galten

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,151
British gentleman in the 1880s that is historian Paul Lombardo

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
Anyway Francis Galton he was a British scientist

107
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Have a polymath categorize a revolving thing

108
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
Walked around London with a pen in his pocket and a piece of paper

109
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,047
Quantifying the number of women that he found her attractive

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
On the left side of his pocket and that's in the Box full story and on the right side Fifi women that he did not find it

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Attracted to get a statistical measure

112
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
IOffer tracking

113
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
Everything kind of crazy thing is that he was related

114
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319
To Charles Darwin cousins and publishes his Opus on the origin of

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Species

116
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Princeton picks up his cousin

117
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Isabella

118
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
And I could completely shut him

119
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
And his idea was that this mysterious Falls of natural selection which seems to kind of invisible

120
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Naturally

121
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Sheep creatures into their most perfect

122
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Formed

123
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Man could harness this

124
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
And do the work of nature

125
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
Faster

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Better

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,135
Because through his measuring the statistics his research cotton had become convinced that it wasn't just

128
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Unilec

129
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,231
Physical traits that got passed down from generation to generation

130
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
But also mental traits the ability to think clearly the ability to remember well

131
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Almost certain all those things

132
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
Could be inherited

133
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
And not just physical and mental but moral characteristics and traits could be inherited

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
If you could measure everything is good measure these human qualities

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
Then you could read people just like you bread animals bring out the ones you don't

136
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Selectively eue really thought that he would make a better human race and he comes up with the word Eugenics which is Greek

137
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
For good birth

138
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Is that what eugenics means

139
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,143
He wants Eugenics to be a program of better breeding

140
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,007
City Stars unit touring Europe giving these lectures on this idea of

141
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
How you could create a happier healthy

142
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Her Society any publishes Magazine with posters magazine articles about it for describe

143
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Or how this would work

144
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Practically like how we go about doing it

145
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Yeah he this

146
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
Part I feel like less people know about he actually goes and writes

147
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Sci-fi novel

148
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Called

149
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Hats they wear

150
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Can't say where

151
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
And just never published it

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
But his and then after he died his Anis

153
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Tried to destroy it but a lot of it has been salvaged and typed up do you want to hear some of it I actually have it

154
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,895
Should say I really am tempted to do this in a Brit fake British accent but what do you think

155
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
Okay okay

156
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
OKC

157
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
I should say that they lay much

158
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
Aesthetic side of things that can't stay where

159
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
Sunset in a fictional town called can't say where

160
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Of the girls make the people themselves of can't they where he described them as promising mothers of a noble race

161
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
The good stock has for the men they are well-built

162
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,407
Practice both in military drill and Athletics are very handsome and very loyal but very modestly dressed

163
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Gay without

164
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Frivolity

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Friendly without gush

166
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Urgent without

167
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,879
And see if they never they never gossip hello just boy and an awkward girl

168
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Hardly exist

169
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
In this place

170
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
And the reason why people

171
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,583
Are so perfect in can't say where is that everyone who enters the society has to take

172
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
All sorts of physical test medical test

173
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Athletic test

174
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Static test and

175
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
If you do well

176
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
You're giving all this money and encouraged

177
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
To have tons of babies

178
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
But if you don't do well

179
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Such persons are undesirable as individuals

180
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Dangerous

181
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
Community you are sent to a labor camp

182
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
Told you are never allowed to have babies

183
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
And if you do the crime against

184
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
The state it is considered a

185
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Criminal act

186
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,583
Owing to the Practical certainty that they will propagate their kind if unchecked

187
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
So go strolling around with this

188
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Fanciful idea

189
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,335
But people thought this is a very good idea that I caught fire intellectual Scholars science

190
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
Just came to celebrate this idea

191
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Write the missing right

192
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
It is not my friend it went to

193
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
American

194
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
First

195
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
So

196
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
This was something I did not realize at all there was a huge

197
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Eugenics

198
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Praise in America

199
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Early nineteen hundreds

200
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,351
And what historians have explained is that there were all these

201
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Things

202
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Going on

203
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
There was this

204
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
Wave of immigration there were

205
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Yes just after the Civil War so there

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Freed slaves integrating into

207
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,175
Society there were Christians freaking out about crime and

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Promiscuity and drinking and

209
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
So all kinds of people really important people

210
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
Thought that these things were problems and that the way to solve it

211
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
What are eugenics

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
And that one of these people with whom I'm writing a book about

213
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:13,375
This is how I cry at all this so this is your Stanford guy

214
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm not seeing about this guy David Starr Jordan yeah

215
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,055
My dude was like one of the earliest loudest most

216
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
Powerful proponents of eugenics you can see like in the late 1800s which is decades before most

217
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,295
American nugenesis got the fever he's slipping it into his courses at

218
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Stanford so he's like telling

219
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Smart

220
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
People these ideas that

221
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Poverty is linked to the blood

222
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,559
And can be exterminated. These ideas out in front of like

223
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,703
Benjamin Franklin's 200th birthday party in the late 1800s where there's hundreds of politicians gathered

224
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
And he says

225
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
You know

226
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,079
This is a matter of life and death for the nation

227
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
And

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,223
He said that the Republic will endure only as long as the human Harvest

229
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Is good

230
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
That's a horrible

231
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Vista

232
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
What's the weather

233
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
Then you decide to write a whole book about it called the human Harvest and holding it right here

234
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Portable title

235
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
It's

236
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
It's it's horrible inside

237
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,543
She told to scare people he tells people about this town in Italy called aosta

238
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Which four

239
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383
About 1300 years was the start of refugee

240
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
4 people

241
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
You know with disabilities or deformities people send them there in the church would take care of them and then they can often get married in the

242
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
Work the fields and have families in their helps by the church and some people see that as this beautiful tail

243
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:46,815
I like helping society's most vulnerable and he went there and he wrote about it as a veritable chamber of Horrors

244
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Basically he says he describes

245
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,471
The people living there and say they have less decency than the pig

246
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
And he like

247
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
Says that it's a different is a subspecies of human

248
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,431
And he said this is where you know America's going to be going if we don't take

249
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Action

250
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Which

251
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
I totally did

252
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,279
So that day that I was with Mark gold he drove me to this place that it's just a couple miles from his office

253
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Call the Central Virginia Training Center

254
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
It's ominous

255
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
It is

256
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Campus on a Hilltop dozens of brick building

257
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
All turrets

258
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
They're all starting to rot iron to become dilapidated as you can see these are some of the first buildings there's acres and Acres

259
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Acres here at one point

260
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Place was

261
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
A very real version of Dalton sci-fi

262
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Dream

263
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
What does it say

264
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,351
This is established in 1910 as the Virginia state epileptic colony

265
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
The center admitted

266
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Its first patients in May 1911

267
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Sony richmeister persons with epilepsy

268
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Began accepting individuals with mental retardation in 1913

269
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,687
A very little in there about the start of sins of

270
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Of what

271
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
They've done in the past nothing in there

272
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Was established in Beijing

273
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
Can really as a

274
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,463
Eugenics facility in the condos at the colony really for

275
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
There

276
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Epileptic

277
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Cope feeble-minded

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
There's nothing in there

279
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
That really

280
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Talks about it

281
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Its main purpose was

282
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
2

283
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
How's individuals from the community in in

284
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Strip them from society and put them here

285
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
So they don't propagate their kind that's really the

286
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
The fundamental

287
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Reason for its existence

288
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
And this Colony wasn't like alone net worth

289
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Tons of them popping up all over the country like

290
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Is high-walled

291
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Holding tanks

292
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
Where people would be kept away from the rest of society

293
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
And in some cases

294
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Sterilized

295
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Which

296
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
When you think about what that really is

297
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
It's a form of extermination

298
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Like

299
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Fully wiping out

300
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
A certain kind

301
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
People with disabilities

302
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
People with mental illness

303
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
People who are immigrants

304
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
People of color because they were are seen as

305
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Not good

306
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
This is Ivan Nova Smith and activist Advocate and

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Historian the University of wash

308
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
10 inch explain that people who arrived at these sorts of

309
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
Colonies would be given

310
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Extensive

311
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
And they had different categories

312
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
And they use this concept called mental age Theory

313
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
To explain these different categories

314
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Moron

315
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
Imbecile idiot

316
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,527
And these were all diagnostic terms that were used to put us in it

317
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
The two cents

318
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
And then we used to justify

319
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Austria still alive

320
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Do you said us

321
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
What do you mean by that

322
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
That's why I identify with the until I saw disability Community I want to bet that I would have

323
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Bald cat

324
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
I'm autistic

325
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
11 twice with disabilities

326
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Do you think

327
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
In the eugenesis

328
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
This day like

329
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
Would you have been someone who is sterilized

330
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
I think I would have

331
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Because

332
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Are they there

333
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,111
They honestly it cuz the sterilization Ebola to the early 20th century because

334
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
We will more likely to be sexually active

335
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Savannah

336
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Ghetto game

337
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
Judo fighting boys

338
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:37,215
Boys by the girls you know which brings us back to Buckley Bell was she house in here Sterling

339
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Any particular

340
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
The kapok was a girl who grew up in Charlottesville Virginia

341
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
Is born in 1906 and she's mostly raised by her foster

342
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Your parents

343
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
She lived a kind of

344
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Totally normal childhood saying in the

345
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Church choir

346
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
High School

347
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
But when she was 17 she said she was raped

348
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
And she became pregnant out of wedlock

349
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
And as a result her foster parents sent her to the Central Virginia Training Center which in those days was called the

350
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Colony

351
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
For epileptics

352
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
And feeble minded

353
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
And when she got there she met this guy

354
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Superintendent

355
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Albert

356
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
So Albert pretty was a passionate eugenicist

357
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,967
And at the time 1924 there was starting to be some pushback

358
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
About Eugenics from churches social institutions politicians

359
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
And so

360
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Pretty was on the hunt

361
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
For the case

362
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
That would help to legalize

363
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
Eugenic sterilization at the national level

364
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
I'm pretty mcherry he felt like

365
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,727
She had hit the jackpot because he realized her mom was there at the colony her name is Emma buck

366
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,543
And she was allegedly a prostitute so

367
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,871
Did Carrie tested deemter feeble-minded

368
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:53,247
And then when he heard that a social worker had called carry bucks baby the product of this rape

369
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
Peculiar

370
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
He believed he had on his hands proof

371
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
At feeble-mindedness or unfitness

372
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
It linked to the blood

373
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
So he found her

374
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
He gives a he arranges to have a lawyer appointed to her you have to get up before you sterilize you have like a mini trial

375
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,959
And so the lawyer appointed to her was the sky Whitehead likely are you dentist

376
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Didn't give her a good defense

377
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,871
Didn't call forward any witnesses that makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court

378
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Where we get that ruling

379
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Carrie and Vivian

380
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Is 3 real people and people make it nationalized it where you could sterilize

381
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
I say so her case

382
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Pave the way for over 60000 sterilizations

383
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Performed all over the country and that ruling

384
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Still sits on the book

385
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Today

386
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Never over

387
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Well

388
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
All right

389
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Knuckle crack we have made it through that horrific history we're coming back

390
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Too bold

391
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Coming back to me

392
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
The Bold

393
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
Is sitting in law school

394
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
What

395
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Exactly just

396
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Totally

397
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
Dumbfounded if you will that we can go to professor and he's like how

398
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,255
Never been overturned and end in the professor says

399
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Every

400
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
State has since overturned it

401
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,703
So it hasn't been overturned because we don't have another

402
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Quote case or controversy

403
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Before us

404
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,895
Which is you know the thing that like all the legal Scholars they would you like was technically

405
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
Extended kind of purgatory don't worry

406
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
I ain't stupid

407
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Stupid ruling

408
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Like

409
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
CarMax

410
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Brat Twitter

411
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,775
Which basically like Roundup a whole bunch of citizens that are American citizens but

412
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Are Japanese

413
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Japanese American

414
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,199
For no other reason than their Japanese that's constitutionally wrong but they did it

415
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,295
And it's still technically good law so it's kind of in that like

416
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Oh that sucks.

417
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
No it's like I've been there other case

418
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
This is the other really terrible

419
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Positions that are in that space

420
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
So that

421
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Tons of people said that

422
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,543
Tim Tebow

423
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
The thing was that

424
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,431
Well a lot of my free time if you could say that as if you don't have enough

425
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
The doing law school right

426
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
Just started searching the the code of each state

427
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
Using keywords of feeble-minded and undesirable and sterilization and Eugenics and it's

428
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
Start looking at each and every state law alphabetically

429
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii

430
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi going through all the codes

431
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
Searching New Hampshire New Jersey New York Carolina North Dakota Ohio

432
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Daniel Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Vermont Virginia Washington

433
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Finally

434
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
You gots to

435
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
West Virginia and

436
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
There he sees it in this West Virginia Statute

437
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Chapter 27

438
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
Article 16

439
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
Entitled sterilization of mental defectives

440
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Talking about sterilization

441
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,151
For the best interest of society

442
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
The year 2012

443
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Totally dumbfounded

444
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,343
Something in the code that basically still said

445
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
You could be forcibly sterilized if you're unfit something or

446
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,839
Then you in the best interest of society can be sterilized

447
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Like oversight

448
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,007
Fortnite in use so he didn't know what I did is I wanted to find out

449
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Do we

450
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Don't do that

451
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
If I was a father

452
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Oh babe

453
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
Childhood

454
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,943
Had a disability some type of intellectual disability

455
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Can I forcibly sterilized my daughter

456
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,599
So you like to get himself in his own where he

457
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,696
Wants to pretend that he has an adult daughter over the age of 21

458
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Who he wants to sterilize

459
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
So I called this Circuit Court

460
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
What we he was

461
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,912
He was pretending so he's doing kind of like a sting like a one-man staying like let me see if

462
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
I called the state house and say I have a daughter who wants

463
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Sterilizing

464
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Will you do it for me or is that legal

465
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
Any record the call if you would like to

466
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
To hear it from you

467
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Yeah that be great thank you

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
Thank you think maybe the second time

469
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,184
Justin Mark I talked to you earlier this morning here when I was

470
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
Driving you called and you

471
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Told me to call you back if I had any questions or

472
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,608
What have you it is in regards to

473
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
My handicapped daughter and sister location

474
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
So I'm

475
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,312
Now have the chance to obviously sit down at the desk I took some time off work

476
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
And wanted to

477
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Find out what steps

478
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
What

479
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Come to me

480
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
I don't think

481
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Can I have a problem

482
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Okay

483
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
I'll get it to her and she'll give you a call

484
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
I just write a letter it is that what I need to do

485
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,688
What she says most of the time the judge that this was 2012

486
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Yeah

487
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
And under that motion

488
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Okay so safe mode

489
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
The number on the bottom

490
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
Okay this is not a

491
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
We're not going to be the first one to do this okay that's white because to us we feel weird about it you know what I mean it's just

492
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
You're not the first one

493
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,152
Exactly I don't think people understand this type you know these type of people they're difficult

494
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Okay

495
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
Basically the answer is a

496
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Resounding yes

497
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Needs to be done

498
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
It's common

499
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Don't worry about it I even

500
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Concern but what if people know with my neighbor's no no

501
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
No it's sealed

502
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
And get everything

503
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,128
Okay alright well thank you so much okay alright bye bye now

504
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
Get the guy

505
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
Really quick a couple of things first of all to be fair to her

506
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,440
It is not officially her job to judge whether or not so much to be sterilized it's her job to get that

507
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Question to judge

508
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,280
And second of all there is a legal difference

509
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096
Between sterilizing someone for eugenic purpose

510
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
For the good of

511
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Society

512
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,728
Like there's something wrong with them that may

513
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
He passed down to the Next Generation and threaten the race

514
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,104
Versus sterilizing someone for their own

515
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Quote unquote best interest

516
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,736
And there actually are a number of states today that allow

517
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,088
For a parent or Guardian to have their disabled child sterilized

518
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
For medical purposes

519
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Even if that person doesn't give

520
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,744
Cuz if they have a child they might die, thing

521
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah and some of the laws even talk about that person's inability to adequately care for a child

522
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216
Do you think the woman who is

523
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Responding to mark

524
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,152
Sing oh yeah we've done this before with that kind of case in mind or with more Eugenics beef-flavored case in mind

525
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,272
Honestly I don't I don't know I was able to find her but she said she couldn't comment on this

526
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
Case for the story

527
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
And numbers

528
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
How frequently sterilizations are done

529
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
Are really hard to find

530
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
But what is clear is that at the

531
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,352
Time of that call the lies It Was Written In the book

532
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
One of the reasons why a judge could approve of a sterilization

533
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Procedure is and I quote

534
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,800
That the individual is mentally impaired and that such defect

535
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,152
Genetic nature that it's likely to be passed on to any children

536
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Which is just

537
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Pure eugenic

538
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Reasoning

539
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Right so it's

540
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,832
The general welfare what's in the best interest of

541
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
Society not about what's in the person's best interests

542
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
And so I found a disturbed

543
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
So he was

544
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Horrified

545
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,328
And I wanted to put the nail in the coffin. He also this was kind of his like

546
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,168
Hero Genesis moment is a press release

547
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Wanted to pick a fight

548
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
The Christian lost his considering suing West Virginia Etc universe

549
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Eugenics forced sterilization law

550
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
The Charleston

551
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Gazette pick it up

552
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
And his idea was

553
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
I was really hoping

554
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
That

555
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
State

556
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Wood

557
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
Innocence defendant that we can together

558
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Get it before this

559
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Supreme Court said hey

560
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Overturn this

561
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
So his dream was like

562
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:15,168
I'm going to reach out to West Virginia and say let's do this thing and you defend the law

563
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
And then we'll get it the Supreme Court has his legal strategy was

564
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Suet

565
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,640
Make them up to something and just going to work its way up

566
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,528
But right after the article came out before the legislature and they just unanimously refill this

567
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
How fast did that happen with notified about a couple months after

568
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Immediately

569
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,584
Overturned because they were like we're West Virginia we don't want to be seen as up

570
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Holding

571
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
Eugenic sterilization

572
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,472
The great for the people of West Virginia

573
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
But Mark's bigger plan to overturn Buck V Bell

574
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,104
Spoiled and so

575
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
He starts thinking all right if I can't

576
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
Find Justice for people in the future

577
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
I reach back into the past

578
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
If I find it there

579
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976

Hate this is Radiolab we're back with Lulu Miller Story for G

593
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Before the break

594
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,768
Mark bold had gotten his West Virginia law struck down which he was excited about

595
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,376
But it also meant he couldn't use it to challenge a buck V Bell at the Supreme Court

596
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Alright so mark

597
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
Start noticing that West Virginia wasn't some kind of outlier there were all these other states that had their eugenic sterilization

598
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
Laws on the books until the 80s 90s

599
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Thousands show

600
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,760
I started looking into finding victim

601
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
Thinking he could maybe do something to help them

602
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
Get them some money

603
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Something

604
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
And pretty quickly he found some people

605
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
Regency you introduced me to a bunch of them including this one woman and a seal

606
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,216
I don't know how you feel about pie

607
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,264
Coconut cream

608
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360
Who is just a couple miles from the Central Virginia Training Center

609
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,408
To the Colony were Carrie Buck was sterilized

610
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
She's a sunny two bedroom apartments

611
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
Philipp Plein

612

With two birds actually

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
Her best friend Mary who she met at the Virginia colony

614
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
When she was young

615
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,304
We will keys in the throat

616
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Pokebean hats

617
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
V1

618
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
Small Ebonite

619
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Can explain it growing up

620
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Her family was really poor

621
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
And think of their parents

622
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Forbade

623
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Dead drink all time

624
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
And all these she said that she and her brothers

625
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Like often didn't have any clothes

626
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,784
300 Club of David have one of the neighbors

627
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
Reported that the kids were living it up

628
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Pain behind house

629
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Jibacoa now

630
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
Heating up and pretty soon the authorities came

631
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Take them away

632
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
And I was 7

633
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,192
Do you remember that what did they come in like a police car or truck or

634
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
A prank call

635
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
Gino Brothers were driven to the Central Virginia Training Center she's giving a bunch of tests

636
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
And they decided that Anna was

637
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Feeble retard

638
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Yeah

639
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
They issued her an inmate number

640
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
Cut her hair to happen

641
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,232
They were often forced to wait outside in the cold rain to wait

642
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Food

643
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
It'll work with Note

644
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Hey

645
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Years went by

646
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
And I was told she could leave

647
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Agree to be sterilized

648
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
But she said no

649
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
She had always wanted to have kids

650
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
And

651
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
So she said no

652
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,016
And ironically all that time her job at the colony

653
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Care4kids

654
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
I just get mad for no help getting back up at night

655
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
You would give them a bath

656
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Alipay

657
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
That one you know

658
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Yeah

659
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
And one day when she was 19 years old

660
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Two nurses came and said they were going to give her a checkup

661
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
And they gave

662
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
You should give her a math

663
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,336
I wish she thinks was ether and she felt the world slipping away and she was like

664
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
She figured she was being euthanized

665
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:23,648
I woke up and did you know when you woke up when it happened

666
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
What is it

667
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,024
Is it still do you still have a scar

668
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,840
I'm feeling very upset you know

669
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
It's over about two years mark

670
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
I found about a dozen people who'd been sterilized in Virginia if you know what my

671
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
Listen to them tell their stories about how they were taken from their families and in what happened here

672
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
And you know

673
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,304
If he goes down to the Virginia State Assembly General Assembly

674
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,632
Bring them rexana with him she remembers it

675
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
So what

676
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
He wants at this point is an apology

677
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
He wants a bill

678
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,080
To get some type of compensation

679
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,640
4 victims who were forcibly sterile

680
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,552
To go down to the Virginia state government and he makes this appeal he says Virginia was where the first supreme court sanctions there

681
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Elevation happen

682
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Virginia should be the first

683
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
To compensate

684
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Victims

685
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
And they basically pass

686
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Like I said no thank you

687
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,840
Yeah what did what did they say in his opinion he thinks it was

688
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Pretty much about

689
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Money comes of conservative but it's so fiscally conservative

690
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
So frustrating about this was that he didn't really have the support of like

691
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
People

692
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
People who

693
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
I'm Republican just a phone just

694
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
For what it's worth

695
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:57,856
We have this idea of pro-family and here you have these guys please Champion that one more profound how about the right to have a fan

696
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Taking a babysitter pro-family you know

697
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Get pro-life about the right to give life

698
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
I'm saying

699
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
And

700
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
So just saying so hypocritical to me

701
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Just find it

702
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Repugnant

703
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Still make me angry

704
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
To this day right face change it's like a

705
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Install this app

706
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
Yeah yeah because

707
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
The house budget set aside about just a few months later

708
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Shalimar schools with the justice for sterilization victims project

709
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Carolina

710
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Providing relief to those citizens

711
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
That this state has injured

712
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Is the just

713
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
And righteous

714
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Things to do

715
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Time is running out

716
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
And they award everyone who's been sterilized

717
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
$50,000

718
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
And they say they're sorry

719
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
And then a couple years later Virginia passes it but then Virginia only gives $25,000 which

720
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
You just felt like with such an unnecessary slight

721
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
But

722
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
For Anna we got paid

723
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
So what does that mean is it like

724
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
The help

725
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
She gets about $50 a week

726
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
And she uses it to

727
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Help with the groceries

728
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
The Bells

729
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Medicaid

730
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
And she used a chunk of it

731
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
To treat her friend married to a present

732
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:17,216
Oh hello little okay

733
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
After married got some hard news

734
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,592
She went out and got her a hamster

735
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Sugar Puffs

736
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Sugarfoot

737
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
You should get the cheer her up

738

Wow they're really bright

749
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,104
Does that mean she takes care of her best friend Mary do you know when I was there she was constantly getting up

750
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640

Yeah

789
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
Music ID

790
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
For me

791
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
What

792
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
Downs me the most is like

793
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,768
The way that you're Genesis talk it's always about the good of society saving the race saving the nation

794
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,608
Obsession with the future and with perfection a master race

795
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
They say that it's

796
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Science

797
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,056
That if you just look if you read Darwin and you apply his principles this is how we make a better race

798
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
But the thing that like they all

799
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Somehow happened to miss

800
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
In On the Origin of Species

801
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
Is

802
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
How

803
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Frequently

804
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
Darwin talks about 1

805
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
Sing this one ingredient

806
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,304
That he marveled that he doesn't understand why it's there

807
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,376
But it is the thing to which we all

808
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
Oh

809
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Our existence on Earth what is that one ingredient

810
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Variation

811
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Variation

812
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
It is the engine

813
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,504
Of natural selection of of beings being created more perfectly it when it is what

814
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
You know when a gene pool is

815
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:49,184
Two homogeneous it's weaker and so the Genesis by breeding out

816
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Variation

817
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,280
We're in a way for oiling their very own plot

818
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Building a master race

819
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah

820
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
Like who gets to say what we need

821
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
You know

822
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Does the humidity built into it

823
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
The theory of nature

824
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Selection

825
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Yes it is immediately

826
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,104
Immediately distorted with social Darwinism

827
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Rightly but we decide

828
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Exactly and I think that often times

829
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,784
The story seems like it's past tense like it's over

830
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
But that hubris is

831
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Still

832
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,696
In our laws today I mean I talked earlier about those laws which are

833
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,512
Supposedly different from the eugenic sterilization laws

834
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
The laws

835
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
Where you're allowed to stare like someone in their best interest

836
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Does

837
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
Statutes are so controversial

838
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:36,288
As Paul Lombardo explains when you really dig down into the language these laws are still saying

839
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,360
There are sometimes when we should be making the decision

840
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
For someone else

841
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
About whether or not

842
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
They should have children

843
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,576
I think your inclination is correct there are reports of abuse and there certainly are opportunities

844
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
For abuse in this case

845
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,928
These are powers of the state which we should

846
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
Which way should be incredibly

847
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Suspicious of

848
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,080
Hey this is Pat I did I just want to jump in quick

849
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
I have

850
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
Personal this destroys so intense

851
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:19,040
But I guess I just kind of one question at the end of that about that last thing you're talking about Lulu

852
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Yeah

853
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
So so they're these

854
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
These laws that are different

855
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
The new eugenics

856
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
Sterilization laws bat

857
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
I guess still allow for

858
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
Involuntary sterilization like

859
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Buy a parent or Guardian

860
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
I guess I just wanted like to have you heard of that

861
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,336
Yeah I know I talked to parents I talked to parents

862
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,152
Do parents actually who are struggling with this

863
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Right now

864
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,552
Are you talk to a mom who has a son with severe disabilities and

865
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
Approaching adulthood

866
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
I'm she's like watching him

867
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,952
Piano grow into a man's body with men

868
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
Desires and thinking about sex

869
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,584
And she's like worried that he would

870
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Get someone pregnant

871
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
Beyond wearing that like

872
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,496
She doesn't think there'd be any way he'd be able to care for a kid

873
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,360
I'm so in her mind she has entertain the thought like would he

874
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Audrey be able to live a freer life

875
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,808
If you could have sex and have romantic relationships without the worry

876
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Of getting

877
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
Somebody pregnant

878
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Yeah

879
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,464
Yeah widget that is just like a

880
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
An impossibly

881
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
Difficult place to

882
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Sitting as a parent

883
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Yeah I think

884
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
That there are

885
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,496
Parents family members grappling with this question in a really private

886
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
Hardway like

887
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Is there some wine

888
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408
Where someone is so severely disabled they should not be allowed to

889
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Kids

890
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,528
Okay so no type of situations

891
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:00,160
This is Ivan Nova Smith the historian and disabilities Advocate we heard from before

892
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
When I talked to her about this she says that when it comes to looking for that line

893
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
I think it's really dangerous

894
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Cuz that line moves

895
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
And so

896
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Alvin. Lying

897
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Is it

898
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,336
I get what you're saying that the needs to be aligned and needs to be

899
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Some point

900
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
But

901
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
At the same time

902
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,968
My fear in

903
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
Meaning of people in the disability community

904
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Is that

905
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,136
Is ABBA today and it it all depends on like

906
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,232
The policy is in a politics in the couch deciding where that line is a

907
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,280
Parent Guardian someone appointed by the

908
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:42,400
All of that is scary for us I guess for the disability community

909
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,984
It's scary to talk about the line because

910
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,288
That means we have to leave somebody out

911
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,128
Ivanova says if she had been born in a different time or even

912
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
Slightly different circumstances

913
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
She would have been love

914
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,551
If I had not been adopted I would have been way below that lot

915
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
Wow so where did you go where were you in order

916
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
I was

917
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,183
In Soviet occupied last

918
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Pheaa

919
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
I was born with

920
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
Club feet

921
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
In both of my feet

922
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,655
And they diagnosed me with my developmental disabilities

923
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
And they diagnosed me with autism in

924
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
I never learn my native language

925
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,151
Because the the orphanage was never able to teach me in my native language

926
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
And I'm living the word from you weren't speaking

927
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
At all I want I was ovulating when I 5 and 1/2

928
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,135
And soon after that she was adopted by an American couple I can't walk

929
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Statistics

930
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
And

931
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Eventually learn to talk

932
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
Went to school which could be

933
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:46,399
Difficult because she put that she had a very visible disability

934
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,727
Does she be sitting there in her chair moving her body back and forth

935
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,031
Ways up my movement solids

936
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
Kind of

937
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:57,663
Awkward had learning disabilities

938
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
I have a hard time

939
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,319
Regulating my emotions sometimes she have little Outburst break down in tears so sometimes I need lights.

940
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Supporting

941
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
She kept going

942
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
School eventually started dating

943
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
We dated

944
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,303
For ten years before we got married and then

945
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,679
I had no idea that that one Valentine's Day that we

946
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
Decided not to use a condom

947
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
In 2017 she got pregnant

948
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
And she was terrified

949
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
Dilaudid my prayers

950
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
Well-liked

951
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
Shouldn't have kids in

952
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,087
Her whole life basically people have been telling her like you can't be a mother you would be dangerous

953
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,391
And she had started to believe that I agree

954
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
She worried about all these things

955
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
Yeah like I wouldn't like I would forget to feed them

956
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
All like

957
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
I have depth perception issues

958
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,935
I feel the songs like afraid that I would like Trump over them

959
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
All like

960
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Drop them

961
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,055
And worse than that I don't understand other people's emotions

962
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
SOI

963
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,151
Mascara that I would not have that nurturing

964
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,967
Feeling like she look at the baby and just filled

965
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Suffused

966
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Nothing

967
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,135
Phone number calling my mom when I found out that you know I was pregnant

968
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
I told my mom I was

969
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,719
Scared but my mom was like

970
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
I'll be here for you in

971
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,399
We're going to get through this and this is going to be a minister we are so excited like they was so excited

972
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
When I first went to the doctor to confirm the pregnancy test there was a nurse trying to give me paperwork

973
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
About the abortion pill

974
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
And I said it to them then

975
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
It looks like human being inside me

976
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,855
I'm going to do my best to love them I'm scared to death I'm terrified

977
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,719
But I'm going to do the best I can and I didn't stop really enjoying it

978
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,279
Until she came out of me

979
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
As I put it on me

980
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,935
Little tiny little thing looks little peanut

981
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,799
She has the biggest eyes like I usually cannot look at people in the eyes

982
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
Butthole eyes which is so big

983
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Assume

984
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Why I'd at me

985
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
And

986
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Have

987
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
I just

988
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
I like all of those like Natural Instincts I think it is

989
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Came up once

990
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
I knew what to do

991
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,375
Go to cuddle her and snuggles snuggles

992
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
She doesn't care that Iraq and see the care that I talk to myself seats at the happy little snow

993
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,359
Not going to see loves me unconditionally and

994
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
I love hun

995
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,455
I think she's made me a better person

996
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
Creating that little human

997
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,087
It was the most amazing moment of my life

998
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
She's just such a blessing

999
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,975
You know I can't imagine life without that little girl

1000
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511

00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,071

It would have been for my best interests have been sterilized

1004

1005
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
