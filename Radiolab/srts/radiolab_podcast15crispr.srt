1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
This is Radiolab on Jedi camera

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
There is no leaks by DIY got

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Custard with this

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:29,184
You were some kind of an affair to tell you how I was at a party party

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,232
It was a it was a

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,328
Conference were there a lot of different people with different disciplines come together

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
You know one of those

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,216
Are panel discussions various things as we were at one of those functions

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
And

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,824
It was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was

14
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,664
A lot of booze being serious everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,224
So I was standing there with some violin

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Are the other fun ones

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
The jump Palace

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
My people fairly and they they started to lose their ship

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,232
Like genuinely lose their s***

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
About this thing called

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
And like I've never seen scientist this

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Excited about anything I was like what is this

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
What is crispr

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
Trying to explain to me what they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,592
I gathered it had something to do with genetics and then at one point one of the biologist tournament is like

26
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
I'll tell you what it is

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
I can use crispr to take a little dog

28
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:28,576
And poof make it to a big dog give me a Chihuahua I could turn it into the size of a Great Dane and was like no you can't

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,672
He's like yes I can I could do it with crispr I was like what the hell is this thing

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
To sit here is you

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
I will get up

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,608
No no no no

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl Zimmer

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
Because I just figured for this kind of thing

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
The car thing I got to talk to Carl

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
So I guess I'm like why all the fuss

37
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
Maybe it was just the alcohol or but maybe there's something really happening here

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,576
Oh there's something totally happening there I mean it's

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
He started at the begin

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
So that

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
You you can actually find like the

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
The first reference

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Spur in a 1987 paper

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
And some Japanese scientist

45
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
They basically

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
Describe something weird and E coli and they said we don't know what this is

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
E.coli are bacteria inside human

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
And like all living things

49
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,944
Equalize made up of DNA and T's and C's Angie's and what happened was it the scientist

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
Breeding a chunk of that genetic code

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
When

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
They found this really strange

53
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Stretch of DNA

54
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
Stretch out well so basically what it was

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
5 identical sequences

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
In a row

57
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
And then they were separated by very short

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Sequences in between them that were

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
All different from each other

60
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,128
The little blurb should be like

61
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
And they look at that sound like what

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,856
But this is nothing like we've seen before repeated

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
Sequences in bacterial genomes are kind of unusual

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,792
Seems very strange some biologists felt that there must be a purpose

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,656
Among those purple sneakers Jennifer doudna University of California Berkeley cell biology

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,752
Yeah so it's not dude it's down used to be called the dude

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,616
Sometimes it's cool in the movie she will be played by Jeff

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Right anyhow

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Xango's on scientist are single repeat Loop repeats

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Everywhere

71
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,112
Releasing bacteria lots and lots of lots of species of bacteria

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,000
They say okay wait a minute it's kind of cool your findings it so often

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
Is this where the name Christopher comes from

74
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
The full official name is

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Clustered

76
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
Regularly interspaced

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Short

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Palindromic repeats

79
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
My God, I don't know why they called it

80
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
It's kind of a

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Furniture

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
It sounds like an app

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
But now

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Scientist had the puzzle

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,856
If nature at this level preserve something intact

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Here and here

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
And here and here and here and here

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
And some of these here

89
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Creatures that have been around for

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
Hundreds of millions of years you figure out

91
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Whatever this is

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Doing something

93
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
But what it doesn't take very long

94
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
Before the first big clue

95
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Comes up

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Pirate password

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,175
2005 now scientist have these big searchable databases

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Of DNA sequences are some scientists

99
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Bank elasticsearch

100
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,623
Let's see if these repeating patterns we keep finding match anything else

101
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
It's out there in the world

102
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
And

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
The scientist guitar

104
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
Using computers to just line up these stretches of DNA with thousands upon thousands of different species and then

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Click

106
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
I'm sudden

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Discover

108
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
Did those bits of DNA between the repeats

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Stuck in the Middle does blurt

110
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
These

111
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Are matching virus DNA

112
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
Like you can find viruses

113
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
With

114
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Jeanswear

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
The little you know these little to the bacteria had virus inside of them

116
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
Is that what that mean that it was a virus brought it

117
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
Into this the first recognition was

118
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
This is virus DNA

119
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Somehow all these bacteria

120
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
A little snippet the virus DNA

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
West Indies

122
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Particular places

123
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Energy no

124
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Which is a little weird if you think about that means are totally different creatures

125
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
It would be like inside a human finding a little bit of mosquito DNA

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
How do we interpret this well

127
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
Actually there was one scientist named Eugene koonin

128
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
To look at these results and just had

129
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Okay I guess

130
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Is it offensive

131
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,887
Why would you think that cuz he's a brilliant man I went to her if I went to a large

132
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Sanitation dump

133
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
And I found a teeny bit of

134
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,055
Human hair why would I think

135
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
I wouldn't know it just like a beauty human

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Well you see

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
That metaphor my

138
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Sort of betray at your lack

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
Skill in microbiology I'm just saying like this is not a dump all right this is

140
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Bacteria are not going to just

141
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Let virus DNA

142
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Get into their jeans willy-nilly

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Okay remember

144
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
Viruses are the big anime

145
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
If your bacteria

146
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Viruses make your life a nightmare

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
Think about in the ocean okay the the ocean is

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Full of viruses and end

149
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
Viruses kill up to 40%

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Of all of those bacteria

151
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Everyday

152
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Everyday

153
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Yeah

154
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
And

155
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
We know that they have defenses

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
When Eugene koonin said was

157
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Okay

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
I'm going to bet that

159
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
These bacteria

160
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
Are somehow grabbing pieces of DNA

161
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
From viruses

162
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
And then they're storing it

163
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,959
And now they have a way of recognizing those viruses of

164
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
They come in later

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
Polaroid shots of the enemy

166
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
Write know thy enemy

Poster

168
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
What do you call the mugshot

169
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
This is Eugene koonin leader of the evolutionary genomics group at the national Center for biotechnology

170
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Information

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
He's the guy that called reference to

172
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,279
Stunk up the whole idea that maybe these bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria

173
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Is the bacteria trying to defend itself

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
But but really if I if I if I

175
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
If I could eat myself anything

176
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
It was not so much kissing

177
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Because you know

178
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823

Figuring

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
How the mechanism of likely to be

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
So can you

183
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
Walk us through

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
How the mechanism is likely to work

185
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
All right

186
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
What happens if

187
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
You know when the virus comes in

188
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279

00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
I just kind of

191
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
Explodes in Skyrim releases naked jeans basically

192
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,823
If you're this bacteria these things might take over yourself you've got to respond

193
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
You can multiple

194
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Weapons of Defense

195
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,503
If you've never seen this virus before using the first thing you do says Eugene as you send out these enzymes

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,343
Pack the viruses they're sort of like the ground troops

197
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
And they fight really hard

198
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,303
But much of the time

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
Date fail and then nobody else you are here about

200
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
You're not terribly sophisticated fighter so very often

201
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Taurus takes over

202
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Bacteria die

203
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Bought

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
But there is some

205
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Nonzero probability

206
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,319
Did you actually survive at

207
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,183
If you do then with the bacterial do with sending some new enzymes to basically cleanup

208
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
Go out find any stray viruses.

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
The enemy DNA into

210
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Beautiful small piece

211
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
And here he says when you get to the storage part

212
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
Does enzymes women take those little bits of virus and shove them into the bacteria's own DNA

213
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
Right in those little spaces between the reef

214
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Right there and nobody else

215
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
So I use those spaces in my own DNA as a storage facility

216
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
You use a different memory device

217
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Cuz here's what happened

218
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Next time that virus shows up

219
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Express jeans everywhere now

220
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
You are prepared

221
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
This is where the crisper really gets going

222
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
Cuz instead of sending out the ground troops were probably going to get their asses beat now you can actually send out the big

223
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Guns

224
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
In fact with the cell does it will manufacture these

225
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
Special molecular assassins

226
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
And we'll give those assassin a copy

227
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,559
Of that little bit of virus DNA it hasn't storage spaces thing here take this mugshot

228
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
If you see anything that matches this pattern

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Chilling

230
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
And these attackers do we know what they look but one of them looks like

231
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
Actually looks I would describe it a little bit like a clamshell

232
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
Turn imagine Pac-Man become misshapen and rough

233
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Which one of these guys

234
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
What it has is

235
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
A copy

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
That virus DNA

237
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
It's got the mugshot that is kind of waving around

238
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
What then happens is that whenever the Pac-Man bumps into some virus DNA it pulls apart

239
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
The DNA

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Unzips it

241
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Read it

242
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
It's not the right one goes on

243
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Nope

244
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
And if that RNA has the same sequence then

245
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,183
Digital locks in the DNA is trapped

246
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
And molecular blades

247
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Come out and shop

248
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
So this is smart scissors to it's like you're like the thing I got

249
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Snip

250
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
All right now we're going to kill

251
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
It has to be exact has to be an exact match

252
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
When scientist first discovered this whole system

253
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
They're fascinated they were like

254
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Still working it out there like I'm okay then

255
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
What happens when this happens at 7

256
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Cool

257
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
But then

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
In walks the dude Jennifer doudna with a crazy idea

259
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
What are the crazy radical this could be an amazing technology

260
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
This is a tool right this is a tool that we can use to cut DNA

261
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Where we want to cut DNA

262
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Her basic thought was when we turn this defense

263
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Into office

264
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
These things they seem to be really good at cutting

265
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Give me the only thing to cut the things that are on their mugs

266
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
So

267
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,279
Maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshots instead of them going after viruses

268
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
Maybe they could go after a gene that causes

269
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Huntingdon

270
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Disease or haemophilia

271
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,775
For example a mouse with something like haemophilia

272
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
This is a diseases caused by one bad Gene

273
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
So it is you take seasonal surgeon to give them the mugshot for the badge then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot in Emmaus

274
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Can you set it loose

275
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Just like this program to

276
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Find that Jean and

277
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
The scissors will end up

278
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Cutting exactly

279
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Virginia wanted

280
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
The bad genes gone

281
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Now the question is how do you put in the good G

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Right right

283
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
It turns out actually going to Jennifer doudna

284
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Actually not as hard as you would think

285
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
Really yeah apparently what you do is just

286
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
Throw this new good Jean

287
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Kind of in the neighborhood

288
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Where they will genius

289
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Just in the general vicinity you don't have to get super-precise and it turns out that you know there are repair enzymes that are

290
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
Probably continually

291
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Surveying and checking for brakes

292
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
She says will happen is it inside the cell

293
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Is repair Crews

294
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Come along to see the break

295
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
The CD good Jean just sitting there next to the break to be like all right

296
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,847
I'll just take it in with the pretty guy in this space

297
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,967
So so we take advantage of a natural repair pathway that cells have

298
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
Dietrich both the Cutters and the Fig

299
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Yeah now we're not assassinating anymore

300
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
Now we're actually

301
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Engineering

302
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Oregon from killing to refashioning

303
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
Designing jeans doing genetic

304
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Form of genetic engineering for

305
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
30 years yes but

306
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Not like

307
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Genome editing technologies have been around for a long time but none of them have been as powerful as crispr is

308
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,303
That's Beth Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz she was actually one of the biologists that I

309
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,935
Drunkenly talk to it that thing Modern Art Museum I can't even really remember it

310
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,543
What's the evening setting be so vague

311
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Back in the day

312
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
This is just like two years ago you would have these jeanatta things you would take one put in a cell and what happened before was

313
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
You would give it

314
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
Some instructions about where to go

315
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
And it might go there

316
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
But Michael did somewhere that's a kind of related to where that was

317
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Ridiculous

318
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
Not only would it take left Staten Island did not find there but it would have cost you a fortune and taking up 6 months of your time to get that thing

319
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
You know it's really easy to just give it that mugshot

320
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
And it goes I'm going to find that guy exactly

321
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
It seems to be pretty precise

322
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
And it's

323
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,783
Cheap like the old tools would set you back about five grand to use them once crispr

324
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
The 75 bucks

325
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
And here's the kicker says Carl it seems

326
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
At the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria

327
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Stickman to almost any other creature

328
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
It still works you can use the same crispr system

329
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Can you like do it if

330
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Hornets

331
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,567
Vulnerable in anything I have not I'm waiting for someone to say

332
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Crispr doesn't work in species

333
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
And I have not heard of that

334
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
So basically what you have for the first time in science

335
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Is Gene editing technology that is

336
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Is cheap

337
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Precise

338
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Possible universe

339
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Jennifer doudna says the moment

340
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Full impact of that

341
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Landed on ER

342
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,071
I really I literally had you know the hairs on the back of my neck worse in

343
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
Just processing the fact that this thing exists

344
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
You know that you could actually

345
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Program it

346
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
To cut DNA and

347
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Just like this

348
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,503
Molecular scissors and I can just program it cuts DNA where everyone

349
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
It is amazing

350
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Unless

351
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Think about it

352
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Further

353
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Which we will doing just

354
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
I feel a cloud coming in over there

355
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
Don't you see I see you

356
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Over there but will be right

357
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Hi this is Lauren from Atlanta Georgia Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

358
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,783
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

359
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,647
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

360
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,511
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

361
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,631
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

362
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
And I request

363
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:17,311
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

364
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times

365
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
So did something

366
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

367
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

368
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

369
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,495
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

370
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

371
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,735
Don't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

372
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

373
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Record short audio message for us

374
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

375
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Thank you so much

376
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
Is Radiolab on get up and run

377
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Okay so

378
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
Clearly the possibilities are there to use crispr

379
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Tree diseases

380
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
What if you could

381
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
Get a little more fanciful

382
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,903
Write like what if you can actually go back in time and resurrect long-lost creature

383
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,767
Is talked about a lot we Could reconstruct using a computer

384
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,887
What did genome sequence of the ancestor of all birds was and that would have been

385
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Kind of dinosaur

386
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
Anime could use crispr to turn the chicken into that thing

387
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
For what if you could take an elephant

388
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
And

389
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Snip snip snip

390
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,431
Gradually turn it into his long-lost relative

391
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
The woolly mammoth

392
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Cuz they're related

393
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,391
But if they're there but if you know the woolly mammoth Gina which they do cuz they

394
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Play Family Guy.

395
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Awesome boner some hair

396
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Then you could

397
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,559
Compare the number of differences use crispr to crispr out

398
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
The different parts of the elephant and put in woolly mammoth

399
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
If you can infect go backwards in Thai

400
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,287
Time and make changes in obviously I think you can go the other way to item mean

401
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Humans are

402
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Good design word designing animals

403
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
So if

404
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
It doesn't seem to me to be a

405
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
Crazy notion to imagine parents all over the world

406
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,159
Taller children so silencing the short jeans and favoring the taller jeans

407
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Getting rid of wheat

408
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
Muscles and going for stronger ones

409
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
And on and on and on

410
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
And I don't know where the designing stop

411
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
We sorta got into all of this with a

412
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Carl Zimmer

413
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
If

414
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
If you can

415
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
Be very very jeans

416
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
Specific and you learn more and more about genes over time

417
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Why couldn't you invent

418
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Why couldn't you make a

419
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,599
Pig with wings you you might one day get supposed to get enough to do that there's no Wing in pig lab

420
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,975
You know the best you can hope for right now is a woolly mammoth lab and that's down the hall from where the

421
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Where the the

422
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
The real action is is it now there's a hall and at the end of the phone

423
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,239
It may be 20 years from now but that's what you looking at

424
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
Well yeah I think but the thing is

425
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
Well because you can't make weight

426
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Baby Winnie the Pooh

427
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Just because it's her evolutionary barrier

428
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:44,671
Okay

429
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
Okay I don't think that we need

430
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Federal

431
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,911
Department of Homeland Security I think we're okay there all right

432
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
But we do need

433
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Is like

434
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
We do need to like figure out what are we going to do about

435
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Crispr

436
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
I mean they're going to be using crispr for cancer

437
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
Okay I'm going to take me to take people's immune cells out of their body

438
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Unable to use crispr

439
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,855
To basically allow them to make proteins going to be able to

440
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Grab onto cancer cell

441
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
And attack their own cancer

442
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,096
What animal are you for that is your you're

443
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Uart Inc

444
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
You are tinkering with someone's own body

445
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
You are altering their own

446
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Sal's

447
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Dude

448
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Where do I

449
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
It's just I can't even with this is

450
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
Meet I don't know if it's a religious thought or just

451
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
The thought of Atkins

452
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Conservative person

453
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Coming up in the

454
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
In the test tube baby error

455
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
I now know many wonderful

456
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Adult farmer liter

457
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Test tube babies

458
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
I remember being astonished

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Set

460
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Knows I can't

461
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
I don't know where the sacred begins and ends anymore

462
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
I'm not particular.

463
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
I guess what I'm instead on is I'm on

464
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
On

465
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
A hobbesian view of human beings are there

466
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
Something about human beings including scientist

467
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Volume means

468
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
There is there's a darkness and a light beer

469
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
There is an Angelic side to Being Human on his

470
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Very very

471
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Difficult synonym

472
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
The human beings get more and more

473
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Create an

474
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Zayn and

475
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Essentially

476
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Creative

477
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Future

478
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,376
The future will include the imaginations both like

479
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
End.

480
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Humans

481
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
And that would be new in the world

482
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
I don't think it is new because if you go back to the start of the Scientific Revolution some like Francis Bacon would say explicitly like

483
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Science

484
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Is

485
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,248
Going to be both about learning about how the world works

486
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
And

487
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Using that knowledge

488
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
How to control it

489
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,368
This has been discovered this is been published

490
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
Everybody knows it

491
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
If you if you can send it okay now we're going to all we're going to outlaw.

492
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
I'm not the same testing

493
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
What what are you suggesting we should

494
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
Cringe Lewis A123

495
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,896
What do we do now I don't know we all come

496
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
If that's what you are you cringe

497
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
You Chris

498
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
Shoe creams with attitude

499
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,976
Dial Beijing with with dragons

500
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
You're saying

501
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
You're saying oh my God

502
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
Forget to that conversation with Carl was 4 months ago

503
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
And a lot has happened in the

504
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,176
And that time because of the question that you asked like where does the sacred begin and end with one of the lines that have been drawn

505
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
By Jennifer doudna and others was that we should not

506
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:55,904
Use the technology on humans who haven't been born yet meaning not on sperm cells or egg cells

507
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,256
Because if you crispr say an embryo not that is it that is a permanent change

508
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
Right that is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children

509
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:09,216
And their children's children and their children's children's children you can't ask

510
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
The

511
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
Person if that's okay

512
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
Because you're doing it before they're born

513
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Send

514
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Becomes a real issue

515
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
Imagine making these changes

516
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
Is and a cat

517
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,016
Skate through generation after generation

518
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
You could affect the evolution of organisms

519
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
And it's

520
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
I want to say trivial but it's you know it's fairly easy to do it

521
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
Wow kind of profound I feel it's really profound

522
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Profound but it was just an idea

523
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
That is until for the first time in history researchers in China have successfully edit the human genome in it

524
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
Embryo just two months ago

525
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,640
It was announced that a Chinese team used a technique called crispr

526
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
To edit DNA in human embryos

527
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
Now these embryos the Chinese team if they were created through IVF and they were not viable embryos

528
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
Are not going to actually develop into a person so they're they're going to be discarded anyway I can figure it out with those

529
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
Embryos what's the stop anyone from going further

530
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
Physicians that they crossed an ethical line

531
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
Just sort of thing could be sort of a slippery slope towards

532
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay

533
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Now that the Grinch party is

534
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
It's bread and Robertsons cement

535
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,560
We called up Carl again we have to revisit we have to revisit because in our Armageddon conversation

536
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
Getting which I believe I was extremely alarmist and you were extremely down putting I feel that I should do a small

537
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Small little parade

538
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
Kobe

539
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:54,176
Remember the Alamo remember remember China

540
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:59,808
And you have to close you should just begin anytime you want like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are going to start from there

541
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
I'm sorry so are we actually surrounded by an army of clones with soup

542
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Super powers

543
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,376
Yeah but I think the Dyke has been opened I believe I'm going to quote somebody who said

544
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,264
Maybe a few weeks ago I think he went maybe was last week even writing for naturally

545
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
I think it was maybe with somebody named Carl

546
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,664
Who said that the news from China and that news

547
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Could probably

548
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
The beginning of an entire New Era and I think I said it was a historical moment

549
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
And I and I still stand by that

550
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,928
Do you feel differently now than the first time we talked

551
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
I don't feel

552
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
Different actually because

553
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
Didn't really know

554
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Scientifics

555
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Surprise here

556
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
He says people been doing all these crispr experiments and all these different mammals

557
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
We're mammals this is bound to have

558
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
In fact it may be happening more than we think

559
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,664
One account in the journal Nature has said that for other Chinese labs

560
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
They're doing this kind of work

561
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Carlyle Soto

562
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
Which she said was unsurprising to buttocks

563
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,136
Surprising that the crispr work this Chinese team did

564
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
Didn't work very well

565
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Kind of

566
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
I mean in only a few of the cases

567
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Did they

568
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Really get

569
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Exactly what they want

570
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,288
They tried using crispr in about 86 embryos and they only got to work right and maybe 28

571
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
A lot of them Christmas made the wrong cuts and screwed up the cells and that led them to conclude that this is a technology that's not

572
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Not ready right now

573
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Replication in the human germline

574
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
And

575
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
I agree

576
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
We still are in this kind of fortunate position where we can say oh well it's dangerous

577
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
So we shouldn't

578
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
Use it

579
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
I am human embryos

580
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,216
I just don't think that we're going to be able to certify find Refuge there in like 10 or 20 years

581
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Dinner 20 years you know christopher wilby

582
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
So sophisticated

583
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
The people will be able to say

584
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
I can get you

585
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
The change you want

586
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
And I can do it safely

587
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,808
I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos that have

588
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
The alteration in the

589
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Particular Gene Yuan

590
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
So then what

591
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,280
Is that Jennifer doudna told us that this experiment similar experiments have been repeated in mice

592
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
With more advanced crispr systems cuz apparently there

593
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,192
And there it was done with almost no error

594
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,568
Sometimes I feel like we're certain displacing or ethical concerns on to

595
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Something that hasn't happened yet

596
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:37,248
We really are concerned about what we're doing to the human gene pool you know it's already here

597
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Take as an example in vitro fertilization

598
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
About 60000 kids are born a year through IVF and it

599
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Probable that

600
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Some of those

601
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,840
Parents chose what they wanted a boy or a girl and when people start doing IVF there was a huge controversy

602
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
See people said this was dangerous

603
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
This is unnatural

604
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
I don't see

605
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Peoples

606
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
Who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of IVF

607
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,128
Now I'm going to sound like I'm on Roberts out of this I mean okay so

608
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,784
So I don't hurt okay alright okay

609
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,416
So you guys know about all the stuff going on Iceland where they're looking

610
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
DNA and you know they're looking for

611
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Disease genes and so on

612
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
And

613
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
When they're looking at these Icelandic people they found that some people

614
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,216
Had a gene that

615
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Text them

616
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Against Alzheimer

617
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
President reduces our odds of getting also

618
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
Let's imagine your doctor said no if you'd like

619
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
For an extra $1,000

620
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,528
We will take these IVF embryos and we will

621
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Use crispr

622
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
To give them the Alzheimer

623
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Protecting

624
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Variant

625
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,512
Would you like that you want to add that to your to your procedure

626
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Or would you like your child to

627
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632

628
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Teacher of of

629
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Alzheimer's

630
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Your choice

631
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,288
Teachers might here's my thing here is anything with this whole this whole thing

632
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,616
I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said which is that

633
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
When it's not dangerous anymore

634
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
What will we do and I'm afraid we've already answered

635
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
That question

636
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
It's not it's not a

637
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
Question that's open NE

638
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
Because if we're already doing this kind of

639
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
Stuff and who's going to say no to that

640
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Who's going to say no to that

641
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,536
Yeah we've already answered the question

642
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Yeah

643
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
We may have

644
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
