1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,552
Hi I'm Robert krulwich I Molly Webster Radiolab and today

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,648
We've got breaking news Robert krulwich

5
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,512
Drake this is something we've never done before never done before what does anybody know about this yet

6
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,840
Well it is a new bit of research is being published today

7
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
We've known about it for the last few months

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
But we haven't been able to talk about it

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
What's this thing about

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
So is this is a discovery about Alzheimer's

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Disease

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
Which I think at this point is something that affects

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
Basically every family

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
Affected my family

15
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
And this is

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,576
A discovery that is not a cure but it's

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
Basically about looking at the brain

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Which is one of the most complicated things in the universe I thing

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
And poking at it in this super simple way

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
And getting

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
Desposar results

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
How is your car

23
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Pretty bizarre

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Hello

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Hello hello

26
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
Hi Molly hi how are you alright so last night I was talking to some folks over at the brain Institute at M

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:28,576
A mighty and while I was on the phone with them they started telling me about some research that had been published

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
It was all very

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Oshkosh

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Be cool though we ended up

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Defining to sign a non-disclosure agreement

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,792
And it was based on the work of this woman Lee Wei Tile

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
The weight I sigh

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
Ty I'm a professor and the director of The picower Institute for learning am I

35
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Memory at MIT

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Holy crap you're a director

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,968
How do you have time to do all that that's a good question she is like a badass is what she is

38
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
Buy this is the piece of work and I'm very proud of

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
I'm very excited about

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay cool so Amy's eliminate let me begin okay so historically people work on Alzheimer's

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Really

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,632
I would say generally when you talk to researchers about Alzheimer's disease

43
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,496
They either focus on individual genetic factors

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
The genetics of the disease so that

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Jeans that

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:26,432
Predispose you maybe to alzheimer's the brain chemistry and how Alzheimer's affects

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Chemicals in the brain molecular

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
Pathological features do my conversation with leeway

49
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,696
She was talking about something totally different sort of look at it from a different angle

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,256
Ignore work all centers around something called

51
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
The gamma frequency

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
The gamma gamma and what is Battlestar

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
I don't think it's that

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
You could think of it as a particular

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Beat

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
In your brain

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
A beat in the brain

58
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah which means what exactly

59
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Well just to oversimplify one of the most complicated things in the known universe

60
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Got your brain

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Full of neurons which are a certain type of brain cells we have

62
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
Billions of neurons in the brain they have you

63
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
Long tentacles that are reaching out

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Towards other neurons

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
And for the brain to function neurons have to communicate with each other to process information and the way

66
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Way they do that is

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
They fire

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Yes

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,064
An electrical signal will go through them in a like that

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Another neuron it'll turn it on and then it'll like an electrical signal will go through it and then

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,816
Turn it on but the cool thing is is that when your brain is doing things like making you move

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Write a poem or think great thoughts

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
Groups of neurons fire in sync all together on the same

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Beat

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
And there's a bunch of different Pizza happen in the brain

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
Some of them are slow like one beat per second and that's

77
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
When you're sleeping

78
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
If you're beating around 10 beats per second like maybe you're sitting next to a campfire in an Adirondack chair

79
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Chair

80
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Or unless I totally other end of the spectrum

81
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Like some neurons fire at 600 Beats

82
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Per second or do they do or die that I have no idea. All this is going on in your head simultaneously yeah

83
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
The cool thing is that when

84
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,287
All of these beats in your brain come together that's when you're able to

85
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
Process the world

86
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
And understand it as it exists

87
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Is human being

88
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
But getting back to our story

89
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
When your brain is doing something really tricky that requires super focused attention working

90
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
Memory and and so on trying to find your way

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,983
Home from the subway station or if you're in a new city you don't navigate around it there's a certain beat

92
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,871
It sort of rises above them all and that is but so cold gamma frequency

93
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
This range between 30 beats per second all the way up to a hundred feet per second and is gamma frequency has been

94
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
Consider to be very important for the higher-order

95
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Cognitive function and the interesting thing is that when you look at an Alzheimer's brain what you see

96
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
There's actually less gamma happening or people say like the power of gamma is reduced

97
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Has can be recruited to oscillate at the gamma frequency it's still there

98
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Quieter

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Thank you turn the volume down right

100
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,783
Isos just a briefly some up here what we've got is a rhythm which we call gamma

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Which is used when we have

102
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Complicated are higher thoughts in the brain

103
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Which one you got Alzheimer's

104
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Kind of gets

105
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Saggy

106
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
So tired of course

107
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
Obviously in an Alzheimer's brain there's a lot going on in this is just one of the things

108
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
Right you got the plaque buildup around the neurons the stuff that

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
Except your brain and makes it hard to think

110
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
The cobwebs in the brain

111
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,199
And then the connections between neurons gets all muddy heated immune cells get messed up but I was like

112
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Forget all that

113
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
What would happen if I just bring the gamma back yeah

114
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
We decided

115
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
To just manipulate

116
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Gamma oscillations

117
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
How do you how do you do that

118
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Well

119
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Hello hello hello hello hello

120
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
Technology hi this is Molly hi hi hi

121
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
Technology you can find at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

122
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,967
And actually I went took a train up to Boston at MIT not too long ago

123
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
It's a

124
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
Big Shiny glass building

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,767
Eventually lose weight I came striding into her office to meet me

126
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
What you want to see

127
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
And Toby way let me down the hall to this tiny room

128
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
Brought in these

129
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,079
Adorable little myself my gosh they're like little black

130
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Can soft and furry

131
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Ears are

132
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Tags little metal tag

133
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
So here's what they did

134
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
I get some ice we started all please a mouse model not the mice I actually got all excited over but my city

135
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
Early stage of Alzheimer's disease

136
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
Swissmar Depot notable defects

137
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Do they have the Donkey

138
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
Black stuff in them yet or is that later but they do have elevated levels of

139
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,775
Peptide switches this protein that forms the plaque

140
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
So it's like basically black gunk

141
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,967
But the important thing to lose weight on your team is that they have less gamma going on in their brain

142
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
If you remember the whole plan here is

143
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
To bring the gamma back yes

144
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
So

145
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
To do that

146
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
They get what might be the worlds

147
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Can I use drill and a drill a small hole

148
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Into the skull of the mouse

149
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,143
And then they take a really thin fiber optic cable they slide it through the hole into the brain

150
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,983
And then they get the Blazer of blue light to flicker

151
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
40 beats per second yeah my frequency and they turn that on in the light travels down the fiber optic cable deep down into the brain

152
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
This group of cells that they modify

153
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
In the hippocampus

154
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
To be sensitive to light

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,367
So when the pulsing light hippie sells they actually began to fire at 40 beats per second

156
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
A gamma frequency

157
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
When our

158
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
Hiring and firing and firing and hiring and firing then

159
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
After 1 hour they turn off the light and then eventually they started looking at the the brains of these mice

160
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Trying to figure out if anything was different

161
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
After the light flash

162
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
And they see

163
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
2 armat surprise

164
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
We're not expecting this at all we found

165
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
After they shop is pulsing light into the brain there was

166
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Suddenly nearly

167
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Half as much

168
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
That soon-to-be nasty black Gunk stuff

169
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
That was filling up

170
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Half of the stuff was just Swept Away yes

171
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,423
40 to 50% reduction of beta-amyloid that just seems

172
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
This is crazy I mean

173
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
We were just so surprised

174
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Do they know why

175
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Why the flu turn out

176
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,967
The pulsing light somehow triggered the brain's clean up crew

177
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
Microglia the cells in the brain that are called microglia you can say they're the janitors of the brain

178
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,207
Normal brain these janitor cells usually gobble up a gum

179
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Spot

180
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
In Alzheimer disease

181
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
It's known that Michael gliadin.

182
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
They don't serve the function normally anymore

183
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
I'd like these janitors just sort of

184
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Stop

185
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Cuttin Up

186
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
And go on strike

187
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Fairy

188
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Okay so we're looking at a screen that's now

189
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,199
Flat it's not not the one I was at a mighty one of leeway is grad students my name is Anthony Moore

190
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Martorell

191
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,111
Boys showing me side-by-side comparisons of the mice brains on the screen

192
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Which

193
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
The green things microglia

194
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,791
And you see after 1 hour

195
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Of gamma wow

196
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
The microglia the cell

197
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Themes

198
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
A lot bigger clearly see these round

199
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Bodies

200
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
And also the belly

201
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Sims will have more amyloid

202
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
Oh like you're doing more eating

203
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
Yes they go back to eat more amyloid again it's like somehow making the neurons fire turned on the

204
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Sanitation system in the brain

205
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
The most

206
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Wild

207
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,839
Results with there's more wild oh my God you got to hear this because what I'm about to tell you

208
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
You may say no I don't believe it it's science fiction

209
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Okay

210
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,543
So one of the things leeway in her team were starting to think was that

211
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
Drilling in fiber optic cable

212
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,663
Very invasive right you never be able to do that on

213
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Human exact

214
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
So we started to say well

215
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
What if we can get the light

216
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Into the brain

217
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
In a different way like maybe

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
We could go through

219
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
The eyes

220
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,535
Tony the hole in your head would be your eyes instead of a hole in your head

221
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
So we way and her team created what I like to think of as

222
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
The flicker room

223
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
What is the real

224
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
This is a room and I visited is just a storage closet you know you have a

225
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
What is this

226
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Just like

227
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
The table fairy DIY it's a plastic table you can buy at Target there was some plastic shoe

228
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Box size containers lined up on the table for the mice

229
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
And then go see the strip

230
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,487
Around the edge of the table basically surrounding all the

231
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Are duct tape

232
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Strips of LED lights

233
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,167
And other reason or use LED this because a regular light bulb

234
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Can't flash fast

235
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Intellij idea is what if we just

236
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Put the mice in this room and just let the light flicker

237
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
At 40 Beats

238
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
4 seconds to show Molly like attorney

239
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Yeah

240
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
And so we turn off the overhead light in the room

241
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
So it's very black and then

242
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
Oh wow

243
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,415
The room was now glowing with this white LED light

244
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Peso the light is

245
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Turning on North

246
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
20 * 2

247
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,559
It is so there's not you not you don't see anything going like on or off

248
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
I just looks like something on but it kind of feels like my

249
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
My eye is twitching

250
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
And so is blurring the the Blurred the Lytle

251
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Just on the edges

252
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,663
On the edges when do they put mice in this room for an hour and just let them kind of Bays

253
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
Bathe in this in this glow and guess what

254
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
What we look at

255
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
The amyloid-beta levels

256
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
In the visual cortex

257
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
And we found

258
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
There is a 50

259
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,351
50% 50%.

260
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Weasley didn't they didn't

261
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
Do any Drilling in their stalls or anything so they didn't have to be sensitive to light

262
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,455
I filled the room with occasional LEDs flashing at a particular frequency for an hour

263
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
Are you going to tell me I don't believe it is

264
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Science fiction

265
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
And they followed the study up with another study which was done in the same way so are the same flicker room light through the eye

266
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,631
Highballs and only this time they put the mice in there for one hour day for 7 days

267
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
And they took my SAT had full-blown Alzheimer

268
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
So this is like

269
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,591
Cognitive decline they're forgetting things and they've got hardened plaques in their brain

270
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
They say the same thing nearly

271
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Half of the stuff

272
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Was cleared away

273
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Half

274
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Flickering light

275
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
In front of them

276
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
That's the shot I mean that's the shocking thing

277
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
The thing I didn't understand after talking to you about your study was I was like

278
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,655
Why hasn't everyone done this before like why didn't everyone go we should just shine light through eyes

279
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Will you know that's

280
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
It's really the most unexpected and exciting as back

281
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Or study

282
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Peaches

283
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Something this simple

284
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Yet

285
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
You know it has never been done before

286
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
One of the things at one of the caveat here

287
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
Is that if you don't do the flicker Lite room every 24 hours a level of gunk in the brain starts going back

288
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
Back up again and so now they're trying to figure out how they

289
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Keep those levels

290
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Down maybe the fur good

291
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
If

292
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
V

293
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
Mouse no longer has quite as much

294
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Junking is he

295
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Does that mean that it can

296
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Remember things that

297
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Happened to it

298
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Yeah that is

299
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
There

300
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
They don't know that's what they're too that is now.

301
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
Next Step but nobody really understands how

302
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,183
Plaques and the gunk buildup in the brain relates to memory and key

303
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Cognition

304
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,559
The Dogma in the field is that when you have Alzheimer's

305
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
You can't form

306
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
New memories and once you lose the memory it's gone for good

307
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,775
But there is another group at MIT that is actually

308
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
Thrift challenging that assumption that

309
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
You can never get a memory back cuz the person could never tell us

310
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
We all assume that the information have to be gone

311
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
All really

312
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
And we'll get to them

313
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
The first day of school

314
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
This is Kevin Murray from Fort Collins Colorado

315
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of Science and

316
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Technology in the modern world

317
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,519
More information about Sloane @www.

318
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Sloan. Org

319
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

320
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
And I'm here because I need your help

321
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,903
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

322
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Aunts and uncles teachers

323
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,767
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Basically I want to hear about this

325
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
Did you know did something

326
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
It just means you lean back and say

327
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Well

328
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month

329
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Started reading

330
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Back to you

331
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

332
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,783
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

333
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Or maybe the kids in math

334
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Taking the margin of their geometry

335
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
We're interested in the

336
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Specific moments where

337
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Kid does something super smart

338
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
It doesn't have anything to do with it

339
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
If you have a story

340
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Go to radiolab.org

341
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Splash brilliant

342
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Record a short audio message

343
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
And that's radiolab.org

344
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Flash Brewing

345
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Thank you so much

346
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
I'm rubber clovece Molly Webster

347
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,863
Is Radiolab more back and just before the break you said that

348
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
There may be a way

349
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
To bring a memory back

350
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Holding me back

351
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Team to be in the play

352
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Yeah

353
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,687
Wide why are we so quick to jump to the conclusion that the information was somehow completely gone

354
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:28,831
And the person who said that to me is this guy

355
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Something else

356
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Over at the town of Growlithe they were thinking

357
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
What if we could figure out eggs

358
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Exactly where the memory should be in the brain

359
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
I just give that spot a little bit of juice

360
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
So they took some ways that were just starting to lose their ability to remember things and they thought okay let's try to give them a memory

361
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Meet them in a box that has a particular smell some sort of lighting and some texture on their feet a little mouse

362
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,783
Carpenter

363
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,647
The point is the Box looks and feels and smells different than any other box they would hang out in

364
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
And then give them a light electrical shock

365
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
And the mice

366
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
They just freeze

367
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
They don't move at all which is a sign that they're afraid

368
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
The Heat

369
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,751
And for the rest of the afternoon which is very long time and mouse time they go on hating the Box

370
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Which means

371
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,335
With the carpet in the light in the smell if you put it back in there it'll

372
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Breeze

373
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Because it remembers

374
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Yes

375
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
But

376
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
Day or week later when the same lights are put back into the same box

377
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Still just continue investigating as if nothing happened

378
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
The cannot remember

379
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,375
So did Raj and his team did with leeway did they got some modified mice and then it put a little hole in their head

380
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Slit in a fight Rock

381
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Optic cable they shine some light

382
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Trick of the neurons if they think

383
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Hold this memory

384
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
And they were

385
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,175
Near the fear section so leading on the path to the fear section

386
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
So we do this

387
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
And then

388
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,343
Put them back into box the box with a particular lighting and smell in carpet

389
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Is there any change in their behavior

390
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Will they act afraid again

391
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Do they show any more memory

392
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
And they did

393
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Shut up if they actually were scared of the boxing

394
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
They showed recovered memory

395
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
Best memories in there

396
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Exactly

397
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Behaviors back

398
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,199
You can dig up the memory by

399
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Shining Light in the right place

400
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Yeah

401
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,183
I was always under the impression that their memories were totally lost

402
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Just do it

403
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Essentially the entire field

404
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,839
That's good because the patient could never tell us

405
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
We all assumed the information have to be gone

406
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,287
So one of the things to say is that deraj did tell me that you know all of this

407
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
The experiments they did are in

408
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Mice that have early Alzheimer's

409
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,551
Are the Saudis so is that once you get to the late stage of the disease there's enough damage in the brain that you really wouldn't be able

410
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
How to get those memories

411
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Is back

412
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
That might

413
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Be right

414
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Other memory loss

415
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Distrust

416
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Lost but you know when you

417
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
When you have someone in your house

418
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
And you are

419
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Can you live with this disease day in and day out

420
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
The disease

421
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Just

422
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Goes its own way and

423
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Puzzleyou or

424
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Writing you or

425
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
I believe the clear something new that you didn't expect

426
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
So for example my dad had it for about

427
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
19 years

428
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Slow

429
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Active disappearing Heat

430
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Wearing the last

431
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Time my father

432
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Team

433
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
2

434
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Was so far into the disease

435
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
He hasn't spoken

436
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
For year-and-a-half

437
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
He was sitting at the table for the Passover Seder

438
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
And there's a song that you saying

439
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
Panagos die die die die

440
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
Dino Dino Dino Dino

441
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Decorous

442
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
End

443
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
From out of nowhere

444
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
This

445
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Being

446
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,280
At the end of the table who I knew was my father who hadn't spoken in a year and a half or two and have not spoken

447
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Coherently

448
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
3

449
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Suddenly

450
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
Blue into the song

451
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
And sang the song

452
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,824
Full-throated lie at the table

453
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Like

454
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
The reappearance of some just last

455
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Figment of himself

456
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
It was both horrifying

457
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
Extraordinary

458
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
The fact that maybe some information still persists hopefully someday we could maybe that's something we could do

459
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
Solo

460
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,616
My mind at the moment

461
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
As long as we can figure out

462
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
How to reboot

463
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,136
The pathway to retrieve the memory then I think there is

464
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
This is the way tie again but

465
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,304
You know I I personally think the most important question is

466
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Whether humans were

467
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Respond

468
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Similarly

469
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
I mean keep in mind that both

470
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Daraja study and leeway ties are in mice not humans

471
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,360
Right so I do have a spot that like why I like

472
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
Is there a reason that a human neuron might react differently than a mouse

473
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,088
The thing is I sing especially you know in all timers field I mean people got burned a lot

474
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
You know there's like I-99

475
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
.6% failure rate in moving something that seemed to work in mice to humans

476
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,632
6 yeah that was a study that came out in 2012

477
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
That's a horrible number

478
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
So

479
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
I just got to be

480
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Julie

481
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:12,384
Conservative while we have in my stitches

482
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,992
So exciting and so unexpected so much fun

483
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
But

484
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
You know I'm going to keep my mind open

485
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
When it comes to Human

486
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,744
The plan is that we're going to find out because they're going straight to Human

487
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
Oh look a new human trial

488
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Will they want to so yeah I guess we'll see

489
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
This is a glorious part of

490
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
This

491
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Oregon

492
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
The main is so crazy complicated with whatever

493
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
100 trillion connections whatever it is

494
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
There's so much

495
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Chance

496
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
There's going to be a lot of surprise

497
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah it's like I almost even if it doesn't lead to any that treatment in humans or

498
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Something

499
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,440
Super concrete it's like we know this little secret about the brain now

500
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
And if something

501
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
That feels

502
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
But beautiful

503
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah I'm actually sitting the stuff for my Christmas

504
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Are you really

505
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
That way I just bought the new LED lights and they can they can fix her a different color

506
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
I was different colors each individual

507
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
Travel through colors but while they're doing that they're going to be flickering at 40

508
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
We going to have a very

509
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Therapeutics

510
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
Christmas household

511
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
This is the tree in your home

512
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Yes

513
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Yes

514
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
I want to have an eggnog next to that tree

515
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
We thank you Molly for free what a remarkable
