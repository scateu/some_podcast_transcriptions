1998

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
On the outskirts of Houston

39
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
There's

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,368
Deputy sheriff named Joseph Quinn around and he hears this

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
Call go out on the radio

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,560
Somebody's called in and said there's a man going crazy with a gun in an apartment

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
She happens to be driving right by

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
Apartment complex

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Pretty familiar with the complex

46
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
I knew where the building was so he's like hey I got this

47
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
I could listen and see if I can do any kind of sound to disturb

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
Walking to the breezeway

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
On high alert has tightened Reynolds pumping

50
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
In-N-Out in the middle Courtyard

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
It was a gentleman standing out there

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Tootsie

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
Xiaomi start yelling over here over here I can tell him I was

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
Upset

55
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
He's up there he's up there I should up where any Place apartment on the second floor

56
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
Is that where you're saying that apartment right there he said yeah

57
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,576
So a couple other officers arrived and they get information

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Control your breathing

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,512
You know their adrenaline watching a blood pressure down the way you don't get tunnel vision

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Went up the stairs

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Wireless

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
When I get up to the top of the stairs

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Got to the apartment door and their door was

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
A jar was open

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
I listen for a second

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
I could detect anything in the apartment

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
So we got ready and I

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
Push the door open all the way open

69
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
Announced our presence Sheriff's Department

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,024
Anyone in apartment come out where we can see you keep your hands in plain sight

71
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
I did just two or three times very loudly

72
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Still no response

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
There's a bedroom in the back of the apartment

74
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
What's a door

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
To a back bedroom

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
It was closed and

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
These

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Two officers start walking towards it open the door

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Is it open

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
As soon as he did

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
People arched back

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Startled

83
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,816
So go to the bedroom

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
You've got to be kidding me

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Really

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
What was it

87
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
What was it

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
It was

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Two guys having

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Something I'll never forget I mean it's like

91
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Dodgers

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Flabbergasted

93
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
Okay so here's the story the two guys that were in the apartment where John Laurens

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
And Tyron Garner

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,815
John was an older white guy he was in his fifties and Tyrone was a younger black guy in his 30s

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,935
Come to find out basically these gentleman downstairs

97
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
Former lover on again off again lover one and he was upset that the other today

98
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
They were engaged in some kind of

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
Okay so the guy in the parking lot was the boyfriend of Tyrone and we don't really know why

100
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
Call 911

101
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
But the thought is that maybe he was jealous of whatever was going on in the apartment and he decided he wanted to get the

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
It was a Lover's triangle kind of thing

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,143
So you know the cops come in and Johnny Tyrone have no idea what's going on they didn't know that

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
The boyfriend had gone and

105
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Call nine-one-one so they're shocked

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
Quinn says they start yelling at him

107
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Just I mean combative

108
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Belligerent

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
I refuse to comply with anything

110
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
We hated gays we were homophobic we were jackbooted not

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
So the starting point

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
When does suicide

113
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,159
We're leaving here in the way you're acting and they're intoxicated we're going to have further calls here

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Yeah it's not again

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
If we leave them here

116
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Recite Surah restaurant

117
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Really what what

118
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
On what charge I mean they're just in their house

119
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
So that's the

120
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
Question

121
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
Coleman for 15 years and

122
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
Blessed with the ability to have someone of what you would call a photographic memory

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Meaning Hindu the penal code really well

124
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
He starts

125
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
Thinking he starts going through all the possible laws

126
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Could apply to this

127
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,343
20 lines on this one

128
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Statute 2106

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
It says that members of the same sex can engage

130
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
It's a law Banning sodomy

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
You get sexual intercourse

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Or not

133
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Even treated like civilized

134
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,799
This is John Laurens from an interview he did with Lambda legal in 2008

135
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
It's one of the few bits of tape that we have

136
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
This is all of a sudden we're taking you downtown

137
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
I wasn't allowed to put clothes on

138
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
I was handcuffed and dragged down stairs

139
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Officer Joe Quinn has a different version of that story

140
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
They refuse so

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
We forced them to put

142
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,887
Some underwear on you know actually tell him down and put underwear on them and escorted them out apartment like that

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
It was a struggle just to get them to put underwear on

144
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,055
It's time for second whatever happened in that room which capital golang

145
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Second

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
This moment

147
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
Two guys supposedly having sex and being charged with sod

148
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
It was like a strike of lightning

149
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
It would begin the process would profoundly

150
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Reshape America

151
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
What's interesting

152
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
This is one of the first things that you bump into if you are an idiot

153
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
About the Wall of China

154
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
And then you try to make a podcast about the law

155
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Is that

156
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,567
There's often disconnect like laws are these things that float above us all these beautiful abstractions

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
And yet if you want to challenge law you've got to find a person

158
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Down here in the mud

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,575
Who's experienced perfectly SoMo captures what you feel is wrong with the law you got to find a perfect plaintiff

160
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,183
How do you find that person what happens if they're not so perfect

161
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,071
These two stories are going to hear about a particular tactic that sometimes called test case litigation

162
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
And I wasn't aware of the for catheter

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
The Second Story actually touches on a current case

164
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Just decided a few days ago

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
Affirmative action will meet the guy

166
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Who brought that case

167
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,967
The critics say it's basically destroying some of the most iconic civil rights law from the 60s

168
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
First

169
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
Get back to Katherine Wells with a story of a case called Lawrence V Texas

170
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Okay

171
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Come on Inn

172
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
I brought out my alarm

173
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
Vs Texas box of

174
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Stop

175
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:07,167
So went to Houston and I visited a guy named Mitchell katine he's a lawyer there

176
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
And

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
He showed me the arrest papers he had the arrest paper

178
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Words for these two guys

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
CJ Lawrence Criminal

180
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Officers observed

181
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
The defendant engaged

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
In deviant sexual

183
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Conduct

184
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Charged with homosexual conduct

185
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
It's right there in writing

186
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
It really is strange to see those words on a piece of paper it seems like such an anachronism but it was not actually

187
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Has dated

188
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
September 17th 1998

189
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Now in 1998

190
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Texas wasn't the only state that had this kind of law on the books

191
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,615
At least 13 other states also had an anti-sodomy law and it's important to note that you know this law wasn't used very

192
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Very much people were not arrested for this law because when would police be present in your home to observe you having

193
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
Jill Carpenter

194
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
International law

195
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
SMU Law School

196
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,951
I mean sodomy laws weren't really about stopping any

197
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Body from having sex

198
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
They were really about ensuring

199
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
That we could label

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
People Criminal

201
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
It was

202
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
A label that

203
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
People could point to

204
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
So the people who disapproved of homosexuality could say

205
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
Looks defining a

206
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Of homosexuality

207
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
A crime

208
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Crime

209
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Can you commit the crime

210
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,831
Well you're a criminal it's a criminal statute people can say your criminal

211
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Which then give the state

212
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,999
Illegal basis to justify all sorts of housing discrimination employment discrimination

213
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Military and every context

214
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Statin effect

215
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
How many people argue that these laws

216
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
They also sent

217
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
A strong cultural message

218
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,359
The most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious

219
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
Killing in this was at a time when hate crimes in Houston word

220
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
Surprisingly comments after being beat with a nail-studded two-by-four

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
2nd senseless killing in the Montrose area in less than three months is a lot of blood and was really apparent that he

222
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Benshot

223
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
To make a long story short was very eager to repeal that sodomy law

224
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
Okay so John and Tyrone were arrested on a Thursday night

225
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
The next day it's so happen

226
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
That

227
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Because of the location of John Lawrence's apartment

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
The case landed in a Justice of the

229
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Peace Court meaning after Quinn made the arrest

230
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
The report was sent to that court for processing

231
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Now this court is

232
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Mostly deals with traffic

233
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
It's mostly a traffic court

234
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
But there happens to be this clerk in the court

235
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Who was

236
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
Gay and it couldn't believe that there that somebody had actually been arrested for homosexual conduct in their home

237
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
Is Clerk and his partner go to a bar start talking to the bartender

238
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
I believe it was a Friday night

239
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
This is Lane Lewis he was the bartender what I was doing

240
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Under nineteen

241
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Who is two guys come in and they tell Lane

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
You're not going to believe what happened

243
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
It's a couple of guys were arrested

244
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
And charged with the sodomy

245
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
And when was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

246
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,815
You just can't believe that such a thing happened it's such an unusual occurrence

247
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
And

248
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Landsat send me the report Monday morning bright and early

249
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
I can hear my fax machine go off

250
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
But in their not pull it off

251
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Officers observed

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
The defendant

253
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Engage in deviance

254
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Anda

255
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
And that's when it hit me

256
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Oh

257
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
I mean it was so clear night and day to me

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
Immediately knew what I had in

259
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
White why does he care so much about

260
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Well so when he wasn't

261
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
Being a bartender Lane was a community organizer

262
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,071
Tickly around LGBT issues I was present of the game has been political

263
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,655
Caucus that's one of the oldest LGBT civil rights groups in the south

264
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
He been waiting for this moment how long have you been looking for a case

265
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
7/8 years

266
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
7 light years

267
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Cuz just too

268
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
Laid out explicitly what why did you need I need a test case

269
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
You can't change a law like that

270
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
If you don't have

271
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
A case

272
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
People in the Texas legislature have been trying to remove this law from the book

273
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
Books for years according to Jill Carpenter every time someone would introduce a proposal to repeal the law it would

274
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature

275
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
It just wasn't really going anywhere

276
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,311
So activist who decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the legislature and go straight to the courts

277
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
So I need a case I had to have a someone guilty

278
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,991
Celine start trying to track them down at this point that you guys have been released from jail

279
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Conversation basically went like this

280
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,439
Hi my name is Lane Lewis I'm a gay activist here in town you don't know me

281
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
Oh that's not important but I understand you've been arrested

282
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
I'm begging you not to plead out

283
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Meeting don't just say you did it and pay the fine I knew I couldn't have them played out I will find you

284
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Do lawyers

285
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Raise the money I will pay for everything

286
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Just

287
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Don't do anything

288
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Until you when I have a notch

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Opportunity to me

290
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Weeks later they all meet at Mitchell katine xoffice

291
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
And it immediately becomes clear that these guys are sort of an Odd Couple John Lawrence at that time was

292
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
About he was 55 years old

293
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
Lab technician for a hospital with a young skinny black guy 24 years younger than John

294
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
Study job and job to job no idea why

295
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
What their connection was they weren't lovers

296
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Both heavy drinkers

297
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Very heavy

298
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Both have criminal records

299
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
Tyrone has been convicted of assault and drug possession and John have been convicted in the sixties of Murder By

300
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
Automobile yeah they were not the perfect plan that they were not the poster boy these or not

301
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Pretty tween

302
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
And they weren't political no not at all

303
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Not at all

304
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
Weanling told John Lawrence

305
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,287
I'm a gay activist here in town John Lawrence didn't even know what that was I don't know what a gay activist is

306
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,639
Basically neither of them had any interest like no interest

307
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
And being a public figure

308
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
You're so

309
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
I gave him the whole

310
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,903
What your country can do for you ask not what you can do for your country speech I mean literally

311
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
I reminded them of who Harry hay was

312
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Arguably the founder of the original LGBT movement

313
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,239
Ulysses may not remember but at one time it was illegal for

314
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Certain number of gay male

315
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
And the LGBT community

316
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
To get together in one location is illegal

317
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
Can do it the idea that they would be Networks

318
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
I'm sanctuaries in places where we can come an hour to which we would be able to move and organize and change things across the

319
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
The country

320
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
So I told him a little bit about that history in

321
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
How far we've come and how far we had to go

322
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
And that

323
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Badinage

324
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
How to change that

325
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
So I told him

326
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
I said

327
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
I'll be able to protect you

328
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
For maybe the first year or two

329
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
But there's going to come a time when

330
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
It will no longer be about you

331
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
It'll be about some

332
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Much much bigger

333
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
So

334
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
They agreed

335
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
Tyrone's attitude was okay

336
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
What do you need me to do

337
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
John was much more indignant

338
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
They took the wrong person

339
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Golden song

340
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
It was a ridiculous law

341
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
But

342
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
Texas loves to keep Samantha

343
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Quiet things around

344
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
He was mad

345
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
He was angry

346
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Here's where the story gets

347
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Complicated

348
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Because

349
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
At one point according to Lane Lewis

350
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,159
They were having this conversation and John was ranting you know about how he been treated and

351
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
He said you know what the worst part is we won't even

352
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
He said

353
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
That they were not having sex

354
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
Wait what but they were not having sex they were

355
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Sitting in their underwear on the couch

356
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Watching the late-night news

357
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,895
They say they were sitting there doing nothing and the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and

358
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
But they were never even having sex

359
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
Wave it is in this whole case about them having sex

360
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
So you're saying the thing that this case is supposed to be about

361
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Might not be true

362
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Right so I interviewed

363
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Three of the four police off

364
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
Carpenter says when he talked to the police officers

365
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
He did find that their stories were sort of all over the

366
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
The place one guy said it was anal sex seesaw

367
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
One day later said he thought it might have been oral

368
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Officer said they never saw anything

369
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,591
Fidel says he believes John story there probably was actually no sex

370
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
You think what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gaytard on the wall and some gay magazines lying around

371
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Feeling that really set off the office

372
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:00,927
And they said well we know they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point and that's illegal in Texas

373
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,535
No no I'm not there was no no no doubt about it I mean I have no

374
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
No reason to live Quinn to this day

375
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Still insist that he walked in on them

376
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Copulating he says he saw what he saw and he just did his job

377
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
That's fine I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's

378
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
My opinion that's what it is

379
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,783
So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but

380
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
In a way it doesn't matter

381
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
Because when John said that Tulane that they weren't even having sex

382
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Message on don't ever say that again

383
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Don't ever say that to anybody

384
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Again

385
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Because we could have people know that

386
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
We couldn't have people find that out

387
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
Is it going to go forward to this yet we were scared that

388
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,335
Another case would get screwed up at that point

389
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
And potentially

390
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,783
The da dropping the charges if police report

391
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
You had to preserve the LIE

392
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Correct correct

393
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Dumb question

394
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,951
You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going

395
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,535
Is that that's okay it wasn't our job

396
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
2

397
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Prove or disprove the LIE

398
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,239
The thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that night the thing that mattered

399
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Arrest report

400
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Set but if what the arrest report said

401
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Potentially didn't happen

402
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Should that matter

403
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Well

404
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
No no one

405
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth this is a misc

406
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Conception does not bring out the

407
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
Hotel Carpenter against people who play their roles

408
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
And pursuing

409
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
Whatever they think their best interests are

410
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
That's exactly what happened

411
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
So

412
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
For the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the news

413
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
And why was that

414
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Well they had a tendency to drink

415
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
And get Rowdy and fight

416
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,455
And they like to go to CD hotels and rent rooms and get really really

417
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Hi drunk whatever

418
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
And inevitably they would start fighting with each other

419
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
And so

420
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
What I did what I would do without wood

421
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
I knew the difference

422
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,327
Places they've stayed since he would go to the city hotels and talk to the clerk's give him a business card tell him

423
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
If these boys come and check in they cause problems

424
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Call me first

425
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
Fan on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2 in the morning

426
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm going to have to call the cops I would jump out of bed put on my clothes cuz we couldn't have them

427
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,551
You know what they're already on the front page of the Houston Chronicle we could not have our dependence

428
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
Doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol

429
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
So I would drive down there and I would figure out

430
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
Which one was causing the most problems

431
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Put them in my car

432
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,095
And I would drive them somewhere else I would separate them out

433
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
That happened more than once

434
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
More than once

435
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
Celine city of the spear that

436
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,335
John and Tyrone wood would start talking to the media and let something slip

437
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
About

438
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Their version of the story

439
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,015
So we gave them these little cards kept small little sentence basically said

440
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
Thank you for contacting me

441
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
Please refer to line Lewis and had my phone number in my ear

442
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
And I said so anytime to Media contacts you

443
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Don't think about what you say

444
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,119
Right that's what you get screwed up when you start thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of your wallet

445
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Read it

446
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
Even though there were these close calls

447
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
As a case wound its way through the court system

448
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
Mitchell katine told me about this

449
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
One time there was this

450
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Press conference

451
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
And we came outside to the normal media

452
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Group that was out there wanting

453
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,087
Quotes and talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers that wanted to hear from the clients

454
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
He was like all right

455
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Just this once

456
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
Tyrone get up to the mic and I think a reporter asked him

457
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
You know how do you feel about this

458
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
And he said

459
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
We didn't do anything wrong

460
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
He just kind of yelled at out and

461
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Angry way we didn't do anything wrong

462
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
Metropolitan back and was like that's enough

463
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
That's enough next day

464
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
We didn't do anything wrong

465
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
That was the quote on the headlines of the mornings

466
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
Paper the next day and certainly I knew what you meant

467
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
But they weren't having sex what you know

468
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Could also be interpreted as

469
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Homosexual conduct

470
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Nothing wrong

471
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
He says luckily

472
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
That's how people took it

473
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,864
Fracking

474
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Couple years

475
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
You're kind of how it went down

476
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
They started at this

477
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,312
Justice of the Peace Court they were sentenced to a fine of 125 bucks so happy old

478
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Send the case gets kicked up one level to the Harris County Criminal Court their find again they appeal it again

479
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,832
Level to the 14th court of appeals onemorelevel ultimately the Texas Criminal

480
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Court of appeals which has the highest

481
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Court of Texas

482
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Criminal Appeals refused even to hear the case

483
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
So the only next step is

484
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:00,192
Will hear argument next door number 02102 John Geddes Lawrence and

485
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Tyrone

486
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
March 26th

487
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
2003

488
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Almost five years after the arrest

489
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
The case lands of the Supreme Court

490
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
And by the time it gets up there

491
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
Mister chief justice inmates

492
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
The court the story is not dwelled upon at all

493
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
They didn't say

494
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
These guys weren't in a relationship

495
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
They didn't say

496
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
If these guys were having sex

497
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
One of them was cheating on his partner

498
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,840
Seems like they might have not been having sex anyway

499
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,936
Didn't say any of those things I said

500
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
Family relationships are established that there are hundreds of thousands of people that this is about families and relationships

501
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
Relationships how people in loving relationships

502
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
Have the right to express themselves in whatever they want it's none of the state's business opportunity

503
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
In the privacy of their own home

504
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
Perform the same function

505
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:57,792
You know basically people in relationships have the right to have sex with each other regardless of their gender

506
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Protected forever

507
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
The distance from

508
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Fundamental matter

509
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Of American values

510
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Wow

511
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,336
It's like watching something float up from the sort of monkey like Realm of of humor real life and then it just

512
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
It's kind of pretty rats

513
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Netflix app

514
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Yeah

515
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
It was such a pretty story that people words

516
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Suspicious

517
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
My people were asking

518
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,368
How did this arrest even happen this was a setup you all set this up

519
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
That was their big Battle Cry

520
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,488
Show me Tokyo teen says he heard this over and over again

521
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:32,096
But I always want to say so so what if it was does that make it any less

522
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,168
Uppercase who care has further questions

523
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
Thank you very much

524
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,336
The Honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next

525
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
10

526
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
3 months later

527
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:53,344
Record number 02102 Lawrence against Texas

528
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
Justice Kennedy begins reading a summary of His

529
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
The question before the court

530
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
Have a Texas statute

531
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
For two persons of the same sex

532
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Intimate sexual

533
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
Everybody's waiting for the out

534
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Houston

535
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Texas

536
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
Super context it wasn't totally clear how this case was going to come out because 17 years earlier there'd been a case called

537
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
Bowers vs Hardwick

538
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
And

539
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
Then they ruled that sodomy laws were fine

540
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,672
There is no constitutional

541
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Conclusion

542
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
But there should be a fundamental right to engage

543
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Homosexual sodomy

544
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,376
And Supreme Court almost never will sings order that recent

545
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
So Justice Kennedy starts talking about all the similarities between the cases

546
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Dispatched

547
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,432
The tension starts building

548
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
And then finally he got

549
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
To the moment where he said

550
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
And it's not correct today

551
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,120
And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were

552
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
People sobbing

553
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
Stars versus Hardwick should be

554
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
Rallies Across the Nation gay rights Advocates celebrated their legal Victory a ruling so brought it surprised even many of

555
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,416
Court rules in favor of two Texas man who challenged a state law that made homosexual

556
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,792
The ruling overturned a Texas law that allowed police to arrest gays for having sex

557
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
12 other states have similar laws

558
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,448
Including a good morning John Lawrence was at home in his apartment in Houston

559
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
Watching the tanks

560
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,616
And all of a sudden it says has rule the law in concert

561
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
I came out of bed quite happy

562
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,352
Obviously not everybody

563
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,960
What's happy about it clear that I have nothing against homosexuals

564
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
Promoting their agenda

565
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Justice Scalia said

566
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Basically

567
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,760
If you want this to happen that's fine but you're going about it the wrong way the court is not the place where this decision

568
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,088
Should be made you need to go talk to your fellow citizens

569
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
And convince them that this

570
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Blonde needs stitches

571
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
Coming to us and asking us to bypass

572
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
What your fellow citizens seem to want that is

573
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
It's not how

574
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
Persuading one's fellow citizens

575
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,240
And imposing one's views in absence of democratic

576
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
Is something else

577
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
He sees this as a

578
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Small minority imposing their views

579
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
On everybody else

580
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Ebony

581
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Said he was worried about something else

582
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Today's opinion

583
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Dismantle

584
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,904
The structure of constitutional law

585
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,976
That has permitted a distinction to be made

586
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
Between heterosexual

587
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
I'm homosexual

588
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
Set this decision would open the floodgates

589
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
And that it would only be a matter of time

590
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Before the court was being asked

591
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
To decide on gay marriage

592
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,456
And he was right when Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015

593
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
The courthouse

594
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,064
Private intimacy of same-sex couples

595
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
Yet it does not follow the freedom stop

596
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
Outlaw to outcast

597
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Maybe a step forward but it does not

598
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
So what happened to

599
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
Garner and Laura

600
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Well

601
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,496
John Lawrence and Tyrone Garner didn't live to see this

602
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
Tyrone died in 2006 from meningitis

603
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
No job

604
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Had no money

605
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,968
He was 39 and his family was very poor

606
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
And they didn't have the money to bury him

607
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
They didn't even have the money to reclaim his body from

608
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
County morgue

609
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,952
As for John Lawrence he died in 2011 at 68

610
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,536
From heart problems we didn't even find out about it until a month after he

611
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
It was dead

612
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
This hero of the gay rights movement

613
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Was unknown and under

614
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Is passing

615
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
What is a fairy about

616
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Sort of boat

617
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Practice of bringing things to the Supreme Court

618
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
The two people who story this case revolves around

619
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
Concerta Fade Into the background afterwards

620
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,512
Well one is tempted I think to be very cynical in some ways because it means that

621
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
These people were useful as long as they were useful in after that they could be forgotten

622
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Galaxy had that reaction a little bit I mean this is

623
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,080
Story of social progress but there's something a little funny at the center of it for me

624
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,968
NFL gear playing this for our legal editor Italian style

625
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
In a lot of ways are our legal system

626
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
Duval's in to an end

627
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Justifies the means

628
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
Kind of Justice

629
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
We we care we we we care about the process so much

630
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,816
Manitowoc the processes

631
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:28,448
Extremely important Ellie isn't this just weird to you like this is a dumb law like a dumb dumb dumb dumb law

632
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Why not to

633
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,848
Should there be an Avenue to say this is a dumb law was taken away why do you have to find some people

634
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
2

635
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Didn't

636
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Have

637
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Sex they say

638
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
10 + 1/2

639
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,576
And March them up all the way through the court system and then forget about the time you just seems weird to me

640
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Seems like a

641
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Empty theater

642
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Why do we have to do it that way

643
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,768
Because if you want to put a ballot initiative up in 2003 in Texas saying

644
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
Is gay sex okay

645
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
It would fail

646
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
It would fail in 2003 in

647
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
You probably fail in 2016 in test

648
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
To probably fail

649
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
In 2032

650
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
In Texas

651
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
That's why

652
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
That's why

653
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
The majority isn't always right

654
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
So you you you you

655
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Take the USB take the Democratic at

656
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,856
And this isn't this is a this goes back right to the founding of our country

657
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
Like when are you going to let popular will

658
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
Run wild and when are you going to

659
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Constraineth

660
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
Not just restrain a country

661
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
You know when you going to stop it

662
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Amanda

663
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Why do Texas is a is an example of a

664
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
We just going to stop

665
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
And it was the right call

666
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,320
So after this Supreme Court decision to Texas immediately go and repeal the law

667
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
No actually the laws still on the books in Texas

668
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Know the Texas legislature

669
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,608
Like other legislatures around the country refuses to repeal the law it stays there assertive

670
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Remnant of a

671
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Kind of a dark

672
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
Almost forgotten past

673
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,384
Keep in mind they can't enforce the law now that is unconstitutional

674
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
But they refuse to take it off

675
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,184
Coming up a very deep dive into the guy behind one of the most

676
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
Universal cases this term in case that just got decided late last week

677
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
Score perfect

678
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
United States

679
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
Hi my name is Peter Fink

680
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
And I'm calling from ritsona refugee camp

681
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
In Evia Greece

682
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,496
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

683
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,592

684

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

687
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
And I'm here because I need your help

688
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
And I request

689
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

690
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,936
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

691
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,288
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

692
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,640
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that

693
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
Maybe it was the moment that I

694
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,504
I kid you been reading to 4 month started reading back

695
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Do you

696
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

697
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,928
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

698
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,792
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

699
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
We're interested in the

700
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
Epic moments where

701
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,728
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

702
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
If you have a story

703
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288

Record short audio message

707
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,992
And that's radiolab.org / brilliant

708
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Thank you so much

709
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,960
This is more perfect I'm chat album Rod if Supreme Court cases can sometimes feel like plays

710
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:50,336
Where the activist and lawyers are sort of like the directors pulling the strings in the people in the center of the case

711
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
The plaintiffs are just

712
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Imperfect actors

713
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Pooping cast

714
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
And the scripts are written for them will that dynamic

715
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
Definitely an effect this term

716
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,208
Texas last week we have had a decision just handed down

717
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,816
In what was billed as the landmark affirmative action case

718
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
Of this term

719
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,312
University of Texas centers round the following question

720
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,872
Use racial preferences in college admissions

721
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
Now the University of Texas has a policy where the

722
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,528
The top 10% of every High School class automatically get in but for everybody else

723
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
They will consider factors like race in the question was

724
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
Is that okay

725
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Couple days ago the court decided

726
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Barely

727
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,912
But yes it is okay the Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas

728
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
Fraction and higher education is constitutional

729
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher

730
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040
Race may have hurt her chances to attend the University of Texas

731
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,904
Activities I was in who were being accepted into UT and the only other difference between us

732
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,256
She was arguing that affirmative action discriminates against

733
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Her his wife

734
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Carson now

735
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
What you saw in the wake of that decision and even before

736
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Eonline

737
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Courant

738
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
Hate

739
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Directed

740
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,384
Fairland okay

741
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
Get into a good college black people have it better

742
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,576
If you don't take your baby if your grace didn't suck your dumbass

743
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,136
Maybe you would have gotten into a good college

744
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Becky with the bad grades

745
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
Really happy you and your racist lawyer got shot down

746
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,400
Because this case may have very little to do that beef

747
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,984
Picture I mean if you look at the press conference

748
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,288
Treated differently based on their race

749
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
Abby Fisher is the one of the podium but behind her

750
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Are the back

751
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
You'll see the sky

752
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
He's there in every single press conference quarterback

753
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,368
At the edge of the frame not too many people know about him his name is Edward Blum

754
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
And he's the one who actually brought the case

755
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,000
When it comes to this case and so many others

756
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
He is

757
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
The architect

758
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
He's brought dozens of lawsuits notches

759
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
This one ad

760
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
He seems to be a maestro of getting cases

761
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,592
Is to the Supreme Court that challenged civil rights law

762
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
Critics or paint messes like one-man Wrecking Crew

763
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
For civil rights

764
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,552
He's almost single-handedly rolling back Decades of civil rights law

765
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,696
And when it comes to affirmative action he says he's not done just to make a long story short we wanted to meet him

766
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Figure out how he does it

767
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
Went to Tallahassee

768
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Border Katherine Wells takes from here

769
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
That's where you live or

770
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,960
He Winters in Tallahassee

771
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,056
You walking what initially struck you

772
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Golden Retriever

773
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Is what initially struck me

774
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,992
Literally physically like

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Of course

776
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
And

777
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,880
I don't know what I was expecting but when you hear about these cases you know

778
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Critics are really

779
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
People are mad about

780
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,840
Case it is deeply disturbing truly outrageous

781
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,400
So I go to meet him and your flight

782
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
From Austin

783
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448

784
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
To Tallahassee uneventful and

785
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
On time and

786
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,872
Good he's like a totally nice guy

787
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
A regular guy

788
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Was it look like

789
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
Like a dad there's something in me that just loves

790
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
Tradition Inn

791
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Custom you love

792
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Listen to The Great American Songbook

793
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
Beautiful thing

794
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Frank Sinatra

795
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
And hum

796
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
Ella Fitzgerald

797
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
I love

798
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
Art and Museum

799
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,264
Independent films golf what's his what's the story with his backstory

800
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
Well he's 64

801
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
Small town

802
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
In Michigan

803
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
My dad owned a shoe store their my mom worked with him in the shoe store

804
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Cleaning up to

805
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
I'm

806
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
The first Republican my mother ever met

807
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
How to use the word typical but it

808
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
It really was a typical liberal

809
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Jewish household

810
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
My mother and father

811
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
Where Franklin Roosevelt

812
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Harry Truman Democrats

813
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
Always

814
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
Democrat and he said he was

815
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
That way to all the way through college

816
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
The University of Texas

817
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:48,064
Grad school University of New York where I spent a year studying of all things

818
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
African literature

819
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,488
But he says somewhere along the way his political leanings

820
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,792
Started started to shift I spend

821
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
A summer in Israel

822
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Living on a

823
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:08,032
Auntie says he came out of that experience a little less liberal than he was before

824
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,712
And you got married and then in the early 80s he's living in Houston working as a stockbroker

825
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
And

826
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
We met

827
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
Aren't our neighbors

828
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
This particular couple they were New Yorkers who would move to Houston both grew up as

829
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:33,888
Liberals and the guy she opened my eyes

830
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
To the world of the Neo cons

831
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,872
National Review commentary magazine conservative magazine

832
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
And this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting its stride

833
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
Garibaldi's New York liberals

834
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
Defecting

835
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Is what he says

836
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Bowser

837
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
Individuals who grew up

838
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Question

839
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
The wisdom

840
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Obvious liberal

841
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
And he says slowly

842
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
Overtime very

843
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Graduate

844
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
He became one of those people

845
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:14,336
Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston Garden variety

846
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,128
Existence and

847
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
Something happens that sends him on this entirely new

848
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
What path

849
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,272
Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood

850
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,088
The move from the suburbs into the downtown area

851
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
Urban and in 1990

852
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
When

853
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,024
We went to vote for the first time in our new neighborhood

854
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,352
I realized that the Republican

855
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,400
Party had not fielded

856
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Candidate

857
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
To oppose the

858
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Democrat

859
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Incumbent

860
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Running for congress this is a

861
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
District that has

862
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,128
Almost 600 thousand people

863
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,760
You don't have a choice you only got one person running

864
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
Decided to run himself

865
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
I lost item

866
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
It was no great surprise to anyone

867
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
He actually lost by 32 point

868
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
But along the way

869
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
It's something really unusual happened

870
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
During my campaign he and his wife Lark piano they decided they were going to go meet voters in their District

871
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,080
I got a giant print out of all of the addresses in the 18th congressional district

872
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:23,456
Call daywalking list and they just started going door-to-door meeting people handing out literature

873
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,272
And I'd walk down say Oak Street

874
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Take

875
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,672
The even side of Oak Street and my wife would take the odd

876
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Numbered side of

877
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Oak Street

878
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
And we would start to walk and

879
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,888
Very quickly they realized that

880
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
The district

881
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Shape

882
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Was funny

883
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,104
Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side wouldn't and sometimes the district would

884
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,663
McDonough Highway caption apartment,

885
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,199
Flex come back at it just

886
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Didn't make sense

887
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom was peculiar because we had Maps

888
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
We had to follow

889
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
And it was

890
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
Very odd the way some streets were

891
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
And the districts and some weren't

892
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,375
Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this could happen

893
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
After I guess a better week of this

894
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,567
We realized that neighbors had been separated

895
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,431
Almost house my house because of their race

896
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
You come to believe that the reason this was done

897
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,879
Was for the explicit purpose to create a majority at

898
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
African American

899
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
This is an untrue

900
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of 1960

901
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,287
Of Americans are denied

902
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
The right

903
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
McCall of their color

904
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
This act was

905
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
Giant

906
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,479
Step forward in civil rights

907
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,367
One of the primary things that day it is eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests all these

908
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,927
Strategies that have been used to keep minorities

909
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,839
And then this other thing it did sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is

910
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
Encourage the creation of districts where the majority of Voters

911
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Where minorities

912
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
And that's because

913
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,823
You know one of the strategies that have been used previously to

914
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,455
Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and

915
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,991
They called it cracking lately

916
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
Split them apart into many different

917
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
So that they were never

918
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
In the majority

919
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Elect representatives

920
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct

921
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Bat

922
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
18th congressional district

923
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,607
Was one of these majority-minority districts

924
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
The district

925
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
Drawn by the text

926
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
But you have a slight

927
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,519
African American majority

928
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
I think about 51%

929
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
African Amer

930
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,383
But this was the problem according to bloom

931
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
The way they got to that

932
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:07,295
African American majority was bite creating this District that's zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhood

933
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
I could not understand

934
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
People live close together they

935
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,975
Eccentric kids to the neighborhood schools they shopped in the neighborhood

936
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,279
Shopping centers they were worried about

937
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Neighborhood issues

938
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
Rick these neighborhoods apart

939
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
By race

940
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Seemed

941
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
So wrong

942
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,055
In his mind this law was actually

943
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,127
Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetua

944
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
I don't know what a

945
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
The average person upon realizing this would have done

946
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
I decided

947
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
To file a lawsuit

948
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
Decided to sue the state of tech

949
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Call the few

950
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Friends

951
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Who lived in the 18th District

952
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,959
And a few other districts in Texas American American Hispanic and Asian kept looking and looking and looking and

953
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
Until I found a lawyer that I could afford $7,000 a month filed a lawsuit challenging the

954
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,943
Constitutionality Texas's redistricting plan

955
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,271
Recent charged with yes the Voting Rights Act was good in its day

956
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,647
But now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized

957
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
Worked its way through the lower courts and

958
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Tomorrow

959
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
And surprise

960
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
In 1995

961
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
Number 94805 George W bush vs Alvera of the Supreme Court

962
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
Look it up

963
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
Yeah we all did

964
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
Court so there we all are

965
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
Our opponents

966
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
Step to the lectern and

967
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,391
The constitutionality of three congressional districts they make

968
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,487
Their arguments

969
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,583
Texas basically said all we have to put people together by race

970
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,399
The Texas legislature has the obligation

971
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,007
To satisfy Federal requirements in the federal requirements

972
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,871
Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this District

973
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:13,759
So that they have a chance to elect a representative or advocate

974
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
His arguments

975
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
That was just being made I said

976
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,439
But look at the map

977
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
The map is

978
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
Bizarre

979
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
And the only reason

980
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
It could have gotten this way as

981
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Because you're only thinking about race

982
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Only race

983
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,263
Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is

984
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
You cannot use

985
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:42,943
Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool

986
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
A very tense situation

987
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,775
Let me explain

988
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
So in the end

989
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:14,943
Supreme Court

990
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Hair-splitting

991
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
But I think it's at this deeper question that

992
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
In our society

993
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,207
Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about anyway

994
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:31,839
You don't look if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin

995
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:38,239
The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take the

996
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,639
Wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context then

997
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,247
How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account that they have to

998
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
So it's a difficult balance

999
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
You can't look at race

1000
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
But you have to look

1001
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
And

1002
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,951
The Supreme Court says to Texas look

1003
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,535
All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on us

1004
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,655
You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if he's communities with next to each other

1005
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
You're just sorting them based on

1006
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
Race alone and that's not good enough

1007
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
You can't do that when the

1008
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
Opinion came down

1009
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor five

1010
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479
That was

1011
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Quite

1012
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
A day

1013
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
The day that we won that lawsuit

1014
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,207
I was

1015
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Hooked forever

1016
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
After that Edward Bloom decided that this would be expected became

1017
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:45,055
Do you support to try to strike down every race-based policy he could legal team

1018
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
I was taking on the road I recruited plaintiffs in New York Virginia South Carolina to check

1019
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
Challenge congressional district

1020
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,831
Plans and we won in each of those States

1021
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231
He helps to school districts in Florida and Texas and the use of racial quotas in case through 12

1022
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
Magnet schools affirmative action in Houston city Contracting

1023
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,471
Kill affirmative action

1024
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
I've been the architect of a over two dozen lawsuits

1025
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Six of which

1026
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
Made it to the Supreme Court

1027
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
Including

1028
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
In 2013 in a 5-2 for vote very divided court and supreme court today struck down

1029
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
He parts

1030
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:36,767
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 Supreme Court struck down a very important part of the Voting Rights Act

1031
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:43,167
She 1965 Landmark lock is considered one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation

1032
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,007
They Shoulda never pass Shelby County vs holder this decision

1033
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,055
Gutted the Voting Rights Act

1034
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
Specifically there was as part of it that said

1035
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
States and counties with a history of discrimination

1036
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,223
How to check with the federal government first

1037
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,319
Before they go about changing their voting laws basically the federal government was saying look

1038
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
You've been up to all this stuff we're now we're watching

1039
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Supreme Court said

1040
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
You know

1041
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Time for change

1042
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,303
That list was made a long time ago and

1043
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
It's update

1044
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
This decision

1045
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,983
Restores an important constitutional order to our system of government

1046
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
This was Bloom's bigots

1047
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
When Shelby County

1048
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
I think a lot of people burst into tears when they came down

1049
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Disturbing

1050
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Deeply disappointed

1051
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
Deeply disappointed

1052
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
With a court

1053
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,999
Decision in this matter

1054
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Change during the Civil Rights Movement people died

1055
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
For the precious right to vote

1056
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,679
This is congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston

1057
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:54,335
I would like to have the Supreme Court Justices go back in time go back

1058
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,967
Sometime and March with those who marched after Bloody Sunday

1059
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
I from Selma to Montgomery

1060
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
A balloon has a right to his opinion

1061
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the

1062
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
The United States

1063
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
I understand that

1064
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
People were in a

1065
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
Gravely

1066
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Upset

1067
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
I also know that they were

1068
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,583
People who were Gravely relieved

1069
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
And Gravely

1070
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
Ratify

1071
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,471
Yeah but I think what gets a lot of people

1072
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Is it

1073
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
You look at the Civil Rights

1074
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Videos UC

1075
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:29,151
Thousands 40,000 people in the streets marching and

1076
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
You hold that if you make a split screen in your mind

1077
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Hold that thousand ten thousand people in one side

1078
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
On the other side

1079
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
You one guy

1080
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,903
It does make you ask basic questions about tomorrow

1081
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
That's a false

1082
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Paradigm

1083
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
It's

1084
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,071
That maybe your split screen but that's

1085
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Really not

1086
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
Good luck in 19

1087
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
6419

1088
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,567
America was held hostage

1089
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Bye

1090
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
The legacies of slavery

1091
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
And the

1092
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Choke hold

1093
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
Jim Crow

1094
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Fast

1095
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Forward

1096
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
To 2006

1097
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
The reauthorization

1098
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Of

1099
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
The Voting Rights

1100
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
The

1101
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Choke hold

1102
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
Had gone

1103
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
Away

1104
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
African Americans

1105
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
In the Deep South

1106
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
Registered to vote

1107
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
In numbers

1108
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Often exceeded

1109
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
Participated in elections

1110
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
Trends in numbers that

1111
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
Exceeded

1112
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
In terms of

1113
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
Elektra Opera

1114
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Opportunities

1115
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
We have

1116
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Come

1117
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
180 degrees

1118
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
From

1119
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,463
1960s degrees because of the law which you helped overturn

1120
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,839
In an instant we don't know it's a boy degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a lot

1121
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
Cat people online

1122
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
And now that love has gone

1123
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,263
And now we see voter ID laws coming back in the play which I think any

1124
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,103
Like sane person would admit is it is it is it is an attempt a blatant attempt

1125
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Disenfranchised

1126
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,479
People who it feels a little bit strange that two I mean I completely agree with your things have gotten better

1127
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Same time I think

1128
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
Well that was because of the law that's now gone

1129
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,391
Look laws change

1130
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Laws

1131
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
Evolve

1132
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
+ and at some point

1133
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,303
They need to come to an end

1134
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Okay

1135
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
So just to jump back in

1136
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
Play something we haven't

1137
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Actually talked about yet

1138
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Is

1139
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Original question how

1140
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
How does this actually happened how does it work

1141
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,295
How is one person

1142
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Able to be so effective

1143
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,903
To do this work you need a car

1144
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
Computer a printer a cell phone

1145
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Really about it

1146
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
Play who pays for the lawyer fees

1147
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,191
Who do you go to individuals that know of my work

1148
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
There are

1149
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
Foundations

1150
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,103
Okay so he's a 501 c 3 like the n-double-acp and Lambda legal that funded

1151
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
Lawrence versus Texas

1152
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,455
And if you're a 501 c 3 public

1153
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,271
Charity as he has you don't have to reveal your donors to the

1154
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,855
We do know a couple of his donors though and they're

1155
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
Wealthy very conservative

1156
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
So in the end what he does is

1157
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Just sort of a

1158
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
More

1159
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,375
Maybe more strategic or sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first

1160
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Like

1161
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
In this case that he just lost

1162
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Last week

1163
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,263
We wanted to challenge affirmative action

1164
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
So

1165
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,591
The first thing you did was sort of do a cast

1166
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,639
He said to find the perfect

1167
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
White suit

1168
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,807
Set up a website called UT not fair. Org

1169
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:53,183
Race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty budget it's just him looking at the camera

1170
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,327
In front of a poster that says UT not fair

1171
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
To visit at

1172
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
UT not fair. Org

1173
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Tell us your story

1174
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
How many started talking to the people who respond

1175
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
I think I ended up with

1176
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,103
175

1177
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Responses

1178
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,455
Of those about a hundred were

1179
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
Viable

1180
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,527
With the 75 you throughout just

1181
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,415
Didn't think they would be sympathetic

1182
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,535
Whittled a hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic 7

1183
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,815
Number 1 or 2

1184
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
Did not

1185
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
Really want to go forward

1186
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
Like I don't want the attention or they were fearful

1187
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
Aveeno

1188
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
The backlash

1189
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,871
To make a long story short he ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said

1190
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Hey my daughter just got rich

1191
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Rejected from UT

1192
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
I heard you were looking

1193
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
I think I'm a very

1194
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
Like a very like introverted person so I feel

1195
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
Like sometimes it is a lot of pressure

1196
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:03,839
I think it's in the end it's totally worth it and and to be able to tab a voice

1197
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,191
In this into know that my voice is making a difference is really reward

1198
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,239
She seemed like the perfect planet

1199
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,847
Strawberry blonde hair she's petite she's kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way

1200
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
But last week

1201
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:17,919
They lost

1202
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:24,831
Sweet talk to him before all this happened so we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell on Austin news

1203
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,855
Paper that

1204
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
The night after the decision came down

1205
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
He had three glasses of wine

1206
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
He took an Ambien

1207
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,815
What about this particular lyrics

1208
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
In a Billy Joel song

1209
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
The song called Keeping the Faith

1210
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
I'm a long distance

1211
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
Runner

1212
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,151
If there's something just emblematic about my personality

1213
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Run

1214
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,711
Long distance

1215
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,015
He says he's definitely not done

1216
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
He's

1217
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,343
Actually already has two more cases against

1218
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Affirmative action in the works

1219
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,951
I have retained counsel to litigate

1220
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
Harvard admissions portal

1221
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
University of North Carolina's admission

1222
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,423
I'm am Sergeant just doesn't strike anyone I mean forget the politics whether you're on on lucite or not.

1223
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,215
The tactic doesn't strike anyone else

1224
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Fishing

1225
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,055
I resist giving Ed Bloom that much credit

1226
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
It's aliens Dollar General Eagle ad

1227
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
I would say

1228
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
The fundamentally he's just implementing

1229
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,991
A strategy that was perfected

1230
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,831
By the people he now ironically seeks to disenfranchise

1231
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,879
On this is civil rights movement 101

1232
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
He's got laws if he doesn't like

1233
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,719
That he knows he can't

1234
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Overturn

1235
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Through an election

1236
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
Clemson failed Congressional candidate

1237
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,143
He had that Lust For for political power

1238
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,215
Couldn't get it through the electoral system but he found this other way

1239
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,031
I'm to do it this is exactly what this is

1240
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,359
Okay so tell me this is one of the most

1241
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Fascinating

1242
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
Things about the story

1243
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,551
If we go back to remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy versus Ferguson

1244
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,391
Starting to not really I think is a good example

1245
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,791
This is Susan Carr law professor at American University Washington College of Law

1246
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,887
Plessy versus Ferguson 1892 that was a case

1247
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:18,239
Where are the state of Louisiana

1248
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,799
Law which said that people of color

1249
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,615
White people could not ride in the same train cars

1250
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,919
If you heard the story

1251
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,479
This is how it goes with somebody named Homer Plessy

1252
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,063
Black man sits down in a white car he is arrested

1253
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,623
He decides to Sue and his case goes all the way to the Sea

1254
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Supreme Court

1255
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
The thing about that case

1256
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,999
Is that it was a total setup

1257
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Leaving

1258
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,935
So we go back when Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups were out

1259
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983
Obviously horrified by this but

1260
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,287
The railroad companies were actually

1261
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:56,127
Mad about this too because they thought it would be much more expensive to run the trains

1262
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,943
If they had to have add additional training so they have

1263
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
White cars in Cars of color

1264
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295
And so right activist

1265
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
Companies

1266
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,903
They recruited somebody named Homer Plessy

1267
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
78

1268
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
White 1/8 Safra

1269
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,327
And they sent him to go sit in a white car

1270
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
On a train

1271
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,631
He got into a

1272
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
First class

1273
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
People's car

1274
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
And they said somebody to go arrest him like they got a off-duty police officer

1275
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
Ashley hired

1276
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,967
You could do that at the time that you can hire a private detective to make

1277
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
And today they hired that person to sew

1278
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
Plus he gets onto the train

1279
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,951
The conductor comes by and plessis Lake

1280
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,767
Just thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black

1281
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,351
And the conductor says well in that case you're going to need to be on the other

1282
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,911
Car in the string Homer Plessy says

1283
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,519
I'm good actually I I'm going to be staying right here and the conductor says

1284
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,871
No really you have to move and Homer Plessy it says no really not going to

1285
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:05,247
Things get heated and eventually this detective that they've hired comes in and arrest him

1286
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
Brought a lawsuit

1287
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,927
That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with

1288
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
To challenge

1289
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Is the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the US

1290
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
Supreme Court

1291
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,375
And they were hoping that they would be able to establish

1292
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
That the idea of separating

1293
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
The races with uncut

1294
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Institutional

1295
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,007
But unfortunately they miss

1296
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,823
Calculated in the Court ruled that the law

1297
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Was

1298
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Constitution

1299
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,151
And what they got instead was

1300
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Separate but equal

1301
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
Totally backfired

1302
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
But

1303
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,343
It was this early example of this other way

1304
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
You know if you can

1305
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,183
Find a plaintiff for create a plaintiff

1306
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,535
You might be able to bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead

1307
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,839
The n-double-acp later pickup on the

1308
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,631
Today weather true

1309
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Geniuses

1310
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
They perfected it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly unlike

1311
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,151
For example in the early 1900s they do things like send

1312
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,991
A black guy in a white guy all over New York City to segregated theaters

1313
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,111
And see if one of them was prevented from being seated

1314
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
And if they were

1315
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
They would sue those theaters

1316
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,023
And when victories that way

1317
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:26,143
Then there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody could buy a house

1318
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:32,543
Or live on a block in with white people lives if they were African American so they were

1319
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,943
Create a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say you said you would

1320
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,247
By the house but

1321
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:47,647
I'm not buying the house because I can't live there white guys who's the black guy that was a manufacturer

1322
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
2 case

1323
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
It was one of the

1324
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
First victory

1325
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,815
And that's the case where Justice Homestead in

1326
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
Dissent that he ended up. Publishing

1327
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,167
Hey wait a minute this isn't even a real case

1328
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
What's the time

1329
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,567
Anything that involves manufacturing a case

1330
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,615
Fomenting litigation

1331
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
All of those things were

1332
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,223
Illegal to not just unethical but actually illegal

1333
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Yes

1334
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,015
Criminally illegal

1335
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
Sienna's

1336
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,463
Something like how we see ambulance-chasing today the lawyers for the n-double-acp were very aware of AC

1337
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,023
And this came to a head in the 19th

1338
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
ICP

1339
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,399
Wanted to get the court to end segregated

1340
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Basically they wanted

1341
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
To overturn Plessy versus

1342
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
Ferguson

1343
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
And the way they were doing this

1344
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:39,871
You know they needed a plaintiff so the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to

1345
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
Meetings with parents and sort of

1346
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,503
Quietly in a subtly trying to ask

1347
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
Parents if they wanted

1348
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,087
SOB's cases

1349
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
Virginia knew that they were doing this

1350
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,439
And they tightened up these regulation

1351
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
It said you know you can't

1352
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,559
Drum up litigation to try to stop them from doing this

1353
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
So the n-double-acp

1354
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
Sued

1355
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
And they took this issue all the way to the surf

1356
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Tesla

1357
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
It's essential

1358
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Because

1359
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
No matter how illegal it is

1360
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
Maggie's the Supreme Court said

1361
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,223
Actually

1362
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
Manufacturing litigation is

1363
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
Is a form of political expression

1364
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Really

1365
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
And it is totally okay

1366
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,183
Like free speech basically

1367
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
It's a way of

1368
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
Expressing your

1369
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,839
Teskey's litigation exploded

1370
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,167
After this in the 60s and 70s a lot of other movement

1371
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,751
The women's movement Poor People's movement

1372
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,871
Saw the success of civil rights movement was having with these strategies that they adopted them is

1373
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,431
And now I guess I'd include that blue

1374
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
The founding principles

1375
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
Of the Civil Rights Movement

1376
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
Have been embraced

1377
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
By the vast majority

1378
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
Noah's founding principles

1379
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,719
Those founding principles

1380
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Guide

1381
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
These laws

1382
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
That

1383
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
Basic fundamental

1384
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
Guiding principle

1385
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
The Civil Rights Movement

1386
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
And how it needs to be apply

1387
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Today I am.

1388
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,335
I can't say what I think of that on Family Guy

1389
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Family Radio

1390
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,431
That that is that is not that is on

1391
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,967
Fmovies not

1392
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
Carrying the standard forward for a civil rights in America

1393
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,135
Bailey says he is actually doing something good

1394
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,183
Deeply important to our political system

1395
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,511
Cycling I see a lot of people who

1396
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
Who agree with

1397
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Adblue

1398
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,655
There they agreed with him in a way that can't be expressed in the polls

1399
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,703
They're out there

1400
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,567
I'm this is one way for that again that's another

1401
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
Call back to the Civil Rights bill

1402
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,383
When you have a minority pocket

1403
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
The blazing sun

1404
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
They just get trampled

1405
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,527
In popular elections okay

1406
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,343
But do they still have a voice should they still

1407
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Should people have a way

1408
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
I'm to not change on their behalf

1409
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
/ the will of the majority

1410
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,023
Again

1411
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
Textbook what quarter

1412
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
Supposed to do

1413
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,143
To look out the rights of minorities political

1414
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,703
I'm more than a method of a racial or religious

1415
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,799
And see that they are not being trampled by a majoritarian attorney

1416
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,175
A bloom is helping a minority of people who believe what he believes

1417
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,991
Yeah I'm so not prepared for you saying any of this

1418
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
