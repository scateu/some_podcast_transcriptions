Radio producer

13
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
Too many slashes

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,480
Story that goes back about 70 years

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
It's it all feels like

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
Unreal in some way

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
There's something about the story that just

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
You hear it you can't help think about now

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Should we start with with

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,048
Air currents or I go with I want to start with

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
Can we go to Thermopolis Wyoming

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Cuz that was

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
It was one of the first

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Really well documented

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Lenox

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Thermopolis

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,056
My homie well as it's the first week of December 1944

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,456
This is Ross going historian he would have looked it's pretty much the definitive account of the story about to here

29
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
Hangout Thermopolis Wyoming December 1944 and there are three whiners

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,136
At a place called The High Line Coal Mine which is outside of the mouth

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
They step outside the mind one evening it's just about dusk

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
And just as they step out of the mind they hear this whistling sound over their heads and then a moment later there's

33
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
A tremendous explosion

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
And they see this

35
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
Rising cloud of dust about a mile away across the valley they turn into

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,136
Look it's Dusk and so in the fading Twilight they can't be sure exactly what they're looking at

37
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
But above them they're sort of this

38
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
Fluttering white circle just floating there

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
They made sense of it by thinking it was a parachutist

40
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
They watch this

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
Parachute as it's drifting away from them they get in their car and they chase after it

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
Until eventually they lose sight of it in the Darkness

43
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
Right around that same time

44
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,992
About 500 miles away in Colorado and his dad are working in the barn

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,624
When they hear an explosion they run outside and in their yard

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
There's just this

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Smoldering crater

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
In Wyoming a nine-year-old boy playing in his front yard here's an explosion all throughout the winter of 1944

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
In Burwell Nebraska strange

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
Parachute things native residents hear a loud explosion just start appearing in the skies All Over America

51
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
Napa California lame deer Montana 20 or so miles from downtown Detroit

52
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Over Farms Nogales Arizona slipping behind Hills Rigby Idaho everybody who sees

53
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
These things all of them have different explanations

54
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Or what they think they're witnessing

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
They think it's a plane crash on oil tank exploding the US military sends out an APB to local police station

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Sing We need information

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
What are these

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Testing testing

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
Enter Sheriff Warren hide my name is Mary and Hyde Warren Hyde actually died in 9

60
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,504
1989 so the oldest son of sheriff I we talked to his son he had a presence about him that

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
He kind of commanded a room

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,208
Jeff Hyde was a big guy black wavy hair brought of the shoulder narrow at the hips got send got on his head

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
One day he's at his office North of Salt Lake City

64
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
When

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
His phone ring

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
From what I understand dry farmer called him said there's a strange contraption

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
My field some kind of

68
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:00,896
Balloon parachute looking thing floating around so he jumped in the car and

69
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
Went hell-bent-for-leather out into the Blue Creek area there's this crazy story where he rushes out to this Farm 10

70
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Investigate

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Pops out of his car rips off his belt

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
What does 38 pistol to the man can run with a 38 pistol on his waist

73
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
And took off after the bloom

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Here's what he sees in that field

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
He was

76
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
I mean if you look at a picture of this thing it's this huge globe

77
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
30 ft in diameter

78
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Paperwhite

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
And I'm coming down

80
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
From this globe are these thick

81
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
40 ft ropes

82
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
At the bottom

83
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Attached to it is a

84
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Is a heavy metal Chandelier

85
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
With bombs

86
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Hanging off the bottom

87
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
And Sheriff hide

88
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
She sees this thing runs onto the field

89
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Grabs onto the Rope

90
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
To maybe tight down

91
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
But just as he grabs it

92
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
Augusta wind comes by lift him up off the ground like he was paper

93
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,055
And so he's dangling from the ropes of this thing the balloon is above him the explosives her are below him

94
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
And it takes him across this Canyon

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
And he's holding on just dangling from it still trying to Wrangle it like like some bucking bronco VLAN

96
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
And again he tries to tie it to a

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Juniper Bush or something but the wind catches it again and goes back over the canyon back to the first side back to the

98
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
The first signed I started float around the field he kept wrestling this balloon for a long time he's nauseous

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
From being spun around on this balloon his vision getting blurry his hands are becoming raw from the Rope but he

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
He feels dislike sense of Duty the government wanted one of these balloons his territory so he's got to take it

101
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Down that's right he finally

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,855
Lets himself free fall so he can grab it again so his weight will jerk the balloon to the ground

103
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Then finally the bloom came down in and kind of a little Ravine where Sagebrush were girl

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Going in a rooted been exposed on the side of the Ravine from a Sagebrush and he hooked his arm around the

105
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
This route then he was able to hold a balloon without being carried into the air

106
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
So you actually captured him a personal letter of thanks the end up shipping all of the f

107
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Evidence off to the Aberdeen

108
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Military

109
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Research facility where they have gathered

110
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
All this different evidence from all over the country

111
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
And

112
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
After looking at this stuff

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
For a while

114
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
They were able to tell that

115
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
Apparently this bomb

116
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
Was not of any particular American make

117
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
And match known characteristics of Japanese bombs

118
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Cyst Japanese

119
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
But it's impossible

120
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
To send a balloon across the Pacific Ocean at the

121
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Disappointments never

122
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Never been done I mean that it's

123
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
Basically an intercontinental ballistic missile

124
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
So they're trying to figure out where it's coming from

125
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
They thought maybe they were being launched from submarines

126
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
Maybe they were coming from beaches in North America from saboteurs there was even speculation at one point and maybe

127
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
They were coming from Japanese internment camps

128
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
In North America

129
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,959
Then two days before Christmas 1944 in Alaska

130
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
A Native Alaskan trapper

131
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Trax wind down

132
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
And it has

133
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
2

134
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Sandbag

135
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Still attached

136
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
To the bottom of string

137
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
And that

138
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
Turns out to be the key to the mystery

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
Sand yeah well that just saying there's a lot in there

140
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,279
My name is Eliza bergslien and I am a forensic geologist we call the police to help us understand this next part what

141
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,119
Was the sand for the balloons was sent to Washington DC

142
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Just some scientist

143
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
At the US Geological Survey right away they discover that there's no Coral so you don't have finding no

144
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
No Coral cold water now they look at the diatoms Marine 5 oz

145
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
Stop at fossil mollusk by compiling all of these different characteristics put that all together

146
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
The other where would you find these diatoms these minerals that you wouldn't find Coral though all those different pieces of information

147
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,839
Altogether the geologists are able to determine that there are

148
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
2 or perhaps

149
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Three beaches

150
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
In the world that fit all of these qualifications

151
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
Where they believe the sand could have come from

152
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
And all of which are on the east coast of Honshu the largest of

153
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Japan's four main islands

154
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
You can get that

155
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Kind of specific from Sandy yep

156
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
That kind of

157
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
Pacific Tree incredible I so they came all the way from these particular beaches on the coast

158
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
6 thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean

159
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Why would the Japanese choose to

160
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
To deliver

161
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Buy balloon

162
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
It's a strange choice

163
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,983
After Pearl Harbor in as like they whenever you know they could be playing

164
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Well

165
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
Iowa temperature history in the making it grew directly out of the Doolittle Raid

166
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
Back in April of 1942

167
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
When is Raiders took off from an aircraft carrier

168
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
Deep in the Western Pacific and drop bombs on

169
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
Tokyo and Yokohama and Kobe and a number of other cities across Japan

170
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,703
In the history of aerial Warfare they didn't do a lot of damage

171
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
Physically but it was such a shock to the Japanese

172
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
To think that their Homeland could be invaded that these planes could actually fly over the Imperial Palace.

173
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:30,623
The home of the emperor and if you little bit holder the palace I just realized that he went all the way down town in Tokyo

174
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
Oh yeah right over the city

175
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,743
And so immediately after the Doolittle Raid and Order went out

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
It was just find a way to bomb America

177
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
Japan's Navy

178
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
TV is stretched so thin at this point in the war

179
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
There's no way they can pull off something like the Doolittle Raid they didn't have aircraft carriers that could get their plane

180
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
Close enough to the US Mainland but what they did have

181
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
What's the wind

182
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Today we call this the Jetstream that name didn't come along until after the war at that point we barely knew about the jet stream

183
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
But

184
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,143
Prior to and during the war the Japanese did an extensive research into these winds Okay so

185
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
In 1924 there's this meteorologist name blah Saburo issue

186
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
And he goes to the top of a mountain

187
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
And he releases a bunch of these

188
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
Little paper weather balloon

189
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
And he discovers that

190
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
At about 30000 feet up there's this River of fast-moving air speeds up 275

191
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
5 miles an hour

192
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
Drink anything and it's Miss pollen insects

193
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
All the way to North America within days

194
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
And after the Doolittle Raid they thought maybe if we were to release a bunch of balloons

195
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
And just the right place at just the right time

196
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Maybe this jet stream of Erica

197
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
Push these balloons across the Pacific Ocean

198
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
Toyota.com

199
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,271
So this is Tesco Tanaka choose interviewed in this independent documentary called on Paper Wings

200
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
America

201
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
In 1944 she said she was a teenager

202
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
When the Japanese military came to the school and basically

203
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,559
Turn it into a factory

204
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
She and hundreds of other school children

205
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Were conscripted to begin making this

206
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
Special kind of paper out of mulberry wood

207
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Called

208
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,823
Handmade Japanese traditional paper

209
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
This is my house Sheena

210
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,735
Who now works at the noborito institute in Japan

211
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
Lottery choir

212
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
12 hour days

213
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Making thousands tens of thousands

214
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Of these sheets

215
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Gluing them together

216
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Why didn't they have adults in the car

217
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
They were all Fighting the War 1

218
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
Young Thug's home good

219
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Full

220
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Stop

221
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,239
Big big girls had a certain dexterity for the neighbor make the Nimble fingers

222
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
I think I read that long

223
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Okay my

224
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
And after they finished

225
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Producing the balloons

226
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
And after the blooms were strapped with bombs

227
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
They were shipped off

228
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
To those beaches

229
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
And

230
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Just

231
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Letgo

232
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
People from the Japanese side watching them take off

233
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Said they look like

234
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,607
Huge jellyfish swimming through a pale blue sky

235
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
These perfectly silent Vehicles the only sound was

236
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
The rustling of the paper is they took off

237
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
How many were launched

238
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
From November 1944 to April 1945 they launched 9000 balloons

239
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Now

240
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
The engineers in Japan who designed this

241
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
Faced a very serious problem once we got the balloons up into the jet stream and they were cruising along their floating it to be

242
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
He's from fifty to a hundred miles an hour

243
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,871
But every night temperatures are going to fall to -40 centigrade

244
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
And the fixed volume of hydrogen inside that envelope is going to contract the balloon is going to

245
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Lose altitude

246
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
Drop out of the jet stream and down into the ocean all together

247
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
So to solve this says Ross they what they did was this

248
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
They took 32 sandbags

249
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
Harlem on the balloon and then connected those sandbags to an altimeter set to a preset minimum such as 35

250
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
Thousand feet in the nighttime

251
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Wind balloon

252
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Loses altitude

253
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
The altimeter

254
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Will engage

255
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Trigger fuse

256
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Which cuts off one of those sandbags

257
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
And dropped it into the ocean and now

258
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
The vehicle will resend back into the jet stream cuz it's lighter cuz it's lighter so these

259
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Balloons the riding the jet stream a 10 every night they start to descend but then off we go a sandbag

260
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
And then go back up and whenever they cooled off enough to drop same thing drop then rise

261
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Drop then rise

262
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Over and over

263
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
32 times until every sandbag was gone

264
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Once all the sandbags have been dropped

265
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Now you have

266
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
Only the bombs remaining and the bombs are held in place

267
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
With the exact same mechanism is the sandbags

268
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
And now by the very same system the bombs are the last to go

269
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
And presumably the balloon is now somewhere over North America

270
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
So it's a sandbag countdown

271
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
30

272
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
29

273
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
28

274
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
4

275
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
3

276
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
21 I hope I'm in Oregon right

277
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,127
In what it was in Oregon or whatever the idea was that it would

278
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Drop its last bomb

279
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Float away

280
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
In basically self-destruct

281
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
They I guess figured it would be it would be more terrifying

282
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,719
They have bombs raining down silently from above with no calling card at all

283
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Then with the Japanese calling card

284
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
Sounds of the last time baggage drop

285
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Not only the central payload is left

286
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,591
This is audio from a declassify Navy instructional video made about these

287
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
Balloon bombs in 1945

288
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Jesus soldiers

289
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
How to what to do if they find one of these bombs and how to Defuse The Bomb

290
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,463
But I think the most interesting thing about the video is this text that's written in

291
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Huge

292
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Block letters

293
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Right at the bottom of the screen

294
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
It says

295
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
Do not eat the Enemy by publishing

296
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
Or broadcasting or discussing

297
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Information

298
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Information

299
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,871
Can be a powerful tool can be a powerful tool for good and a powerful tool for evil

300
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,711
This is Professor Mike Sweeney and I'm a historian of wartime censorship

301
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,831
And he says that immediately after those first balloons landed there are few stories that appear in the local newspaper

302
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Farwest

303
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Stories about

304
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
A Japanese attack

305
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
On the mainland of the United States

306
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
Time in Newsweek even picked it up saying we're not sure what these are but you know are these the Japanese spies coming here

307
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
And on these balloons this a large-scale attack what is going on

308
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
And then

309
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Very shortly thereafter

310
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Just three days after this time and Newsweek article

311
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
The office of censorship initiated a press blackout

312
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
This blackout on news

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,575
They sent out memos in telegraph's to all the major wire services

314
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
So you pdap in the ins

315
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
Saying keep any news of these Japanese balloons

316
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Off the wires and out-of-print any stories about these bombs will have to be approved by the appropriate authority of the

317
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
The US Army if you wish to publish or Broadcast News about

318
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
And why would they want to keep the secret

319
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
So the government's

320
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,151
Ideas about why balloon Bob should be censored in particularly armies ideas were number one to avoid panic

321
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
These things are instruments of Terror right

322
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
You can't be afraid of something you don't know

323
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Exist

324
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Number two

325
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Is avoid helping Japan

326
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,695
It was thought then that if we printed exactly

327
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Coordinates

328
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Particular bomb Landing

329
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
That this would help

330
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Japan

331
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Better Target

332
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
The Bob and the reporters think about

333
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
The gravel sometimes what they complied

334
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Everyone

335
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,871
In the news industry was as patriotic as the rest of the country that is the vast majority of journalists supported the war

336
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Of course if you screwed up

337
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Can you send out a story that got American life skill you could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act for them or can you imagine what your listeners

338
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
We would do if you were the radio station if itis

339
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Killing 100 American sailors

340
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,815
To the newspapers and radio stations kept their mouths shut

341
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Which meant that

342
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Most Americans

343
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Never even heard this was happening

344
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
And more importantly the Japanese

345
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,055
Weren't really hearing about whether they're bombs made it or not

346
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
So

347
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
They probably concluded that it was basically a failed experiment which largely it was

348
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
Of the 9000 released virtually none

349
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Cause any damage

350
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,439
And certainly not any Terror except

351
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
For this one balloon

352
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
That's coming up

353
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,655
Hi this is whale calling from Northumberland England

00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,111
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

360
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,231
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

361
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
And I request

362
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

363
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
About what we're calling tiny moments

364
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,335
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something

365
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kid

366
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

367
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Do you

368
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

369
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the kids in math class

370
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,839
I noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

371
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

372
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Anything to do with the test

373

This is Radiolab with our story from reporters Peter Lang Stanton the Nick farrago about

382
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
The 9000 Orso balloon bombs

383
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,711
Japan sent to America in 1944-45

384
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
Did rain down on American soil and created

385
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Nothing really nothing happened

386
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
No damage

387
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
No Terror

388
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Nothing

389
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
But then we get to this tiny little town called Bly

390
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Tumi

391
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
There's no place like old why

392

Plies the sleepy little logging town at the base of Gearhart mountain in South Central Oregon lot of pretty scenery

393
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,103
Ancora Connor who just heard was born and raised there do you know everybody in your

They're just like a big family out there

395
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,807
In the forties when Cora was a young girl there about 700 people living there but we did all kinds of fun things we had

396
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599

00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:23,584
Who was five months pregnant with her first child Sunday School

411
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
The church took occasionally up there they took their

412
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,752
Sunday school class out for picnic there were five children that went along on that

413
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,360
Ages 11 to 14 and one of the kids we called him Dicky

414
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
He had a crush on my sister who is Billy younger than me

415
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,552
And they want her to come on this picnic so they came by and stop the pastor

416
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,112
That's why I stopped the kids all piled up

417
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Ca Stockton weather

418
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,256
Yeah trying to talk to convince my mom to let my sister go or both of us or whatever

419
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,840
But Mom didn't want us to go cuz Saturday was our chore day

420
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
And my day to work the switchboard which should usually make me pretty angry but it was my job

421
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
And that

422
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,896
She said no. No weight while my sister didn't really want to go because she really wasn't

423
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,992
Encouraging this relationship too much

424
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Educate ya

425
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
No

426
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
So Archie and LZ and the five kids get back into the car they drove up to Gearhart Mountain a couple miles up a Logging Road

427
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:28,096
Passing Forest Service guys working on the road they go a little further to where the road comes near Creek

428
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Can Archie pull the car around

429
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Impart

430
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,776
The kid jumped out of the car and started running down towards the creek

431
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
LC

432
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Who was

433
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
Pregnant as I mentioned that she was feeling a bit carsick

434
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
She jumped out

435
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
To get some fresh air into chase after the kids

436
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,392
While Archie went around to the trunk of the car to get out the fishing poles in the picnic baskets Etc

437
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
One of the children

438
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
Saw something on the ground

439
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
A large

440
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Canvas

441
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,448
White grey balloon of some kind spread out on the ground

442
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
Call of Duty other children to come have a look

443
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
The children

444
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
NLC apparently gathered in a tight Circle

445
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Around the balloon

446
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Archi later reported that while he was getting the picnic basket out of

447
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
The trunk

448
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
His wife called yuan

449
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Honey

450
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Come look at what we found

451
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,280
He turned and just took a few steps toward them

452
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,816
And at that moment

453
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
We'll never know exactly what happened

454
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
But apparently one of the children reach down to pick up

455
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
The device

456
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
The bomb detonated

457
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,104
All five children and Elsie Mitchell

458
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Were killed in

459
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,832
The forest service guys down the road we're close enough to hear the blast they come running when they hear the explosion

460
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
And they see

461
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
Archie Mitchell has run to the site

462
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
And his wife's

463
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Clothes were Ablaze

464
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,144
And Archie was kneeling over his prostrate wife beating up the fire with his bare hands

465
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
On our last day in Bly we went to visit the site where the bomb went off

466
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
The middle of nowhere

467
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
It's just a chain

468
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Fenced off area

469
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
A little pain

470
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
And are these tall

471
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Pine trees

472
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
This is huge cuts in the tree

473
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,776
Is a shrapnel cutting the tree yeah yeah

474
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Assassin

475
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
It's not healed

476
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Erie place

477
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,048
Course I didn't know what was going on

478
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
This is Cora Connor again

479
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
At the time she was at her job watching the switchboard

480
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
When

481
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
The guy that was working up there for the 4 service come rushing into the telephone office and I mean he was

482
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Scared

483
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
Pure White and scared and I thought my God what's going on what's Happening and he came in and made the call

484
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
Elected the naval base in Lakeview in about a half an hour later

485
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Casino

486
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
Big imposing military guy comes in he was all

487
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
Metals and always full uniform you know

488
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,096
And that he must have made it it seemed like in the blink of an eye

489
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
And I thought my God what has happened and then when the he talked over the phone I knew what was going on he said they had had a ball

490
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Explode up there

491
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Let's fight both the casualties

492
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
And then he talked to me he said you not talk to anybody about anything that you've heard

Not your mother not anybody he says now you're not tagged League of this office

494
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
But then I was just

495
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
Jelly I was so terrified

496
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Tea leaves and

497
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,376
The word is is trickling around spreading around town gone wrong

498
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
And they gathered at the phone office because the phone office those everything in the whole valley and they knew I knew what

There is a crowd outside screaming and yelling at me and yeah we know you know what the

Replace I probably knew every one of them I was about that you could imagine

504
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
The state I was in and mr. Paskey Dicky's father

And his red hunting

00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,792

All right he says you know what's happening let us know what's happening

00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Except I set there

517
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
You know I really really

518
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Tore me apart

519
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
That was just in a complete fog for days

520
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Not ever

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Never talked too much about it

522
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
Within a day or so the military told most of the town

523
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
What actually happened that day

524
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
And then a short time after that

525
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,176
A big armies truck while I was too big army trucks and stop right out in front of our house

526
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
We wondered what was going on you know you're

Little town like that anything different everybody goes to the window and takes a look

Okay this is awfully hard

531
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
A woman and a little kid jumped out of the back of that truck

532
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,960
She was Japanese they were on their way to the tulelake

533
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
The Japanese

00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Internment camp nearby

535
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
And she screaming and crying and praying

536
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Please we need water

537
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,016
We need water for it was thought it was really hot that day and they were in a canvas covered truck

538
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Jammed in there

539
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
And

540
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,208
I grabbed the picture of a bucket or whatever was there in the kitchen

541
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
Filled it with water and started out the door by that time they were

542
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Throwing rocks at that lady and her kid

543
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
People in that time we're so terribly

544
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Upset

545
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
And they were throwing rocks at her

546
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
And mom would let me go and I screamed and cried at my mother cuz she wouldn't let me go says you can't go out there they'll throw rocks

547
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
I Won't Let You Go

548
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
And did they stay that's pictures in my mind

549
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
And I pray to the Lord

550
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
To forgive the people that were doing that

551
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Try to

552
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
I can't accept it there's nothing can make me accept what happened

553
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
I thought that was the most horrible thing in the world people could do a woman and child that had nothing to do with the bomb

554
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
Nothing to do with the ward nothing

555
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Still hard

556
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,112
How can people be that way

557
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
It upset me so horribly bad

558
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
What did want to talk about it

559
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
I can talk for 40 years

560
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
It's weird like

561
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Is a kind of weird

562
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
Scary symmetry this whole thing like

563
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
The Japanese

564
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Military

565
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Find crate

566
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Terror

567
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
What they felt after

568
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
So they want to make the situation where I like

569
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,864
Bombs were falling silently from the sky we couldn't even tell where they're coming from

570
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Almost

571
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
The gods were dropping

572
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
But we kept it quiet

573
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
Nobody panicked except

574
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
By not saying anything

575
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
At least in this one small incense

576
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,456
I created exactly the situation that the Japanese military wanted

577
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,784
Me not on the scale that they wanted but like and its effect

578
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,136
It's like a concentrated version of the thing they're trying to create but that's the

579
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
Problem

580
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
That's not a problem

581
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
5 is

582
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
5 is a sacrifice

583
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
What is it

584
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Five six people

585
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
Yeah they're what they were there 125 million people

586
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,728
I think I've been all the more than you can see

587
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
What it would have been like

588
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Listen to the store

589
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
You could see what it would be like if

590
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
If the story had been well-known

591
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
I've Been Told

592
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Person to person

593
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,808
Everybody was looking up and wondering

594
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
With the next

595
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
Strange things coming from

596
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
They wouldn't play with there might have been panic

597
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,232
But those kids wouldn't talk on the boulevard stats

598
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
The choices they would have known

599
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Hey I'm sorry

600
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,352
Jumping here I just know that we don't have Ross much longer

601
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
In order to respect your time

602
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
Separates Randy Mills who worked with Nick and Peter on this

603
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
On story

604
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Before they kick you out

605
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
The only last question I

606
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Out of my listings

607
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
Like why is it that we don't know about

608
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
I've never heard of this

609
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Before

610
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
I don't know Robert Hugh farthest

611
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,392
Sephora nearby quite why the hell is this not a thing we know

612
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,232
I think it's directly an outgrowth of that censorship policy

613
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
At the end of the war the war department destroyed all of the evidence they didn't want these any evidence of these bull

614
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Balloons

615
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
Just out there in general circulation

616
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
This is one of those

617
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Footnotes to the war

618
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,360
That you know at the end of the war

619
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
Just never

620
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,736
People people forgot about something that they didn't know about anyway

621
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Ross are there any more out there

622
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
That is a very interesting question

623
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,488
It's estimated by the war department

624
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
That of the 9000 release

625
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,096
They thought that maybe 7 to 10%

626
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Of the total

627
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Would have survived

628
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
The transoceanic Crossing in arrived in North America

629
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
That's 900

630
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,312
300r confirmed

631
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
As having arrived in North America

632
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
So that means there are

633
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Dozens

634
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Perhaps

635
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Hundreds

636
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
That arrived in North America but we're never accounted for

637
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,624
In the 10 or 12 years immediately after the end of World War II

638
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
A couple dozen of these things were found

639
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,232
Found several in Oregon in 1948

640
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
When in Alaska 1950

641
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
T v

642
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
When an Idaho in the early 1960s

643
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
And then the recoveries

644
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:16,800
Stopped movie where they live like the one in Oregon if you touch them

645
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
Now here's the fascinating path

646
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,992
Last October October of 2014 I kid you not it was ahead of me

647
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
And he stopped and said

648
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,208
A couple of loggers

649
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:39,072
British Columbia who are doing some survey work

650
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,424
The remnants of a Japanese balloon that had been on the ground for 70 years

651
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,472
We definitely work in remote areas and

652
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,568
In general

653
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Down through there are those special days where you where you see things that no one else gets

654
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
This happened just

655
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
A few months ago

656
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
I tell you if you're hiking if you're out in the woods in the Pacific Northwest

657
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Watch where you step

658
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
By the way Google fugo

659
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
But that's the code name

660
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,624
In Japan for these weapons they were called Fujiko F fujio cells of the name of Roscoe his book
