Yeah

173
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
That's when it hit me that

174
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
There is no way

175
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
Did any of this reflects what she would actually want

176
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
I don't know if delusional is a kind word here and if it's not

177
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Apologize but

178
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
If she's delusional enough

179
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
To think that we should get married

180
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Is she delusional enough to think she can fly

181
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
Will she be distraught when I say no

182
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Know and we'll see

183
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Would you jump

184
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
It's my Lord the camera

185
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
And I said

186
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
I'm afraid of heights and I want to go downstairs immediately

187
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
And I felt for the first time

188
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Fear

189
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111

194
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
I think she may be going through something

195
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
And I don't know what I'm dealing

196
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
I'm in over my head

197
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
When Mike called

198
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
I just got on a red eye

199
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
That night

200
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Text Leanne Lantos

201
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Jamie's mom it was my job to get her

202
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
To go back to her therapist

203
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
So that we could

204
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Could get some medication in her

205
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,575
For the end of episode was not entirely surprised that it happened once before

206
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Jamie was

207
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
High school at that time she was not sleeping at night spinning around the room talking.

208
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Non-Stop

209
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,375
About how she had to save Central America

210
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
I'm just asking

211
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,263
Bring up first episode Jamie ended up at a place called The Neuropsychiatric Institute at UCLA

212
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
And she ended up being treated by this guy

213
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Dr. mark deantonio

214
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Psychiatrist

215
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
She was in a very

216
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
Acute manic psychotic state

217
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
I remember being served

218
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Tackled by

219
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
Nurses that actually take my meds because I refuse

220
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,975
Still we didn't know if we would ever see our Jamie again

221
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
You know that was

222
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
That was the scariest part

223
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Everyone around me I think was really really worried

224
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
That I wouldn't

225
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Come back

226
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
But you did come back and it's what brought her back

227
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
That

228
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Is actually the reason

229
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Not so interested in the story

230
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Shortly after she was admitted

231
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
Dr. deantonio told Jamie's parents he know what this is and we know how to treat it he said she's a classic

232
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
A case of

233
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Of bipolar is no question

234
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
And

235
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Did the drug of choice

236
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Is lithium

237
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Which

238
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
It's not even a drug but just

239
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
This

240
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Salt and Heat

241
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Explain to us

242
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
You know that she would need to take three tablets of lithium

243
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
3 tablet

244
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
What's this song

245
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
And it could bring her back when it work

246
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Just remarkable

247
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Memories of like what it was like

248
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
To come back like that

249
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
What you were thinking or what it felt like

250
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
As really hard

251
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
To describe as a little bit of like

252
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
Slow realization of

253
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
I was like

254
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Oh that was a weird thing that I

255
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
I did a week ago

256
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Why did I do

257
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,031
The first time she was actually lucid and coming back

258
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
To herself again

259
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
The first words out of her mouth were

260
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Mom it's not me

261
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
And I just

262
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
That just killed me

263
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Within a few weeks it was like

264
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
The incident never happened so bizarre I mean I felt like he was this thing that's a

265
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Fault that I get to just take three of a day and and that was it

266
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
Only normal dose side effects no issues she went off to college and just like flourish

267
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
It was great things were good for a long time

268
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,551
And then after about six years she said you have been on this pill for six years I've had no problems

269
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
I'd like to go off at why don't we try to go off gradually then about a month after she was totally off lifting

270
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
In Mike's apartment

271
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
Up all night you were so tired just a minute ago

272
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Have you told me I had to leave but now I'm still here aren't I

273
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
Totally manic episode all over

274
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Cuz I am

275
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
Whatever

276
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
One of the things that kind of makes lithium

277
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
That affected

278
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,783
Lithium has so spooky and you hear this from a lot of people that have taken lithium

279
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
How to treat bipolar

280
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
Is it selfish

281
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Is so

282
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Simple

283
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Lithium is

284
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
If a single atom

285
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
This is

286
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Story collider podcast

287
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
He's had some personal experience with psychiatric

288
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Chinese written about

289
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,775
That to me was fascinating that did a single

290
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Adam

291
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Can change

292
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
What we think of who we are

293
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
I mean it's not even

294
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,735
Number three the third element in the table

295
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
What are the simplest atom

296
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
Lights with 3 protons 4 neutrons 3 electrons

297
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
That's a pretty simple didn't matter it doesn't get much it really is

298
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Is it never struck me when I was on Lex

299
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
Cipro or Wellbutrin together when they put me on you know if you look at them

300
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
They look like what you expect a pharmaceutical drug to look like

301
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
Ring of carbon atoms and some other things stuck on the bed and they they look like

302
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,615
Big complex molecules in I'm complex my brains complex

303
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
To take this complicated thing to change

304
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
And then you're confronted with

305
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Justice Adam

306
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
He was found by accident that it works

307
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
It's not complicated to make us

308
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Assault that you did

309
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Still out

310
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
And yet it has the

311
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Profound

312
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
The other thing I know about lithium.

313
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Redis

314
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Profound language

315
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Is that

316
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
You're not just saying

317
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,007
My Mind my personality is being changed by an atom

318
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,103
It's Been Changed by an atom that was created directly in the Big Bang itself

319
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
See how this atom formed in the Big Bang

320
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Goes through whatever it does

321
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
Winding path to come onto the Earth

322
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Gets dug up

323
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
Turn into a pill given to

324
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Someone

325
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
And that changes

326
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Their effect in the world and that to me is just it's this

327
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Profound reminder that

328
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,495
The forces that shape everything in the universe are the same as the forces that are shaping

329
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Who we are and what we do

330
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
And what her identity

331
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
It's possible that these forces

332
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Shape not just the people with bipolar disorder but

333
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
All of us

334
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,551
End up talking to a clinical psychiatrist annafellows who

335
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Told me about these studies

336
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
Huge epidemiologic studies biggest one I think was in Japan owners in Austria when was in Greece famous

337
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
When in Texas

338
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
In which they look

339
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,607
At communities that different levels of lithium

340
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Lithium in the water supply and we're talking about

341
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Tiny

342
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Titanium

343
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Micrograms

344
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Thousands of

345
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
The amount in a milligram

346
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919
If you think of like a pill of lithium what were talking about amounts like 10,000

347
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
I guess the amount

348
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
We're dealing with here

349
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,063
And these studies found by and large in in towns that had a

350
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Tiny bit more lithium in the wall

351
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Suicide rates were lower

352
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
In some cases as much as

353
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,511
30% study which is

354
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Astonishing also shows

355
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
The towns that have

356
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
The highest lithium level

357
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Have

358
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Lower felonies theft

359
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Rape

360
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
And these are

361
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Reputable publisher

362
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Studies

363
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
No peace studies

364
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
Only showing of correlations but there does Italy

365
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Seem to be

366
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Some kind of connection

367
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
How's it doing do they know why

368
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Works in the brain after they know what it does

369
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Essentially

370
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
No

371
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Still kind of a mystery

372
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
One of them but here's mark dantonio

373
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
We know that bipolar disorder involves a defect

374
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Certain part of

375
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,335
It's an area of the brain that has to do with controlling mood

376
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,175
So believe it out there neurons in the brain that

377
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
Keep your mood even

378
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,807
These neurons that do their job by a sort of passing electricity back

379
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,647
4th and that electricity is carried by sodium

380
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
So the whole system is pretty much based on sodium

381
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
Lithium is very similar to sodium so if you have lithium in the Brandon Ron's will use that music

382
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Send lithium ion

383
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Here's what's interesting

384
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Lithium Werks

385
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,847
Just like sodium but not as well lithium is similar nothing properties

386
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
That it can be

387
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
An imposter

388
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
But whatever does it just doesn't work

389
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
That's the key

390
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
So then this area of the brain

391
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,903
The defective area of the brain that makes these moods flip

392
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
On and off so

393
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Intensely

394
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
Doesn't work as well and that stops a bipolar episode

395
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
That's so interesting that maybe it's sluggishness is what makes it

396
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Yep

397
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
Although he says that same trip where can be a sort of sodium and posture

398
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
But slower

399
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
That can

400
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Also causes

401
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,383
Slight Tremors in your hand you can have nausea

402
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
I'm taking affect the kidneys

403
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
The balance of sodium your body is regulated

404
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
Parsley to the kidneys and somehow lithium

405
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Replacing it

406
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Canby

407
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Toxic to the kidney

408
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Which actually brings us back to Jamie

409
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
After that episode

410
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
New York with Mike

411
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,887
In the video she went back on lithium and again she was fine fact for the last

412
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
16 years she's been

413
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Completely

414
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Normal

415
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
But then a couple months ago I went to a new primary physician mostly cuz I'm lazy and I didn't want to go to the Upper West Side

416
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,223
Side to see my other doctor and this doctor basically

417
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Took my blood

418
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Pressure and was like you're going to die

419
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,599
You need to go to the ER for kidney stone

420
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
Or failing and so she suddenly had to make this

421
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Choice that I could turn over

422
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Stay on lithium and

423
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
You know

424
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
Go to dialysis and get a transplant

425
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Or that I had

426
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
And that now would be when I

427
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
What switch that I had enough function

428
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,639
You have you are in the middle of that decision now you feel like or do you feel like it

429
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,015
I think I'm going to switch I think I made that decision it's just that every psychiatrist

430
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Stand New York leaves for August

431
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,391
Because I don't know why but they all disappear for August

432
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
All of August and mine said

433
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
You should probably wait

434
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Just wait until I come back

435
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
But I

436
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Feel like I have a good

437
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Group of people around me I have

438
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
A solid job

439
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
It's terrifying.

440
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Accord

441
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Mania

442
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,407
But I also feel like there are a lot of effective drugs

443
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
And that one of them

444
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Is going to work

445
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Olympia Schoology

446
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Depakote sounds like

447
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
God

448
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
Zac Brown right you're on Depakote

449
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
Ashley was in the middle of that decision Jamie did

450
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
One last

451
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
She actually took a trip to Bolivia

452
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Which is where much of the world's lithium comes

453
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Place you can go and

454
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
Literally see

455
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Massive

456
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Salt Flats

457
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Just covered in mounds of love

458
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
I just wanted to

459
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Experience am I wanted

460
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
To be near them

461
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
So I

462
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
When

463
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,463
It just looks like a hallucination it looks like somebody could not have conceived of this landscape

464
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
You know you have red legs

465
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,327
Send your flocks of flamingos and

466
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Dislike

467
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Long salty expanse

468
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
That goes on

469
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Ever like it's just

470
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
You

471
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Jessye Norman

472
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
Do you go up to a pile and

473
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Put your hand on it

474
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,991
You stand on it and you jump off the pile and lady I was

475
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
Makings kind of lithium angels

476
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
And it was awesome

477
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,815
I know I have to go off of it but I really am

478
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
I mean gratitude is like not even the word

479
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
Feel like this thing

480
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Allows me to be me

481
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
It doesn't Define me but it

482
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Allows

483
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
4

484
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Hino

485
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Functionality and that

486
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Sounds kind of wonky but it's like

487
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Everyday

488
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
I get to work

489
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
And it's because of that like everything

490
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
You know I'm just

491
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
I'm grateful to it for its service I feel like it's done

492
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
Done a lot for for me

493
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,032
It worked so hard to get to me too

494
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
From The Big Bang to now

495
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:51,744
Pretty certain weather

496
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
A sword is made of elements

497
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Do not have lithium which we should say

498
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Only some of which was made in the Big Bang

499
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Some of it was

500
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
Also made me super no one will have one of those coming up

501
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Special thanks to Ben Lilly

502
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Anne Harrington Kay Redfield Jamison seaflo and of course Jamie Lowe

503
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,272
James working on a book about her experiences with bipolar it will be called

504
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Grand Illusions

505
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
This is a song from the band Sylvan Esso

506
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,048
We played them the last story in progress

507
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
And they wrote a song about it

508
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
It's not me talking to

509
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
Compassion

510
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Another Nova on the way

511
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,616
It's not melee weapons

512
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
That was Sylvan Esso with Jamie song

513
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
You want to talk Bang

514
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,752
Hydrogen was there at 0 hundred hours in

515
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,824
The coke colored velodrome of dark matter

516
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
Gases chicken gases and infinitum

517
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Chartreuse

518
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
Deafening birth

519
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
The cosmos cartwheeling

520
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Yellow green purple

521
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
Blue-black in the Spear of night

522
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
First I was a

523
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Star

524
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
Then a stain of water

525
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Then

526
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Kindergarten

527
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,288
These poems by the way come from two events that we held in New York City

528
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,664
We went to a emotive fruition which is a wonderful activation run by Thomas Dooley

529
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
Who is himself a poet he's summoned poets more on the metropolitan area for two nights they came to the Bell House in Brooklyn

530
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
Botanic lab in Manhattan and so far we have heard hydrogen by cerasoli read by Ramsey faragallah

531
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,840
Healing by Christina Quintana read by joniece abbott-pratt and I carried your oxygen

532
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
Upon by David Mclaughlin Road by Sam Breslin Wright

533
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
So next

534
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
I'm going to be three claps

535
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
I don't know if you need that

536
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
Just-in-case mechanic

537
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,784
Okay so a while back we ended up talking to a guy named Eric Mueller who makes a YouTube channel called veritasium

538
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Super popular channel guide

539
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,184
Science and engineering week because he's making a documentary about uranium

540
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,048
And we got to talkin about what happens when you take two protons or neutrons and you just

541
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Putting together

542
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
It's it's absolutely not

543
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,728
And that led to this really interesting conversation about

544
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
The beginning of all that

545
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,640
I feel like a little bit of back story is worth saying here

546
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
One really important thing to know

547
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
Is that combining nuclei

548
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Gives you energy

549
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
He says when you slam two particles together they get squished

550
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
And in the squishing they lose a little Mass

551
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
That

552
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Mask gets admitted

553
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
As energy

554
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
This is equals mc squared

555
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
That's what's happening in the Sun

556
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
So the sun is taking protein

557
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Individual protons

558
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
And smashing them together combined

559
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
And that gives you energy

560
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
The energy of the Sun

561
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
They're lost mask

562
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Is the sunlight

563
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
That we basket

564
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
It was math

565
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
I have never thought of

566
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Light as

567
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,016
Former math that's what a star does he says it smashes little Adams

568
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Like hydrogen together to make bigger atoms

569
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Like helium and then big rats

570
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Like carvana

571
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
Looks like oxygen and every little Collision

572
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
It's doing

573
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Generate some energy

574
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
Which keeps the star going stars live

575
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,656
By this process of sticking nuclei together

576
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Going from smaller nuclei

577
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,336
Making bigger nuclei the heavier the star the more the Smashing and bashing they can do in their core

578
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
A bigger and bigger nuclei

579
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Inform but there are limits

580
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
6 million years ago there was a star

581
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Giant star

582
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
Way to get nurse

583
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:48,000
It was just an Adams

584
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
The combining taking hydrogen atoms and making helium taking helium atoms in

585
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,800
Making carbon making oxygen and as its National is nuclei together it's releasing energy

586
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
Bigger and bigger and bigger

587
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
There comes a point

588
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
We're sticking nuclei together

589
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
No longer gives you energy

590
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,344
And that point is element number 26

591
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,928
Iron once you've formed iron

592
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
If you're a star

593
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,304
That's the end of life as you know it

594
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,472
Is iron iron is incredibly stable one of the most stable

595
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
Nuclei in the universe

596
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,104
Its protons are tightly packed in there until you can't

597
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Force

598
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:40,736
Any more energy out of which means you have a core which is no longer

599
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,600
Going to give you energy you can't cook up anything higher than than the iron

600
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,488
What happened to the star does it just become a big hunk what happens

601
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:58,400
Everything starts to collapse gravity takes over

602
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
By the fact that there's all this energy

603
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Going out

604
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
To the Dead iron-core starts

605
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
Pulling everything back in and if this point all of that stuff which is headed inwards aluminum oxygen carbon magnesia

606
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:14,016
Silicone starts rubbing against each other and it starts getting real hot

607
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
And reel dance

608
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
All of a sudden

609
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
You get

610
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
The supernova

611
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,632
That was the most pathetic Supernova explosion

612
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,288
So even though we know there are no sounds in space for the purposes of your enjoyment

613
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
We present to you

614
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,944
This Supernova here's the beauty of it

615
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Here's the beauty of the supernova

616
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
In the ridiculous excesses of energy that are there in the supernova

617
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:56,256
Explosion the biggest in the universe there is so much energy

618
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
Is you for these nuclei

619
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Which

620
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
Would not form

621
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
Under any other conditions

622
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,008
You know Iron is carbon to form germanium silicon hits oxygen to form

623
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,080
Titanium you start to get all of these bigger elements

624
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Including like gold including the gold

625
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
In your wedding ring

626
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,040
Extreme ridiculous excess of energy to form

627
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Is done

628
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
And what are you left with your left with a giant field of debris

629
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
Carbon and oxygen

630
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,704
Silicon

631
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Helium

632
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,568
Clump together due to gravity

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,176
Together is our sun

634
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Mostly hydrogen and helium in it

635
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,552
It's like 99% of all the mass in our solar system

636
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,160
And then the other trunks other bits and pieces start to come together as well

637
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,816
Outside

638
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
How you get the Earth

639
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
And all of us

640
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,568
This is where we got you so you're saying this is the birth of everything past iron

641
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Exactly

642
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,176
Exactly but I think I can get it for the very first time

643
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,248
Post Supernova like in the in the middle of cycle

644
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
Supposed to whenever you have lots of the whole periodic table herlings

645
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
Through space

646
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
You really do

647
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,960
You can find Eric Mueller most days on his YouTube channel

648
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,080
Veritasium is documentary uranium twisting the dragons tail will soon appear on

649
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
PBS it has already

650
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Pyridium

651
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
Kid on PBS in for some crazy reason

652
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
It passed me by

653
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Coming up

654
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
A story that will make you wished

655
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
The Cold War wasn't

656
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Not me not me I'm I'm happy it's over

657
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,208
This is Hester Fuller calling from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont

658
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,304
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

661
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,128
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

662
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
And I'm here because I need your help

663
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
And I've requests

664
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,648
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

665
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,720
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

666
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Childhood brilliance

667
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,352
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

668
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
It just means you lean back and say whoa

669
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,336
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

670
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

671
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,992
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

672
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,856
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

673
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

674
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Have anything to do with the test

675
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
If you have a story with us

676
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

677
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Record short audio message

678
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Message press

679

Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

680
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Thank you so much

681
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Next Step

682
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
Producer Molly Webster +

683
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Carmen Wright

684
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
K12 lunch

685
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
So

686
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Science

687
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
With my sister's I just always go hashtag science

688
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,528
Cuz they get really sick of me trying to teach the kids science lesson

689
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
#science it okay so

690
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
One of the biggest mysteries in

691
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Biology

692
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
How old am I

693
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
That

694
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
It doesn't seem like

695
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,400
Well I mean like obviously I'm

696
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
Molly Webster who's 32 years old who has lived

697
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
You know

698
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,080
232 birthdays I guess but this is a question of like

699
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
We know that some cells in our body regenerate

700
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
And so it's like

701
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
How old are those cells like how old is my heart right now

702
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
I like how old my eyeball or how old is my nose

703
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
The northwest

704
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
Corner of my kidney

705
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
It's just like you know if I'm 3 years old now I'm 33 years old do the cells in the 32-year

706
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
World are they the same as earn even the same as the one when I was three that

707
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,520
The question that's one of the questions in the same if they're not the same

708
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,848
Because if you understand that then you might be able to look like

709
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:05,248
Salve injuries help people heal faster or fix diseases where cells are

710
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
You don't messed up

711
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,112
Like psoriasis or anemia or ALS or something

712
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,952
Like that but also it just seems so cool to be able to be like oh that's

713
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Chunk of my heart

714
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Is from 1997

715
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,120
My heart is from 1983

716
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
At the party of Robert I would want to meet the original Roberts

717
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,384
Is there anybody who's been here since 1947 I'd love to just say hello

718
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:38,528
And if you just join me in 2015 well that's nice I mean night

719
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,136
One of the questions I've had for a long time is is there a way that we

720
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
Can try to date cell

721
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,792
Until the like we can't really send anything into the body because that can be toxic

722
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
So

723
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
Answer for a long time have been no

724
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
And then 2002's

725
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
This little idea pop

726
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Stop

727
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,360
And it's something called the bomb pulse

728
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,456
Bomb by OMB and impulse

729
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
Pul SE

730
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
To explain

731
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
Forties and fifties we all know this we round way

732
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
Testicle out of atomic bomb

733
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:37,408
The first test with 1945 Trinity test New Mexico a few weeks later

734
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
Atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

735
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
World War II comes to an end the rest of the world just tries to catch up to the US

736
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,608
The Russians

737
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
Then after the Russians British

738
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:07,104
French bull Cold War basically just continues to unspool

739
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
All in all over 400

740
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Atomic test

741
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,992
Schwinn off above ground between 19

742
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
1945 and 1963

743
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Just imagine

744
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,136
If only one atom bomb would be dropped on an American city

745
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
Thousands of persons would be killed instantly

746
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Gnosis sucky time

747
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
Well hashtag Zion

748
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
There's one good thing

749
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Potentially one good thing

750
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Popped out

751
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728
And that is an answer to the question of how old are we

752
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
That somehow came out of the bomb test

753
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Yeah

754
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Hello how

755
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
Let me explain

756
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
Do it so with every one of those detonations

757
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,552
When atomic bomb goes off it would shoot a whole bunch of stuff up into the app

758
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
All these like radioactive elements like

759
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Bcmud

760
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Tony and all these things

761
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
Process that explosion shoots up a bunch of neutrons and then Neutron will crash into nitrogen

762
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Floating in our atmosphere

763
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
And create

764
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
C14

765
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
Do very special type of carbon it has to

766
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
The particles in it

767
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
Now is all that

768
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
Bad radioactive stuff starts

769
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
Falling out of the atmosphere back to

770
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,944
The ground c14 doesn't fall out of the sky

771
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
I just heard a

772
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
Floats there

773
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,136
And what happened is overtime the wind currents

774
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
Carried c14 from these test site

775
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
And just spread it all over the planet

776
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
And the c14

777
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
Which is just totally like normal carbon

778
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Not harmful

779
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
It is bonds with oxygen and it gets

780
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
Sucked up into plants

781
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
And then animals eat the plants

782
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
And then we eat the animals or we the plan

783
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
And then suddenly the c-14 is in US

784
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,296
So we all have like a little bit of the atomic age in US

785
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Maybe I was even born in 1963 so

786
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Why would it be in me that is

787
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,000
Cool thing because it hangs out in the air for a long time so it's

788
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Is actually still up there

789
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352
What does have anything to do with dating anything

790
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Yes I'm about to tell you that

791
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Hey you there

792
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
Yes I am

793
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
I'm principal called

794
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,592
I'm a senior scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab

795
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
Professor of stem cell research

796
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,784
At The karolinska Institute has become nearly 2,000 Jonas is staring down this question of like how do I date

797
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
And a certain point he gets

798
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Together with Bruce

799
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
Because he comes up with this idea which is just l

800
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Maybe we just look up there there's some groups in Europe is one in particular that's been measuring the atmos

801
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,448
Disappear every two weeks since the late 1950s images

802
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,104
Bruce says what the scientist have done is they've taken all of these measurements and they put them into one chart so you can see the

803
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
The amount of c-14 in the atmosphere over

804
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,552
So we we have this basically basically a calendar and I could I could send you a picture so you can see what

805
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,904
See what the graph looks like to see a picture

806
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,304
According to Jonas

807
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
Consadole in 1950

808
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Define with all the bomb test

809
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Victor siburian

810
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
Increase

811
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
A lot of carbon-14

812
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Very dramatic increase that's why they call it a pulse

813
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
And that increase was all the way up to 1963 when

814
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
Historic events in the US the UK and Soviet Union agree to stop exploding atomic bombs

815
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,208
Of an atom Test Ban

816
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
After.

817
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Fragile

818
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Decline

819
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
You know they're just measuring it all the way down so they can just say oh like here's where it was in 1980

820
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,288
Here's where it was in 1990

821
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Mm

822
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
2010

823
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
This right here is the coolest part because

824
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,223
The amount of c-14 in the atmosphere

825
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Any given moment

826
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Is directly reflected in our cells

827
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,671
It's right so if there's like that much

828
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,791
C14 in the atmosphere in September 1972

829
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
And that is going to be mirrored in cells that were born in September 1972

830
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
So it is like this

831
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Totally perfect

832
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Birthday

833
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,151
We can see approximately how long have they been there for 10 years or 20 years or 30 years

834
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
It's like once this idea got out

835
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:33,087
Everlook scientists all over the world were like oh yeah

836
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
There's been a new invention

837
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
It didn't take long to see

838
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
This might be something cool to do

839
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
It came about because they made a big atomic bomb

840
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
So just to give you a quick sense of some of the work

841
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,959
It came out of this I spoke to one scientist I'm Christy sporting and I work

842
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:54,335
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm she was working with Jonas and they figured out how to use c14

843
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
In brain

844
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
I mean first of all the basic question was

845
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Can adult humans make new neurons

846
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,367
She says that for like a hundred years so Dogma had always been that the neurons football movies are the ones who died with

847
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
The problem was she had no way to investigate this

848
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Said she couldn't use it in humans

849
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,511
Even if they were dead humans

850
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,839
Until she figured out a technique where she could like extract brain cells

851
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
To see how much do you

852
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
14 was in there

853
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Yeah exactly

854
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,959
It turns out the next best thing to Human

855
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Is a horse

856
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
Because horses

857
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Khalifa Court cemitas decade

858
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
So every second Tuesday

859
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
I would go out to the local abattoir

860
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Bulova slaughterhouse

861
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
An hour away

862
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
And

863
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
I mean I was a vegetarian surrounded by caucus

864
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
And I would

865
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
Bring the horse's head out to

866
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,671
And I had to figure out how to get the brain out of its head

867
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Wait what

868
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
You actually had to like

869
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:49,631
Cut open the skull and get to the brain yourself I'm in the second time I went I took my boyfriend with me

870
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
It's like I can't do this

871
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
Physically

872
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
They actually had a circular saw

873
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,823
And actually discovered that to the skull

874
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
The barn

875
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
Across the top the noise of the horse

876
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,967
Is quite thin so that was a much easier access

877
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Point

878
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,855
Christ discussion did you ever see your research going that way

879
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
Xidan

880
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
Not at all

881
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,999
But what she saw when she finally moved her research from Horseheads

882
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Humans

883
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Was

884
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Turn over

885
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,631
Which I'm quite Redbox levels of new neurons in adulthood

886
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:27,775
I think once you notice is team show that this

887
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Work

888
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Scientist got excited

889
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
And people started today thing

890
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
And not just cells

891
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
So

892
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Pantages

893
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
The bassline ages we knew before

894
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
14

895
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
Was that the skin was like 14 days old

896
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
Working for Deloitte

897
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
Surface level of your gut

898
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
Skin on your gut I guess was 5 days

899
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,519
5 days even shorter than skin

900
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,103
Does that's like the surface of the intestine the surface

901
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
Yeah that's like

902
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,879
Embassy 14 the the deeper muscle apart of the intestine

903
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
The averages

904
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
18.1 years

905
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,351
15.1 years old big difference between skin 9 years old

906
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,423
That sells was another one that they did

907
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
10 years old

908
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
10 years old

909
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Yeah

910
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
Interesting why would a fat cell need to

911
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
10 years

912
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
Cuz it's perverted George.

913
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
They don't know

914
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,111
Do they know that like what would be one of the oldest part of us

915
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,951
Your your cortex which is like the

916
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
The part of your brain that does

917
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
Like abstract thinking

918
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,815
Or your voluntary movements

919
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
That's as old as you are

920
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Really

921
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
If you want to know one of the

922
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
The oldest parts of

923
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
The oldest cell is probably in

924
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,871
Your pinky part of your brain

925
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Cortical neuron

926
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Will that fit

927
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,455
If I think of myself

928
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
As the stories I tell my

929
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
When you get Alzheimer's and you lose

930
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
Your stories and you lose your mind like people

931
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,463
But the interesting thing though is the hippocampus is where you keep all your memories

932
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
And they saw that your hippocampus

933
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Does

934
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Make a bunch of new

935
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
Neurons in the hippocampus

936
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
That's Jonas recent again

937
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,031
Jets approximately 1400 new hippocampal neurons

938
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Per day

939
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Really

940
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,407
Yeah and then each of those neurons will live like 20 maybe 30 years

941
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,479
So does that mean that the part of Robert's brain where he keeps

942
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
Stories he tells himself that part

943
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
Is being made new every 20 or 30 years yeah

944
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
Strange thing I like your oldest stories

945
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Could be stored

946
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
In baby little neurons

947
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
He's weird

948
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
I remember going to

949
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
The Kyoto

950
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
And it's like

951
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
The oldest most

952
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Temple

953
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
In Kyoto

954
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
It has

955
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
Exactly the form that it had

956
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
Spell hundreds

957
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
If years ago

958
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
But when you walk in

959
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Though

960
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
The walls in the

961
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Floors and

962
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
The roofing live Benrus

963
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
Stewart they can restore toxic over

964
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
And over again

965
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,623
Cuz in Japan what they call old

966
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
Is the Forum

967
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Go to

968
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Athens

969
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
And you go up to the

970
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
The Parthenon

971
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
They're you're standing in the very top

972
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Pericles

973
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
The same

974
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
Same materials

975
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
So I can

976
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
In Greece they believe

977
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
That the original stuff is the

978
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
Is what you preserve and in Japan they don't

979
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
I think it's just the form

980
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:55,391
I was thinking of this thing you're doing is sort of a little bit like that like I was thinking I'm much more Greek than I am Japanese

981
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
Cuz I want to know like what my original cells are fit where they are in me but my question is messing me up more basic

982
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Tickets like why does

983
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
Part of Me guitar

984
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Reborn in

985
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
The other part to me don't like why not all of me

986
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
If all of you is being reborn you just

987
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,639
Crumble into dust

988
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,943
It's interesting because they don't know they said the next

989
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
They said basically

990
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
This question of how old is a cell they said no one was asking everyone wondered this but no one was asking this question cuz they never

991
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Tools to ask

992
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
So now they're just starting to ask those questions

993
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
The problem

994
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
This bump also we've been

995
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,191
Dependent on in the last decade

996
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
To start answering all these questions

997
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
It going away

998
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
Really every day a little more that c14

999
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Get sucked out of the air

1000
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,407
So how much time do we have left teen years

1001
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
It's gone by 2030

1002
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
Give or take

1003
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
So we need to get questions on Sat now

1004
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,111
Because we really are working against the clock for many things we want to look at

1005
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,183
I talked to his Alzheimer's researcher who is trying to figure out life

1006
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,743
The chronology of the disease like when certain

1007
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,607
Like pathologies form in the brain he was come just like I just wish I had a little more time

1008
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
And when I think about this

1009
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,823
Like I think about this on the subway this morning like I was looking around and I was thinking

1010
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,383
Yeah I'm on the L train it's a bunch of like

1011
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,503
30 year old kids or something and I was like these they're all reading or something drinking there

1012
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Expensive latte

1013
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
Like these people are

1014
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
So far away

1015
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
From thinking about

1016
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Cold War

1017
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,951
Atomic bombs or anything like that

1018
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
And they're all walking around just like this

1019
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,791
Secret signal from

1020
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
Atomic. Inside of them and then that little signal is like banging out like now

1021
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
Knowledge about their shoulder in their elbow and their liver in the westside of the liver in the east side of their flavor in like different parts of

1022
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,407
The heart and the fact that it's now going away

1023
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
And how like

1024
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,247
Someone born in

1025
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
20

1026
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
42

1027
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
You just made me really boring

1028
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:08,255
And like they're not going to have any insight into who they are sort of makes

1029
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
Inclined to very peacefully want to

1030
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
No no no no

1031
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,103
Why do you forget all the poisons that it that is not a benign event in Sturtevant

1032
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
Experimental picker-upper that is

1033
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Extra

1034
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Extra

1035
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
Stuff in the air dream what about

1036
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
Only Young Thug play telephone

1037
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,959
With One Sweep of power known by God

1038
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943

And special thanks to Henry druid

1040
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,831
And Mark Levin Happy Valentine's Day magnesium

1041
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,951
I go blind watching you burn magnesium

1042
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
Iodine is cute

1043
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
Sublimates

1044
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,351
And yes I'll put lithium in water to watch

1045
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
Kid Scoot About but my heart

1046
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Belongs to you

1047
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Magnesia

1048
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,871
The hotwife laying the abandoned the slowness of you becoming your own fuse

1049
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,943
Mercury is beautiful

1050
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
But it's you Maggie

1051
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
The way you burn for me

1052
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,951
The way you leave nothing of yourself behind

1053
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
We are flying over Greenland

1054
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,911
Your elbow is too close to mine on the airplane armrest

1055
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
Down there they are X

1056
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:30,079
Excavating uranium from beneath the arctic ice and selling indiscriminately

1057
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Go from here

1058
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
I can only see the white

1059
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
Device sheet

1060
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
Glacier Top Mountain

1061
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
This is an island a fishing rig

1062
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
Colourful houses

1063
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
Cod and catfish

1064
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Stew in tomato cream

1065
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,279
Once I thought every isotope in me

1066
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,303
Is Radio app

1067
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
I make the people who love me sick

1068
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,727
This is a teenage way of thinking

1069
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
But you have

1070
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Uncovered

1071
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
A glowing

1072
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Spark

1073
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
In the pristine

1074
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
Frozen place

1075
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
With Amy

Feeling right yeah

1080
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,311
Coming up we're going to get into an elevator push the button and go down

1081
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
All the way down

1082
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,711
My Mother Does Colwich Chad Nicklaus have

1083
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,831
Hi this is Pilar Castro from Bogota Colombia

1084
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,671
Remind me to put it in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

1085
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,999
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology

1086
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,023
In the modern world

1087
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,327
More information about Sloan at

1088
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Www

1089
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
That's long

1090
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,127
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rhonda and Robert Ulrich is Radiolab in today

1091
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:14,527
Elements

1092
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:20,927
Quit doing it with hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen

1093
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
Anaya TV Emporium into Layman's volume satirist Town lyrics

1094
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,623
Okay so we have this periodic table of elements which is a list of the simplest

1095
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
It's a matter that we know of

1096
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
And it's so theoretically everything that we see

1097
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:01,375
Everything we are is made of the stuff that is in that table

1098
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Blessed with beauty

1099
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
Of the periodic table that it describes everything

1100
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
45 years ago a scientist was studying

1101
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,407
The motion of the Galaxy

1102
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
Beautiful layer

1103
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,271
Spirals better calculations did not

1104
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,599
Plain why the galaxies were holding together and

1105
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
Take a note this got to be some stuff

1106
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:28,767
Why can't see around the galaxies that explain why they move the way they do

1107
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
What is that stuff

1108
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,839
Whatever it is

1109
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
It's not interacting with the matter of our world

1110
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
Hardly at all

1111
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
Otherwise we'd see

1112
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
Indeed why we call it.

1113
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
Dark matter is a dominant

1114
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,199
Massive component in the universe

1115
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,111
Experimental physicist Rick Gates Co

1116
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,719
Did the the stuff you and I made off the United States conventional protons

1117
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
Is the Flotsam and Jetsam of the matter well if it sits cost on a sea of dark matter

1118
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,519
We're talking about in terms of the total composition of the universe you win

1119
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,103
The stuff we made over four and a half percent

1120
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
The other 95.5% is this stuff the Dark Matter dark energy which theoretically

1121
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:28,159
Around if you cup your hands you if you have a dark matter particle in your hand the problem of the challenge

1122
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,487
Is that it is so weakly interacting that

1123
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:37,119
It will pass straight for you and in fact will pass straight through the bed and will

1124
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
I have very little probability ventrac

1125
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,751
What if you get one of these little bastards in Iraq

1126
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
Then

1127
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:54,527
Forget the periodic table then you would meet the most fundamental element of them all city of lead historic

1128
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,463
We're going to tell you about an experiment now this desire experiment and we send our producers and emails and Damiano marchetti

1129
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
Check it out

1130
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,815
Getting is this post it is happening in

1131
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,655
South Dakota in the Black Hills in this little town called lead

1132
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,215
And I've not seen this many trees

1133
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Set alarm

1134
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:20,383
Incredibly beautiful picturesque little town but right near the town as you Crest over this hill

1135
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
That's it

1136
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
You'll see this mountain that looks like it's just been

1137
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
Corn open

1138
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,207
No we we pulled over and we walked over to the edge of this thing

1139
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:41,119
And it was like tearing down into an ancient volcano that's not what I thought it would look like

1140
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
In this town

1141
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,983
There is one of the deepest man-made hole

1142
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
I'm planning

1143
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
That's where the experiment is

1144
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
And it's there because

1145
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,615
Way down deep in that hole

1146
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
It's demonstrable

1147
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
The quietest place in the universe

1148
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,551
That is Kent Myers he's a writer

1149
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,183
Don't make sense in second eroding article in Harper's magazine recently that is all about this experiment

1150
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
And this whole

1151
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,535
I was interested in the idea of these Frontiers at the

1152
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,095
Where are you from

1153
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:18,495
Frontier the movie Fargo

1154
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,335
Jamaican says that this story

1155
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:28,991
It starts off way back in the old west Hardy run to Wild rugged 1874 General

1156
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,063
Custer and crew Custer comes out looking for this

1157
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,367
Gold and finds it

1158
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,695
Gold on the mountains and the rivers and in the dark.

1159
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
Far below the surface of the Earth just like that 10,000 people within 2 years or just invading

1160
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,495
Illegally invading the Black Hills which were of the great Sioux reservation and by 1901 the miners blast

1161
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,895
1500 feet down by 1927 3500 feet down by 1975

1162
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
2000 feet deep

1163
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
To put that into perspective

1164
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
If that's what's up mile and a half

1165
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:06,367
Is a mile and a half

1166
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,439
Imagine 6 empire state buildings going

1167
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,511
Straight down and gold is that valuable that you could put

1168
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,095
That kind of effort and energy isn't that astonishing

1169
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,679
But what happened is that eventually the price of gold

1170
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,751
Drop to the point where the size of the mine

1171
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,615
What's the unsustainable mining 8000 feet down

1172
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Nina forever

1173
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,967
What you go down your price increases your cost increase

1174
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,295
You got a holic further you got to air condition the mine

1175
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:39,135
You got to pump out the groundwater you have to run electrical lines down there you

1176
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
And so in 2001

1177
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,487
126 years of being an operation

1178
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
The mine shut down

1179
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:51,423
Metacritic ghost town I mean did the fear that we were just going to have the whole

1180
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
The whole economy of this

1181
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,263
Part of the country is going to fall apart

1182
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
Barbie

1183
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
As this was happening

1184
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
We saw

1185
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
An opportunity that these physicists realize that this was an opportunity

1186
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,855
I don't like how I do physicists do

1187
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,415
Are mental physicists do they love holes

1188
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
Dwarves

1189
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:23,679
This is where we get to that idea of quiet this experiment needs a kind of quiet

1190
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
That you cannot find on the surface of the Earth

1191
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,871
When you and I are sitting on the surface of the Earth when are acutely aware of it but we are being

1192
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,271
Hit by cosmic rays at a rate that I think really rather amazes people

1193
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
If you simply hold your hand out

1194
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
Three or four times a second

1195
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:48,255
Cosmic ray is going through your off hand and it's going right through it and that's every second

1196
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,119
Say what you want your body is literally bathed in thousands of these every second

1197
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
We are just being bombarded with

1198
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,495
Add in

1199
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,079
Ricky schedule

1200
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,127
Talks about it like being in the middle of a

1201
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
What's the stadium during the Super Bowl

1202
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
And

1203
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
This is is there everybody in this

1204
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Arena's clap

1205
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:17,439
Now just imagine that in the middle of all this chaos there is one person

1206
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Leaning over to their friend

1207
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,767
And Whispering a secret

1208
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,095
Dark matter is like

1209
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
The whisper

1210
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
It'll be lost in the noise we have

1211
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,055
The cut out all this noise

1212
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,151
In order to even come close to hearing

1213
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:43,807
And

1214
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,927
It turns out putting a Mite of rock between you and the lapis's is taking you

1215
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
A lot of the way that

1216
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
Yes the greats now

1217
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,471
Listen to this mine through these massive iron doors

1218
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Down these

1219
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
Long underground tunnels

1220
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,455
Into a room where we met this guy and who are you

1221
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,039
Mike Stone Age grew up in Lead South Dakota I'm the

1222
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
4th generation that's been

1223
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
Hanging around homestake mine

1224
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,487
Mike works at the mine so does his dad both my grandfathers were homestake veterans

1225
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:28,607
Let's get that Mike went to school with and his dad went to school with they work in the mines and my grandmother's

1226
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,143
Father on my desk

1227
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
It was awesome

1228
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
But now

1229
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
Now he works in room where he basically

1230
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,103
Equip scientist with other safety gear and stuff

1231
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
David's Tea

1232
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
Boots and a respirator

1233
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,967
KicksOnFire you want to be able to breathe

1234
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
What you want to hear

1235
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,879
And eventually

1236
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,951
If I'm in this old steel service elevator

1237
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
Little farther

1238
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
Subcage the 41

1239
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
Laura Southgate

1240
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,775
And then we just start rocketing downward

1241
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,479
Ascending

1242
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:22,367
At a thousand feet are ears pop

1243
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:29,023
Wet muddy smell sort of walked up and asked we're dropping

1244
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
All that noise is getting slowly filtered out

1245
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
We're able to

1246
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:43,103
Literally use the rock to absorb these cosmic ray particles after.

1247
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
Donut shops

1248
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,063
Hello

1249
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Thank you

1250
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
And we step out

1251
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,743
4850

1252
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,071
This is a caveman

1253
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
It looks like

1254
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Kate it's got

1255
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,775
A dome-like ceiling and walls that are just

1256
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Carved Rock what is that sound

1257
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
That's the sound of rain coming through

1258
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
A whole lot of Rock

1259
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
Because it's not raining outside

1260
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
It's not raining

1261
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
In the world

1262
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
It's just groundwater

1263
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,487
It's costing over $1000000 a year

1264
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
Just to run the pump

1265
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
The drain

1266
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,607
That why does that give you some $2000000

1267
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Yeah yeah

1268
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
But Rick says

1269
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
Down here

1270
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,775
Like this is the least amount of radiation that we will ever experience in

1271
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
It is quite dramatic it's about 3 million

1272
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
Less

1273
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
Cosmic rays

1274
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
So when you hold your hand out

1275
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
Let someone every few months

1276
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
January

1277
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
Coming for you and now

1278
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
March

1279
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
But that isn't that isn't the end of the story

1280
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
Step inside here the very first step when she even have a nice day turns out that even if you cut out all the Rays coming from the outside

1281
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
Side

1282
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
Are there still Rays coming off of

1283
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,775
You & I we carry a certain amount of uranium and thorium

1284
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
Are these radioactive elements in

1285
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
So

1286
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Okay

1287
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:25,759
So what we're going to do is you're going to take your coverall saw Robin barland made us change clothes

1288
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
Do you know

1289
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,295
Yeah

1290
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Scumbag stuff

1291
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,135
Oh the microphone

1292
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
Okay

1293
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,535
And then bring Texas into the Labyrinth experiment happens

1294
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
If this all white room

1295
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,863
What is huge tank metal

1296
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:46,495
Tank contains 70000 gallons of high purity

1297
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,175
Water and was directly inside at home we can without fear of disrupting experiment

1298
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,223
Experiment actually happens inside this

1299
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,039
Bang the outside of it

1300
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
Steel container

1301
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
The whole idea is that this water like she still trout even more radius

1302
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,487
That makes it very quiet

1303
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
Not quite

1304
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,327
And so inside that tank of water

1305
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375
April even smaller tank

1306
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,959
The element xenon about a third of a ton of liquid Xenon

1307
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:22,335
Where do we find Xenon on the periodic table where it what is his seat on this number 54

1308
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,919
It's over on the right hand side so that we have this

1309
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,967
Imperial

1310
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
Named

1311
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:33,343
Set of elements week-old a noble element mean they're just too good for everybody else they interact

1312
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
Hardly at all

1313
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:39,231
That's right you really struggle to make Xenon interact with with any other atoms

1314
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,839
Which is just another way of saying that inside of this tank of xenon which is inside of the tank

1315
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Water witch

1316
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,703
Down in one of the biggest holes ever dug by man

1317
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,007
It is really really really really

1318
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
It's the monster

1319
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
The quietest place in the universe

1320
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:02,015
When you can't preview you don't know that it is because there could be somewhere some quieter place but as far as we know it

1321
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,831
The center of Des Lux detector is the

1322
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
The quietest place

1323
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,927
We human beings now

1324
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,511
And what's supposed to happen inside the super quiet Xenon

1325
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,815
Space City idea

1326
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
So you have here is that this

1327
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,375
Cloud of xenon

1328
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
It's just

1329
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
Waiting

1330
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
And the thought is that when a dark matter particle

1331
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,103
That's like zooming around all the time when that zooms through this see.

1332
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
Because it is so quiet in there

1333
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
Because there is nothing else happening in there

1334
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:35,295
That dark matter particle even though it's not supposed to interact with anything from our world

1335
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
That particle

1336
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,367
If it disturbs

1337
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,463
Is it nudges in any way any of the atoms of the Xenon

1338
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Will notice it

1339
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
Not tiny little disturbance

1340
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
Whatever happened

1341
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Fences

1342
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
You can think of that moment

1343
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
Is the universe whispering

1344
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
The Whisperer in human nature

1345
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,567
The Whisper is a point where we really

1346
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,127
We really want to speak

1347
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,919
Intently

1348
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,479
Do I single person we whisper

1349
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
When when

1350
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
And we whisper

1351
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
Funerals we whisper in the presence of

1352
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,391
Awesome things in nature we

1353
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
We

1354
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,815
Use of the voice that drops down

1355
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
Town and drop starter only goes into the ear it's intended for it's it's Isaiah

1356
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:31,359
Is call you know he's lying on his mad and he hears the whisper because he knows that for me alone

1357
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:35,455
That calls for me alone and that's that's that sense

1358
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
Get this experiment gives to me is it here the universe has been shouting and shouting

1359
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:52,095
Scientific knowledge out of the shop out of the Clapping out of the cheers and now liver

1360
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,167
At in the 21st century is

1361
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:01,567
We're going down to what's it saying in the whisper and those Whispers Goku

1362
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
Clear back to conception they go clear back to birth if we understand

1363
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
These Whispers

1364
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,575
Were very close to understanding

1365
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Gestation

1366
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
And end

1367
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,743
I got carried away there but we love Italy

1368
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Yeah

1369
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,583
Okay and did you get to hear

1370
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
The

1371
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,911
Whisper see the disturbance whatever it is

1372
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Did you meet the dark matter

1373
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:34,335
Well how can I give this to you lightly so this is confession time I've I've

1374
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
Been looking for.

1375
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
27

1376
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Yes

1377
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:42,015
And so far we have yet to see a convincing

1378
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Satta

1379
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Interaction

1380
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,599
Stop mattering

1381
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,135
That's getting that nothing

1382
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,463
It all nothing but Rick hasn't given up hope

1383
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,351
I mean he's heard never gives up hope he says maybe we just need to build a bigger more sensitive to text

1384
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,911
That's exactly what we're doing

1385
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
Instead of their current one

1386
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Which has the third of it

1387
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,287
We are now designing and building a detector

1388
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
Cuz it's going to be 10 top

1389
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
Says even there

1390
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:14,015
Who knows the uncertainty we have to deal with his is is at least a factor of 10 million

1391
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135
10000

1392
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:23,743
Antoine TV the other pretty disappointing thing is that when you're in this room

1393
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,023
Like in the room with

1394
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
The Lux detector

1395
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,607
Supposed to be the quietest place in the universe

1396
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:34,495
Loud it's crazy loud

1397
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,055
There's sounds that I can only describe is

1398
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Robot

1399
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
Dying

1400
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,207
Was there any moment that was quiet

1401
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,511
Like YT quiet like deep quiet

1402
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
Philly quiet

1403
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Well

1404
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
Sort of after we went Deluxe

1405
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
I have some time to kill and they took us into the wrong part of the Mind where these to mine for gold and they just

1406
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,807
Walked us through these old tunnels

1407
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:26,207
And you're you're walking through the black and all you hear is like the sound

1408
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:32,607
Catching the wind speed suck down

1409
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
The silence it's it's not like it's not like the science of like

1410
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
Show the street is really quiet outside of my bedroom it's got like an energy to its like

1411
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,607
It's kind of like when you're running and when you stop running and

1412
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:11,007
Absence of your exertion to refills you it's like that moment where the absence of the noise sort of becomes

1413
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
Palpable and that's for me

1414
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,807
The moment not standing in the laboratory for me that moment with moment right now I am standing at the center

1415
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
A busy not I don't think I ever ever have felt that

1416
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:59,391
Producer Damiano marchetti and Annie Mills almost a year and it's been

1417
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:02,975
Poodle pleasure he's moving on but we wish him

1418
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,071
Would you like to wish him I wish him quiet with the good kind of quiet

1419
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
Anaconda has energy

1420
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,543
You know the won't won't won't my second thank you.
