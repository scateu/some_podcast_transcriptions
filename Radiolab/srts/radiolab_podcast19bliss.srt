1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Play a podcast that we made back in 2012 this is a show that I believe has disappeared

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
The RSS feed

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
And I thought we bring it back because it

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Captures

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
A Feeling

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
But I think maybe we all need a little bit more of these

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Restart

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,800

Yeah I know

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296

You were so enthusiastic so I left just I need to talk to this guy really mean it

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
Alexander Gomez

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
Gundam are you Norwegian all the way back

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Typical noise

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,704
Yeah if typical includes things like in Sahara and

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Climbing

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
Things like that he's going to be a professional

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Adventurer

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,944
And we got the studio because he made a video last year on one of his trips

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,272
Get to this video then it's it's maybe the most

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Amazing

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
Internet video I have ever seen

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
I think so too

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
So let me just set the scene for you okay

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
What you see in the video is this guy Alex

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
Moving along this

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
She's on skis

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,656
Snowy snowscape

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
He's filming himself

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
The camera is right hand where is he

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Antarctica

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Herpes on a 3-month track

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
The South Pole and back by himself

40
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
What he's been doing is every couple of days on his trip you know every 200 kilometers is so he would bury stuff in the snow

41
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
Some fuel and

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
And sometimes a little bit of gear that I did

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
Was that just to lighten your load

44
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Yeah cuz every outside

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
I need weight

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Has to go

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
In this video

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
It's day 86

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Almost 3 months since I left

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
3 months of working 10 hours a day and I lost

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Almost win

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
25 kilos

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
55

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Exhaust

56
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Shut up

57
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Come upon his last cast

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
So

59
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
On the Lost

60
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Cash

61
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Where this

62
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Video is captured

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
What you see is Alex Neal in the snow start today

64
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
I'm telling that I'm quite hungry

65
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Whatever is in this last cash in the snow it's been 3 months since he buried it so I didn't really recall what was there

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Mobile home

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
You up to something good

68
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,200
So he digs up his bag of stuff starts rifling through it

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Vaseline

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
Zinc ointment

71
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,488
Nothing new trash

72
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
But then

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Double pack of cheese Doodles

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
And then this is this is my favorite part he's just

75
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Reese's

76
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
And he's staring off into the distance almost like

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Did that happen

78
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Is it real

79
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Seatac to Dixmoor

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
And then

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Schutz chocolate bars milk chocolate

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Just like you think cementos

83
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
I find more and more and more

84
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Have you ever been that happy in your life

85
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Well I've been thinking about that

86
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
How when did you shout last time you were

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
So happy

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
I think that's why we've been watching this video over and over again

89
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,207
Because none of us can remember what stands between you and that feeling is it really

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Fremont's with hunger

91
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Actually I think the reason I liked

92
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
This video so much is not just

93
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Is it happy

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
City somehow

95
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Stumbled into this moment

96
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Perfection is just like a person

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Situation

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
By being so tired and so hungry

99
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
I'm finding such a stash of candy that he had forgotten that he left

100
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
He created a moment of just

101
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Absolute complete

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Bliss

103
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Is this hour on radio that we're going to be searching

104
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,191
Free moments like Alex Hanna in Antarctica we're going to be

105
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Searching for Bliss

106
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
List of all different sorts

107
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,431
Perfect moments for the world's slips right through your fingers

108
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
And the kind of bliss

109
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
It just might last

110
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
At last

111
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,511
Just before we go to the first story in this episode

112
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
I want to mention that this

113
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
Flower was produced by guy named Tim Howard

114
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
2

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
Was a longtime producer Radiolab and then went on to become the editor of an amazing podcast

116
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Reply all

117
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
And ask him

118
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
What occurs to use you as you listen to it again

119
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,783
There's this moment that jumps out at me where you here

120
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
This woman Shirley McNaughton

121
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Who's like

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
You know key character in

123
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
In the story

124
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
She just radiates

125
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
So much generosity and love

126
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
And

127
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
I just find it so freaking moving

128
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Like

129
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
She goes through a lot in the story like

130
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
Like she she really is just like

131
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Challenging

132
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Incredible in

133
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Kind of impossible ways

134
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Did I think would turn a lot of people really bitter

135
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
And

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
And I wonder how I would react in the end

137
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
With everything that she went through if I went through it myself

138
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
And it's really

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
It's really nice to actually think about that

140
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Like how I would deal with such

141
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Such an incredibly child

142
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Situation

143
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
And

144
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Could I myself

145
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Keep such like

146
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Love

147
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
And admiration

148
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
For this guy char

149
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
And I I just find it so

150
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
So inspiring that you

153

As I listened back I was just like men I just feel so lucky that that that I

154
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
That I got a chance to talk to her

155
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
I don't know that's

156
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
Not a pledge drive you but it but honestly that that was like a

157
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
You can't hear is that original story it begins with a box

158
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Send you got a rectangular

159
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215

Inbox

161
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Doesn't look like much

162
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Just about like

163
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
15%

164
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
10 / 6

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
Singing and playing to friends in America

An amazing character and that's Richard but you do a he's a fellow gave me the

169
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279

La Jolla Shores

175
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591

You so lovable character simple set

178
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Explain why we're talking about this

179
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Because these types tell

180
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
An amazing story about a guy who really embodied his name

181
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
And he tried to save the world

182
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
But ultimately

183
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Try too hard

184
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,751
The turning point in my life

185
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,103
We can start story here this is from a lecture that he

186
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Gave

187
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Decades later

188
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
So The Story Goes it's 1908

189
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
And he's a little kid living in what's now the Ukraine

00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
And his name is

191
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Carl

192
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,439
Blitz not terrible but not Charles with Carl Blitz bli

193
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
TZ

194
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
That's his original name

195
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Endive

196
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
Little Carl was fascinated by Tales of Discovery in adventure my name is

197
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,543
Is Erica ocrant Erica wrote about Charles Place in this great book called

198
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,871
Getting back to the story one day she says when Carl was 11

199
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,479
A lecturer came through town about some

200
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Expedition into explorers talking about their track across the North Pole and he was so inspired by

201
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,231
Like what he saw and heard it that lecture did even decades later he couldn't talk about it

202
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Without getting choked up

203
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
My father took me to this election

204
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
I'm glad I show

205
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
Bullet Journal

206
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,783
And when the ice and snow

207
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Checking this

208
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
For what

209
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
Bring idea as he tells it on those tapes

210
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
That was the beginning of his big idea

211
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
That was going to change the world

212
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Fast forward a few years

213
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
They came together

214
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
After the first girl who did end up going to the Technical University of Vienna

215
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
Give me the best mandolin player in Austria at one time

216
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,527
I played the fool Opera Orchestra

217
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
So sweet

218
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
And then

219
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Everything changed

220
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
In 1938

221
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Nazis came to town he was sent to Dachau and then boom

222
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Innovate concentration camps

223
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,663
Feeling groovy xi'an desire to end my life

224
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
All around him people were being worked to death or outright exterminated but his wife Claire

225
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
Was a German Catholic with connection

226
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:11,231
Play My Good Vibes in my guitar into the concentration

227
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
I became so famous among two notches

228
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
The princess is coming to our but I can say this

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
And you can say that it was

230
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,639
Here in buchenwald that Karl started to develop his ideas about language

231
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,199
By the ways that you can manipulate word

232
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
For instance there was this one song that all the prisoners say

233
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,159
The saddest lyrics in the world

234
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:45,791
At a certain point Carl started to play around with this song you know he'd swap out something sad lyrics for some jokes

235
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
Sing it for his fellow prisoners

236
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
And forgot for a few minutes

237
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Study Island

238
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
And there was terrible on the flip side

239
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
Outside force him to stand there in the cold in front of these loud

240
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Speak and listen to

241
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Speechless speeches of Hitler and Goebbels screaming Nazi slogan

242
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:19,071
Like Germany above all

243
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Which makes you mad

244
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
But after about a year his wife

245
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,919
Somehow wrangled of a British visa for him and he gets out

246
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
Thank heavens shows breakfast times

247
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
And now I can play

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,623
And improvisation as it comes into my mind

249
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
In 1939

250
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
He went to Britain

251
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
As a manager of a factory arrived in England just as

252
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
The blitz Begins the Germans start to bomb every major city in England

253
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Did you hear at the moment is the sound of an air raid siren every time you'd introduce himself to somebody new

254
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Shutter

255
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
That can't be your name because I like Blitzkrieg good attitude

256
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,207
Trainwreck blitz so I change from the wall light switch

257
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
To the peaceful

258
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
That was how he became

259
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Charles

260
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,959
Bliss bliss has all the right Association so he went forward with the feeling of

261
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
That he was now Bliss and

262
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Would bring happiness to the world

263
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,407
Or later he and his wife end up

264
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
China in Shanghai where there was a big population of

265
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Excel choose

266
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,111
Shanghai was the only place that would take them at the time

267
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Apply lifetime

268
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Now we come to his big idea

269
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
I realized

270
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Did the Chinese have

271
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,079
He became enraptured by the Chinese writing that he saw the Chinese symbols

272
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
In each symbol is a word

273
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,711
Any rights about having this Epiphany when he saw the Chinese symbol

274
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
Format he saw that the Chinese

275
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Written form of

276
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
Man sort of looks like a man that looks like a stick figure man

277
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Adam means man

278
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,535
He doesn't even know what the Chinese word for man is he doesn't know how to stay mad but that doesn't matter

279
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
He is

280
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Skipping the word

281
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,191
Then going directly into the meaning so here was a way of getting Beyond language

282
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,823
You could think the word in any language if you see it in the symbol that was a revelation

283
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Why

284
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Well

285
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
I'm you think back to the concentration camps when they were outside in front of those loudspeakers listening to Hitler

286
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Saying stuff like

287
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Deutschland Uber Alles

288
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
You know Germany above all

289
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
That phrase

290
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Charles new

291
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Did it actually predated the Nazi

292
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,959
Earlier in 1848

293
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
And originally it was meant as a rallying cry to bring together all the separate principalities

294
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,455
That spoke German but these were not one country

295
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
So when they said Deutschland Uber Alles

296
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,575
Event unification

297
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,671
Venetian above the state's us it was an Australian aggressive

298
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
But

299
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Hitler change the meaning

300
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
Instead of the nation above all states

301
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:37,471
He changed it to the nation

302
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:43,103
See see what happened this phrase that started meeting one thing unification

303
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Can the Alps

304
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Yeah

305
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
This is what the Nazis did

306
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
It would been words to obscure the truth of what they were doing

307
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Extermination

308
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
The college solution

309
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
By doing that

310
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
As he saw it

311
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
They were able to convince

312
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Good

313
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Same people his neighbors

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
To go along with the genis

315
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
Then I realize that something must be done

316
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
To make language more to it to Nature words were the problem words made people do cruel things

317
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
To each other

318
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,295
Fort dangerous instruments

319
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
So when he saw the Chinese symbol for man

320
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
He thought

321
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
This might be the answer

322
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Chinese symbols but even clear

323
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,959
Picture so simple if he could sit down and work it out

324
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
You would look at the symbol

325
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,407
And know what it meant instantly regardless of what language you spoke you wouldn't even need words which he felt could be eaten

326
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
Manipulated you could just have the symbol and get straight to the the truth of the matter and the way he saw it right off

327
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
About you have all of these Bennett

328
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
English women historian

329
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:08,095
Would you have the window everything from traffic accidents to health problems could be avoided he thought

330
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
Thought his symbol system would just be adopted he had this Vision that high-level political and Commercial Legos

331
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
Associations would be done in symbols did he say anything as Grand as like

332
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
War wouldn't happen constantly

333
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
And even of course

334
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,319
He reckon Hitler wouldn't happen basically that is the German people understood with symbols

335
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
They wouldn't have caught

336
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Google's propaganda

337
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:38,047
That's a pretty tall order but it did seem to be what he thought everything could be cured by the system he's a biggest Dreamer

338
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Ever

339
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,167
How did he go about doing this he started working out with the basic

340
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
Lines and shapes would be he also wanted to make sure you could produce it with a typewriter so it had to be a limb

341
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Limited set

342
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
Of shapes out of which everything could be created

343
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
Okay so he works on it for 7 years 7 years and he comes up with

344
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
That wow that is a big way this massive book called

345
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Listen bollocks

346
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Samantha ology

347
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Illogical writing for an illogical world

348
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,631
Explain the logic of his system for example here he was a symbol for sword which

349
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Looks exactly like a sword

350
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
And then

351
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
Sword plus it Forward arrow means attack

352
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
I buy it

353
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,383
And then if you see a symbol for sword and another symbol for sword

354
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,175
In the cross that means war

355
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,271
Just the idea that you take these basic Elemental symbols and combine them exactly

356
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Here's another one

357
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
This symbol here

358
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
Is like the top half of a circle

359
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Like a little Rainbow

360
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
That means mine

361
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Mind it looks like the top of a skull

362
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
Now if I were to take that

363
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Symbol for mind

364
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
An hour to go like

365
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
This her to put

366
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Inside it

367
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
?

368
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
That means

369
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
I don't know or I know

370
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Doubt

371
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,199
And they're all so you know ways indicate adjectives

372
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
First person second person

373
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Pass

374
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
The future but

375
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
How did the one thing that it did that no other

376
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
Language arts symbol system or anything is attempted

377
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
To do

378
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
At least as far as I know

379
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Is that it would

380
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
Make clear when something was

381
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
What he called human evaluation you know basically an opinion

382
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
What you do is you put this little

383
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
Does Little V symbol and you put it above this symbol

384
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
And wife wifey well because you know how heavy is balance on a point and unstable at wobbles to him

385
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
That represents

386
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Opinions human evaluations anything that comes out of mine

387
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Take metaphors

388
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
If you say something which is the top four

389
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
If he says

390
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
You must put up

391
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Timothy wheeler the reader

392
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Do not

393
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Take this literally

394
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Without further ahead

395
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
Not exactly bulletproof but

396
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
I can I can see

397
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
See the thinking there I actually think it's pretty impressive

398
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Ben

399
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Okay so what happens next

400
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,151
Well after he finishes this and he and his wife are living in Australia.

401
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
They spent all their savings on producing this book

402
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
And sent it out

403
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Two professors

404
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,879
Government officials heads of state like 6000 people

405
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
And

406
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
They waited for the orders to start rolling in

407
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
And

408
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
No response

409
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
From anybody

410
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
And then they had nothing

411
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Can't say I didn't see that coming

412
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Yeah and

413
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
With great

414
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
Disappointment Charles went to work

415
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
Cuz a welder in a factory

416
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
The General Motors Holden

417
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
He was working on the production line

418
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Almost is a robot

419
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
And a year later

420
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
His wife died

421
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,095
You know he had fought in World War 1 had been in a concentration camp had lived in Exile

422
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
But he says this was the lowest point of his life

423
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,055
Until one day 1971

424
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
As he said this letter floated onto his desk

425
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,015
With this picture of this beautiful dimpled child

426
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Proudly

427
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
Using his symbols

428
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Yeah it

429
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
I it was a poster a poster

430
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Upholster

431
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
This is Shirley Shirley McNaughton and at the time she was a nurse at a place called The OCCC

432
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Ontario crippled

433
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Children's

434
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Center

435
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
A name that we

436
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
We're very happy to leave behind us

437
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Matt Davidson

438
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,664
Changed my name I started there in 1960

439
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,504
8 truly was part of this group of teachers and nurses

440
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
Worked with these kids who suffered from cerebral palsy

441
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
If you have cervical palsy it's the motor control

442
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
From the brain that's been effect

443
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
Which meant that they had trouble moving their arms or legs

444
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
And even in some cases

445
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
They couldn't speak

446
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
They couldn't form word

447
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
And in a film that was made of this class

448
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,056
You see these young kids

449
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
Children from 5 to 7

450
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
I'll sitting in wheelchairs

451
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
They're watching the teacher

452
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
Talk to them and you hear them try to talk

453
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Her

454
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
But they can

455
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
These kids had no way to communicate

456
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Can they learn how to read

457
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,864
They could if you knew what they were understanding and they have no way to communicate that to you

458
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,984
The only thing all these kids had we're pictures that they could point at they had a picture of a

459
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
Toilet picture of food picture of a drink a picture of a bad

460
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,664
They were limited to that kind of communication

461
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
But I knew they were bright

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,832
But it's a good move and they couldn't speak how how would you know

463
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
Inside on that was the twinkle in their eyes

464
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:57,792
But she says a lot of doctors and nurses at the time I thought I was crazy. There really wasn't much going on inside

465
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,960
You know they thought I was projecting into the children what she needed she said was a way to get through to them

466
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,544
So one day she was at the library with a colleague and

467
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
They come across this

468
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Dusty old volume that had never been checked out

469
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Called

470
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
You guessed it

471
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
The symbolic

472
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
And what did you first think when you saw it oh boy I can I get back to the group how fast to the group with

473
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
Is exactly what we need

474
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
So do you remember what the first symbols were I think it was I

475
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,864
DUI looks kind of like a standing person upright line

476
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
Small horizontal line at the base

477
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Next to it

478
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,056
The number one which means first person use the same symbol but with a number 2 for a second

479
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
And then they had to have a verb

480
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
And with love

481
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
Heart with an arrow through it so now they've got a sentence I love you

482
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
One of our mothers that's the happiest moment she's ever had with her child was wondering child came home and said I love

483
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
View you know self

484
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,632
Shirley and her staff started to add more symbols but they caught on

485
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,496
And pretty soon they'd created this giant laminated chart it had died

486
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
And you and he she we

487
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
And they then it had mother father grandma grandpa doctor nurse teachers therapist most men firemen

488
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
Library dentist eventually they added adjectives happy sad and frustrated all the verbs

489
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
You had loved and by

490
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,208
And he wants needs understand

491
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Pretty soon the kids

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,864
Started to do amazing things with symbol combinations we started improvised

493
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
Charlie remembers asking one kid

494
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:46,080
Terry Martin what did you want to be for Halloween Harry pointed first that the symbol for creature

495
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Creature

496
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Not a person

497
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
Then he pointed at symbol for

498
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Send

499
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
Blood that night

500
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Creature who drinks blood

501
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
At night right he wanted to be a vampire

502
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
He spells a new word

503
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
It sounds like an explosion

504
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
With these kids

505
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
It was

506
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
It was

507
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
For the first time she says

508
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Actually

509
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Talk to them like

510
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,984
Know who they were you got to know who the leaders were

511
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,056
In the classroom those who wanted to help others

512
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Those who

513
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Copy. Others

514
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,200
And it was around then that she and the other teachers decided to send Charles Bliss

515
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
That letter

516
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
We were sharing our excitement

517
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,160
For this gift is given to the children you know he was in Australia if he was an elderly man we had

518
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
No thought that he would come and visit us

519
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
But Charles bless he was delighted

520
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,472
Infinite baffle for cilantro recognition

521
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
And now he had it

522
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,128
Three mortgages house flies over

523
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
Dances around and kisses everybody effusively

524
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
Your long conversations with the kids in symbol

525
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,976
He was very happy about

526
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
The children

527
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Joy

528
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
But somewhere along the way

529
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Pinotage

530
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,568
Shirley Shirley in the teachers had begun to

531
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Augment

532
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
They be going to add their own symbols

533
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Such as the opposite meaning

534
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Symbol

535
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
This allowed the kids to take one of us a standard symbols

536
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
Invert the meaning opposite of happy sad

537
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Opposite of Uptown

538
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,328
Vivian out this would effectively double the number of adjectives

539
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Switch would be great for the kids and

540
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
We developed rules for adding combined symbols for how to be more precise with the symbols

541
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Pronouns that were missing the difference

542
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
Between he and him and his

543
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,944
In short I would make the adaptations I needed to me

544
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
From the very beginning we were using it

545
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
To meet the children's needs

546
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Therapist

547
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Specifically

548
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
And of course that is not what he had in his mind

549
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
He wanted a system that was

550
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Universal

551
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Every change that she made

552
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Created like a

553
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
Separate dialogue

554
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,704
She would get very emotional about it. When he got back to Australia he started writing all these letters

555
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Basically taking issue

556
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
With her changes and

557
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
Her failure to understand how his system work

558
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Meanwhile

559
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,504
Thanks to Shirley worried about bliss's Temple's head Spread Way Beyond Canada

560
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Too hungry

561
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
France

562
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Sweden

563
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
Israel

564
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,488
Zimbabwe

565
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Zimbabwe and then Argentina Brazil Finland Iceland Italy Bermuda Guam Japan Portugal Spain

566
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
Netherland Hungary Switzerland Venezuela Madagascar Yugoslavia

567
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Fidelity places yeah

568
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
And in each place

569
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
The symbols would inevitably get tweets

570
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,016
To suit that country for example in Israel cuz the writing goes from right to left you the blissymbols 1/4 Mile

571
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,856
But what really pained him the most what really got him

572
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
Was it these teachers were using his symbols as a step toward

573
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,328
English or French or German or Hebrew or whatever it was just a way to get the kids

574
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Two native language

575
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,728
The teachers always saw it the way they saw it you start the kids on Bliss and then you introduce

576
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Reading and letters and eventually they're fully literate or with point

577
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
You don't need the Blessed symbol

578
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,944
This was the ultimate insult them

579
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
They're using his system

580
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
To bring these kid

581
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Back

582
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
To the very thing

583
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
That he was trying to get

584
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Everyone

585
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Away from

586
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Evil words

587
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
If I try to explain it today

588
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,424
I don't want to listen to me then looks roomie

589
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,288
That's right about this point in the story

590
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
That you start to hear

591
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
A different Charles

592
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Shannon McNulty

593
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Hess

594
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Who sang perverted

595
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Yeah

596
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
She smiles

597
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Shibaguyz and she lies

598
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,024
He kept sending Shirley and the other teachers letters and the letters got angrier and angrier

599
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
This was not with the language was for this was a universal language that had nothing to do with spoken language you are

600
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,240
Are ruining my system you are abusing it

601
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,312
Eventually he decided to take matters into his own hands

602
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
And he travels back to Canada

603
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504
And he started going to the various centers where the kids were using his symbols and saying horrible things about

604
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
About me

605
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:48,672
I'm getting them very upset that's when I got upset I got upset when he got them upset not long after

606
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,000
Shirley received a summons

607
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,632
He sued them

608
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,496
Misses jelly mcnorton on the tapes even suggest that he's going to have Shirley put away

609
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Pro-life

610
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
4life

611
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,128
Why was he so upset with her in particular

612
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,736
Well because by this time she started the international organization

613
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,064
BCI with symbol Communications International

614
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
And you felt like

615
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
This was

616
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,952
The total unique and in powerful tool which could

617
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:27,840
Could and should transform lives around the world and more teachers needed to adopt it definitely

618
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,960
What was he asking for did he wanted us to use the symbols in his way

619
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,592
So 1975 the bci-1 a license agreement to use the symbols in the workbook

620
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
It's for the kids

621
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
But Charles Bliss

622
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
They should all be fine

623
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Didn't give up

624
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
Authority parts

625
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,112
He published endless tirades and sent them out to anybody who would listen

626
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Please show tonight

627
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
In paper

628
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
Or pacification

629
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
And

630
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,496
The administration of the program or Shirley was working was desperate to make him go away he had basically just

631
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
Destroyed the program and so

632
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,616
In 1982 he and the BCI

633
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Finally come to an agreement

634
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
It was

635
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
AIA financial

636
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,576
Settlement that satisfied him what was the financial settlement

637
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
$160,000

638
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:31,072
You know we were a little program in the basement of the Ontario crippled Children's Center

639
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
We were

640
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
You know just the classroom

641
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Wow that

642
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,544
To a guy who wanted to save the world ends up

643
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Robbing a bunch of

644
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Disabled kids

645
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
I'm at Calabria crudely with us house

646
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Southfield

647
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
They're basically that's

648
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Then

649
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
Did the symbols ever go anywhere

650
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,952
Well there was a lot of excitement about it in the beginning

651
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,512
But it never spread very far it's used

652
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,632
Now it a few schools in Canada and Sweden a couple other places

653
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,472
But it never went very far because he was constantly

654
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,056
Taking it down at every turn

655
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,384
But here's what I find most surprised

656
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
When I when I talk to Shirley

657
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
She didn't have

658
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Any bitterness

659
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Not even in the worst mom

660
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
When we were having the final

661
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Legal

662
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
Action

663
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,328
Go through that in the morning and escalators are packing up their papers

664
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,680
Charles Place with Beach across the table and eats I surely will you help me

665
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
So should go to lunch with him

666
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,128
Sit with him and then he asked me if I would come to his hotel that night and put the ear drops in his ears

667
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,688
And I did that every night he would

668
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
Involved with the sink that's just the way it was

669
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,832
It wasn't just that she takes care of people for a living

670
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
She fell in

671
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Still feels

672
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
That Charles Bliss had created

673
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Something

674
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Really new in the world

675
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
She even told me that

676
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
When she uses Bliss symbols

677
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Actually thinks differently

678
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Yes

679
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Definitely

680
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
Stephen what what's different

681
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,080
Oh I just think so much more but what a word means

682
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
And it's it's it's like

683
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Poetry in its purest form

684
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,600
I can playing with stained glass down here in my

685
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,416
Retirement and you can you know you can just

686
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,488
Take the symbols and put them into one

687
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Composite

688
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
And

689
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
They say things that only I can say

690
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
It's beautiful

691
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Transmit

692
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,288
A meaning that is beyond any word

693
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
Thanks producer Tim Howard

Which I do not have to interact with another human being

707
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
Bliss

708
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976

716
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
Thanks in this message

717
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,960
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

718
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,080
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

719
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

720
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,088
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance

721
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,184
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

722
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,048
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

723
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:51,168
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

724
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
Or maybe the kid was a piano

725
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,080
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

726
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,688
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

727
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,992
We're interested in the

728
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Specific moments where

729
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,880
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

730
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,184
If you have a story

743
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,784
Forget About Dre now we're going to look for protection right here

744
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Physical

745
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Okay so

746
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
Soda story

747
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
The perfect person

748
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
It begins with a with a birthday

749
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
Is February 9th 1880

750
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
6 miles outside the

751
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Tiny Town of Jericho Vermont

752
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
And we're on a farm a family farm

753
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
Bentley

754
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,056
Family Farm And The scrawny 15 year old kid named Wilson

755
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
Get the microscope from his mother

756
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
So it's February and its Vermont and so naturally the first thing this kid does is he grabs a handful of

757
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
PicsArt

758
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Single

759
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Flake

760
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
And he puts it under the mic

761
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
And what he sees

762
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
This is is the most

763
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Beautiful thing he

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
He's ever seen

765
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Stereo land

766
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
And perfect

767
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
He calls them Master P

768
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
As 830

769
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
A great work

770
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
Safari cousin that

771
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,080
In his fifteen-year-old looking back he talked about that moment

772
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
And what he was thinking when he when he started for

773
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
Obviously

774
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
In a minute sir

775
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Maven II

776
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Master P

777
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Disappeared

778
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
Without leaving any evidence

779
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
The date that they ever

780
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
They just started

781
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:28,864
Ines he remembers that he he should have decided then and there that he's going to dedicate his whole life

782
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
Ted 2 documenting bees

783
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Master P

784
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Otherwise no one will ever

785
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Know that

786
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Even exist

787
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,824
He's going to spend his whole life documented snowflakes

788
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Yeah it's a good life Jen

789
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,968
And it pays well

790
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
It's just me with lazy and didn't want to do the farming chores

791
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:57,536
The beauty the beauty really good at digging potatoes but he just sort of was

792
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,608
So busy fussing around with his microscope that you know

793
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
I don't like this kid I don't like him

794
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
Depends your work ethic

795
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
That sucks so he takes his mic

796
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
Any moves it to this unheated Woodshed Baha'i

797
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
A man and he starts catching

798
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Snowfall

799
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
And what Wally schedule you can't even breathe

800
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
Because he was worried that his breath would melt

801
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
His specimen

802
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
Holding his breath in in drawing these you know this extremely complex Crystal that they can take

803
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
Thinking maybe it'll maybe an hour to drop it

804
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:40,032
But depending on the temperature of the humidity the size of the crystal he had most yet 5 minutes

805
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,408
If you look at the mall and and he's not

806
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Satisfied

807
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,736
He just felt like you wasn't doing it just

808
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
You know what he calls these

809
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Miracles of

810
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
So Bentley

811
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
Persuade this mother who persuades his father

812
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
YouTube I am a camera

813
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Where is a great white weight

814
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,768
1880 where in February 1880

815
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,816
We entered into the in the era of picture

816
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
Taking shots

817
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Just barely

818
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
And for farming families

819
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Just like a lot of money

820
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Birthday by for him

821
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,312
And he gets it any sort of Jerry Riggs it to the microscope

822
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
And at age 19

823
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Wilson Bentley

824
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
The first person ever in his

825
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
3

826
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
The photograph

827
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
A snowflake

828
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
Emily Cuvee

829
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
Snowflake celebration music here

830
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
From then on

831
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
Basically for the next

832
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
46 Winter's until he died

833
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,864
Every snowfall every blizzard

834
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
This a Bentley would stand in the doorway of his little Shack

835
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
Holding out a wooden tray

836
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
With

837
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
With thick mittens cuz you would wear these drumstick oven mitts

838
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,384
It took to make sure that his

839
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:53,760
None of his body heat would kind of leak out and then inadvertently melt any of the snow

840
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
Tweets artists and their

841
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,648
Give it a once-over with his eye if nothing was promising hehehe busy we had a

842
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,720
A turkey feather and he would sort of just wipe it clean with

843
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
What is turkey feather

844
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Until I did find something you like

845
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
And then and then he would

846
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
Tiny little wooden rod

847
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
And he would just

848
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Really delicately

849
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Tap the center of the Earth

850
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Crystal MN

851
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
Really really really gently lifted off

852
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
And then transfer it onto

853
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Country Glass

854
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Slide

855
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
So that you could put it under the

856
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Mexico end

857
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
He could photograph

858
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
Basically

859
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,600
Photographs of a5000 snow crystals

860
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
Just a farmer

861
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
Doing this kind of is a hobby

862
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
But he sold copies of these photos for $0.05 a pop to places like Harvard in the British museum in the u.s. weather

863
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Weather bureau

864
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,192
Research journals magazines like nature and National Geographic

865
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
I mean you've already seen the phone

866
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
It's like you've gotten them on a Christmas card they're on your

867
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
Like ugly Christmas

868
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
My sweater in your closet somewhere

869
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,199
Turn shirt with them on right now

870
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,343
They're everywhere they're beautiful symmetrical

871
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Really clean and complex

872
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,951
A lot of the greatest scientist who ever lived like

873
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,535
Descartes and Kepler and hook they all tried to

874
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
Sketch and draw

875
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,447
And capture the essence of snowflakes but none of them could do it as well as this one

876
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
Obsessive loaner from Jericho Vermont whose photos were perceived to become more faithful to Nature than then

877
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
Than anybody else's

878
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
That was until

879
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
This other guy

880
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
German guy

881
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,855
Q the other guy dramatic theme music

882
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,671
Yes yes

883
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:41,535
He was a German meteorologist named Gustav hellmann

884
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
Gustav Hellman

885
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
Not of the man

886
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Fame I don't believe

887
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,823
I hadn't even thought of that I could see a contemporary of

888
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
Yes and he's working on his own book about weather

889
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Until he hires a

890
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,503
Micro photographer

891
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
Who is another German guy named Richard neuhaus and Mike

892
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
Microscopic himself and you just take normal size

893
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,863
Put it on and they take a bunch of photos using basically similar

894
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
Technology

895
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Cameron

896
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Essentially

897
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
But would they find

898
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Is

899
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Totally different

900
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,615
Date did you not find it

901
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
The elegants metric

902
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,735
Ideal snow crystals that Bentley found

903
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,295
Did the crystal they found work

904
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
Laud

905
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,135
Lopsided

906
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Broken

907
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:46,559
In the Martian who would only ever seen like glossy fashion magazines

908
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,631
I just been given some like random family photo album

909
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
Oh wow this is

910
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
They're not so

911
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
Pretty ladies are kind of ugly

912
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Call

913
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
Did Germans day

914
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
They basically called him out. Bentley was a fraud

915
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,623
There was a particular way that Bentley prepared his photographs what you would do if you would use

916
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Pen knife

917
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,975
Scrape the negative around the snow crystal which is

918
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
What gave it.

919
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,559
Can I make black background because he thought it would

920
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
Can put it in me to soccer relief

921
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,423
The German guy said that's

922
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,007
It's it's misleading that it become mutilates the snowflakes

923
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
Wait so he's

924
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
Photographing these

925
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Snowflakes

926
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
And then

927
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,175
Significantly messing with the photograph

928
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Exactly right

929
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Exactly right

930
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,759
Here's a quote from the

931
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
Photographer who sad quotes

932
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,647
In many images Bentley did not limit himself to improving the outline

933
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
He let his nice

934
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
Play deep inside the heart of the crystal

935
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
Fully arbitrary figures

936
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Emerged

937
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,887
Well I don't know that doesn't seem so

938
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
Got no longer a candidate

939
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Well that's

940
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
That's the question to them so they basically log this in

941
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Just kind of going in there

942
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Journals

943
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Bentley basically launches a counter-attack and what she says is that

944
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:15,903
Doing that not correcting your photographs was anybody use this word like pervert

945
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
Why wouldn't you remove specks of dust or other imperfections what white photograph of a broken snowflake when you

946
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,143
You can photograph complete one so this is a quote from Bentley he said

947
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
A true scientist

948
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,727
Best wishes above all to have his photograph

949
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
As true to Nature as possible

950
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,103
Any free touching will help in this respect

951
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Then it is

952
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Bully Justice

953
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
So he thought his

954
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Retouch snowflakes

955
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
For truer than

956
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
The

957
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Normal ones

958
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Yeah yeah exactly

959
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Did the scientist supposed to

960
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Various

961
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Experience

962
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Who is

963
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
Seen every different variation on a snowflake

964
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
But Ken

965
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,399
Bring it all together in one drawing One Scotch One photograph

966
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
The true snowflake

967
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
So if I brought him

968
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
A slightly

969
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Gloppy

970
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Snowflake

971
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,127
Look this is what fell on my nose

972
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
This is a true snowflake

973
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Because it actually

974
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,503
We fell from the sky and it's you know it was a nun

975
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Enhance

976
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Yankee Woods

977
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,647
Say that you're an amateur like

978
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
Like this is this is not good work

979
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,351
You know this is an aberration this is an abnormality why would you choose to kind of highlight an abnormality as opposed to

980
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
What kind of disturbance

981
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
True ideal snowflake

982
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
It does that one exists

983
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,591
That's the key question for me like does the ideal snowflake exist in nature

984
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
You think there are such

985
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
I am scripture

986
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,503
Sadly beautiful I would like to think there are no I think it if my

987
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,135
Facts are right but the world snowflake expert is actually in in Pasadena Calif

988
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
All right

989
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
Check check check check check

990
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
Who can sunny Southern California

991
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
Yeah t-shirt I have sunscreen lathered and I'm going to talk to

992
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,031
World Authority on

993
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,359
Snow

994
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:17,247
How are you his name is Tenley bracket he's a professor of physics at Caltech

995
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,831
Wilson Bentley

996
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,927
Turn of a snowflake pictures under 10000 now

997
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
He actually

998
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Mix

999
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,935
Artificially okay wow so this is a giant tank this is a nitrogen

1000
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,239
Nevermind that

1001
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,823
And get to your question about the ideal snowflake

1002
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
A few things so number one

1003
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
Thereof

1004
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Bajillion different kind

1005
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,039
Dendritic Crystal Stellar dendrites needles and columns and Hollow columns and

1006
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
And the sectored plates

1007
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
There never was so every single moment as it falls to the Earth

1008
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,071
It's either growing or shrinking

1009
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,935
Get depending on the kind of trajectory through the different pockets of weather as it's moving down

1010
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
There is no real

1011
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
Platonic ideal form of a snow

1012
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Because it's

1013
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
So

1014
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Influx

1015
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
There's no such thing as a purple

1016
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Snowflake

1017
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
But

1018
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
That doesn't stop Kenly black from

1019
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
I'm looking

1020
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
You know I tried upping

1021
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,647
Taho in Japan Ramon Michigan carnivals all over the world

1022
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
Looking for Bentley perfect

1023
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Alaska

1024
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
And Alaska

1025
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
Just waiting for my favorite spot is Northern Ontario

1026
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
Boomtown called Cochran

1027
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
Population 5480

1028
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
So where do you go in Cochran Georgia

1029
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
Just anywhere they're just falling all over the place mostly it's the it's the parking lot of my month my hotel

1030
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
Because there's a lot of waiting

1031
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,175
You're only really snow as well that once a week

1032
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,015
Even though things have to be Goldilocks perfect too high

1033
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,671
Then they evaporate a little on the way down there look for a pretty or if the clouds are too light or too heavy

1034
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,023
And a lot of times the temperature is wrong if you want those Christmas

1035
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
Hard supermodel snowflakes

1036
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
You need to have exactly - 15 that's

1037
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
5 degrees Fahrenheit

1038
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Not so much wind

1039
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
So that they'll put her down slowly and have more time to grow but every once in a while I mean when are the conditions are right

1040
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,711
You go outside in a hopeful anticipating

1041
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
I got crap

1042
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
11 garbage out here

1043
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,135
So you back go back inside and read some more email and you come back a half an hour later

1044
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Nope still lousy

1045
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
Can you half hour later note

1046
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,047
Still allows it and you know you do this for hours and then all of a sudden they'll get

1047
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Really good

1048
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
The letter that I just out there

1049
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Frantically

1050
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
Trying to collect as many as I can

1051
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
What what a thinks I like to think about

1052
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
This is it here I am

1053
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,615
With my little piece of cardboard in a middle of a

1054
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Continent

1055
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
It's snowing

1056
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,527
I am catching some incredibly small number

1057
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,575
Of these things for a brief.

1058
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,463
And getting some really cool pictures and so you kind of wonder what that what else is out there you want you missing

1059
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,095
I mean imagine just all the beautiful little works of art that are there just falling down

1060
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,167
Totally unnoticed and then they just disappear

1061
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,775
I mean stuff that is far prettier than any of the pictures I have cuz they're out there

1062
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
You know they're out there statistically

1063
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,151
They're out there and so you know there's such an awful lot of

1064
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:31,039
Really gorgeous thing that you just starve like you say they're just totally ephemeral and you'll never see them

1065
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
And they're falling constantly

1066
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,975
You sort of want to just stop the world and go look at them

1067
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:58,175
Thanks a lot of Nasser and toucan

Hot pastrami at Katz's Deli in the Lower East Side of New York City

1078
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,023
We're 5 hours away from New York and don't get there very often

1079
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:50,143
So I spent a lot of time in between visits thinking about that first taste

1080
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,679
Pastrami

1081
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:58,335
Call for me that's Bliss I get to think about some kind of almost unattainable perfection

1082
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
It is attainable I just show up and there it is

1083
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
