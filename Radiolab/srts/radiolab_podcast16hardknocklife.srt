Small app

Animal which begins

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Appropriately

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
Pretty very small

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Noise

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,368
Yes I was saving in days

Nostalgia producer

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
So you mention that that

30
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Grandpa's

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
A land looks like he might die soon

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
I just want to know why that's funny but sit and stand

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
It would be out of respect

34
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
Would be very quiet

35
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,368
Creeping around the house

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
And when everyone was really quiet

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,792
They tear these faint drumming noise coming from the from the Timbers of the hives

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,960
I can try and do an impression of the noise I hear you very well

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
You get that

40
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Yeah

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Yeah so

42
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
506 identical beat

43
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,784
End and Legend has it book

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Was the Medieval drumming his fingers and patiently waiting for the soul to depart the butt

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
47

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
But

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,584
Wenzhou actually it's the mating call of a tiny little beetle

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
The death-watch beetle

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Before it gets its name

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
So they became a kind of a fan of these

51
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah it's a widespread species and he's got a house that's

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
It is

53
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Pretty decrepit is

54
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Slightly falling down the roof leak

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
Whatever but is it hiring to a whole host of

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
These little people

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
And in the quiet he can hear the

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
So a while ago he found himself wondering what's this noise really loud

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,704
At which you might not think would be a great mystery

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
But what he discovered is It's All About Love

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Or at least

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Sex

63
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
So today

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
A story that reminds us so difficult

65
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Lonely

66
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
How hard

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
The Mating Game can be

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
Perfect Valentine's Day

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
At the beginning of the life cycle

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Yeah so so the female betta lays an egg

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
At peace of death

72
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Basic he would watch the

73
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
And the moms we just

74
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
Drop their babies randomly

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Here

76
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
There

77
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
Usually into a hole in log

78
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
Going to a would be a little tiny boy

79
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Grub

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
So you might have to pitch black

81
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Do you have any time on its own

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
I need stop chewing

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
I choose away at the woods

84
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Very very slightly

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
And eventually

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,336
10 or 15 years later years it going to shoot for 10 to 15 years

87
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Yeah it for a decade or more

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,016
Whole thing and eventually it reaches the Magnificent size of about a quarter of an inch

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
Which point is

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Heights at turns into a little little chrysalis

91
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
And a few months later

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Seattle beetle

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Tattoo sizes

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
Until finally it crawls out of the log and onto the

95
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
Is that the first time they see light

96
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Yeah yeah

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
That would be it

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
3070 the adults that you have a really

99
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
See

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,367
I'm possibly the most boring looking insects

101
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Bullet shape

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Still Brian

103
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
They really easily mistaken for mice

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Things actually end

105
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
The beato Lenny has really one job and that's tonight

106
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Shop the male betta

107
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Has to find himself a female

108
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
Who is aeschylus work for one thing as an adult

109
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
He doesn't

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Econ Fades series

111
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,663
Going to starve to death in a couple of weeks so side on top of that he's nearly blind

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
Yeah that's where this strange

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Drumming noise

114
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Comes in

115
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,367
That's bad why finding each other in the end in the usually roll the dock

116
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Places where they live

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
That's your way of saying

118
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Hello

119
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,815
Hello yeah and they make it by drumming the head

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,911
The male betta Lee kind of braces himself and then he wipes his head 5c

121
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
6 *

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Oh you start rubbing your head you mean banging your head

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,615
Yeah it's like headbutts the timber he's sitting on but he's kind of full head if you like

124
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
So that's what makes the drumming noise

125
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
Buccaneers head against the wood

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
So

127
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
He comes out of his

128
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Just one day

129
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Disease little drumming

130
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Noise

131
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Now if a human happens

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
To hear him

133
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
People these days they tend to spray that

134
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Houses with inside

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
I didn't like the end of The Beatles

136
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
But

137
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Lettuce you

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Assume that he doesn't okay

139
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
He just keeps wandering by banging his head

140
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Any poses for sex

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
I'm listening to see if anyone reply

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Reply you want the zone

143
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Unfortunately

144
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
According to David

145
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
Deathwatch beetles quite rare these days

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
Except there is a distinct chance will never find a female

147
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
This just gets more and more depressing

148
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,687
Can you tell the same story from the from the female's perspective

149
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
She just sort of his

150
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Is she just

151
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Waits in silence

152
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
For three weeks and if no one comes she just

153
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
She just purchased

154
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,255
She doesn't she wanted to ride a little bit I spies in the in the hope that she might

155
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
I might help it that's what that's

156
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
That is all she does

157
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Tedious life I'm afraid

158
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
But let's imagine

159
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Begin for the sake of argument

160
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
That's after the 15 years of chewing and no fumigation

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
At all

162
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Really

163
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
He gets a reply

164
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Big fine teacher

165
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
She makes the noise immediately after

166
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Is she hears the cry but of a male

167
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
And he get Ben gets very excited

168
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,583
Could you buy if you're wondering about Chinese headed for today's

169
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
And this'll do you at get scared

170
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,007
He stops running around banging his head over and over again

171
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
This is his moment and eventually

172
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
Eat more often than not he would eventually

173
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Find a female in jail

174
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Belial will immediately jumped on top of Eden

175
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,255
Continues to draw me his head but this time he's not head-butting the timber he's he's walking her

176
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,607
Which Wich Dominique that works for a

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
The female that's what's Pizza

178
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,239
Because they very short-sighted they will often jump on the runway rang

179
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
And and that's that's not so good

180
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,199
Because the females can actually control the cat he called. Tonight so he has to persuade her

181
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,807
Tequila price

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,159
Well so you usually she she carries on replying

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,023
Finding hair in the back of the head and she's she's

184
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
That's usually a good sign that you if she carries on buying a head on the on the 10 but that means she's probably going to make it in the end

185
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Within the next minute or two

186
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
Birthday says when he has watched this happen

187
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
He's noticed that caught up in the females wouldn't matter what even though you know that maybe been sitting there for days waiting room

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
Finally doesn't he finally gets

189
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
They're not interested

190
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
To me this is a very

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
Discerning lady that she

192
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
Chooses death over and ugly

193
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Make well I guess she's not

194
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
She's hoping that she'll get a Best invite another fish in the sea another fish in the sea

195
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,103
But I told what's the difference why are some male successful in Sumner

196
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711
I need quickly became clear that the heavier the man the more likely he wants

197
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
2 BC

198
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Successful

199
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
There's some explanation

200
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Hawaii

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
They produced

202
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Staggering amounts

203
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
What do you mean by stagger

204
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
The average was 13% of his body wash

205
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
13 /

206
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,983
What he wants us like what would that be like at 3 or 4 gallons

207
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Pho

208
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
Think about that from girl just best not to think about that too much pretty disturbing

209
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
So the Deep tragedy

210
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
Would be to be a member of this species and to be born

211
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Scrawny

212
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,927
Scrawny how big are you

213
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,791
Really skinny should I be in trouble anyway

214
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
What do I really want you tonight what

215
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Where the females actually

216
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Just weighing in the mail

217
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,775
I also was it something that was car lights with being a Big Mac

218
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Maybe they were

219
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Strong girl made a lot of noise

220
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
The ugliest way to try and

221
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Fine.

222
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Restaurant officially changed

223
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
The weight of the male

224
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
To make tiny fat suits

225
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,135
For the exactly yeah I'm not quite but

226
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
I wish this work for people that would be hilarious but it

227
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
We have the stuff called Blu Tack in the in the UK do you have Bluetooth

228
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
Sticky tack I guess he used to stick posters on the wall

229
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,311
So Dave went to the store bought some of the stuff and then just beat it up into little bits and

230
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Stuck them on the back of

231
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
F mail

232
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
To make them a little bit heavier

233
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
And for the skinny males it would

234
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Apsley tree tinsel

235
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,903
I do feel slightly main but they spoil females obviously we're getting a bit Short Change

236
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
But

237
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
Hopefully they managed to produce some eggs anyway they find these beetles the males and the females surprising

238
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Pycharm

239
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
And after all he doesn't live with

240
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
A lot of

241
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Play stealing my hypothesis

242
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Chewing away at the beams

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
I I've been

244
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
I told you a part of me knows that if I didn't spray them

245
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Some insecticide been eventually

246
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
The three.

247
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
It's going to take decades

248
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Wind Point Lighthouse

249
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
Safe for the moment I bet they've been spayed and

250
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Antique white light listening to them

251
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
Tuckaway in the springtime

252
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
So you're sitting in bed at dawn or dusk

253
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Can you hear the

254
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Quiet banging and you think

255
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Yeah

256
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,263
Yeah it's it's it's funny as me the people full this was a Sinister noise and actually it

257
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
It's All About Love

258
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,815

Saddest months

264
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Thinking about this drug I found it it made

265
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
Give me think that dating a New York was pretty easy

266
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,719
But for people who are feel if you're feeling said we want to end that problem right away in the next

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,559
Every single person I know

292
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
So I got to be strangers as I was talking to

Ansel Adams

299
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
It seems so unfair

300
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
So we could be those people who's the we

301
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855

Is no joke who is Hamilton

306
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
I meant they go to guitar

307
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
Ambedkar who was in a movie called pitch perfect when he played a rap

308
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
Oh yeah by Wiz all guys

309
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,967
In an Elizabethan Beetle situation is Shakespearean deathwatch

310
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,063
That's right well the lady by Speedway by mail toll is going to be a woman

311
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
What time is going to be the man

312
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
So here

313
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Is the male beetle

314
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
Being the beetle that he

315
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Poops he can be

316
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935

317
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
I and I am him the most masculine be so by the name of slim the evolution may be small so I can slip through the cracks up

318
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
I'll be the first one to jump on a lady Beetle back but it's hard out here and I'm not playing

319
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
They think that they don't understand

320
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
Slimmer so I'm a winner I finally see the sun people shorty and I know that you the one so I'm like Beetle baby doll

Yeah I guarantee I'm your chosen but can you remind me which end goes in

324
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Is it hard

325
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
Yeah but I doubt therefore a beetle but for the female play by Lin Miranda I mean she's going to have her own agenda

326
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Needs to find a guy in half

327
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
She hopes it will be the best guy but I don't know

328
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
Could This Be Love

329
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
My mama told me to never said I was good as I was to

330
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639

331
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039

Somebody's knocking

333
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Power of the female

334
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239

00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
