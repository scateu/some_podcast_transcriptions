Hi

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
Emily Webster's the last

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
I take three years

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
I've been

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Tomorrow

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
A lot of reporting about

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
How humans

33
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Make more of themselves

34
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
Spritelike science stories ethical stories

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
End

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
We came up with this idea that beat

37
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,984
Play me reporting only on reproduction for the next 10 years of Radiolab that what if we just put them all together in a series

38
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
And so

39
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
We're about to do that for the next month we're going to do the series

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
And the name of the series is

41
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Gonads

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
I know you're thinking why I would ask you a question you can say now what do you think about the work going

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,584
Donuts

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
It's almost like that word moist

45
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Like a little

46
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
Yes that word does have certain connotations what do you think of

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,712
It's a slang term for balls Falls festival

48
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Dumawall

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,720
You just think like sweaty balls in mail jokes like kick you in the nap great

50
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
Would you think it has anything to do with ladies

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
No no

52
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
No no no

53
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
Did you know that ladies actually have gonads also

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
The gonads are both testes and ovaries

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
It is actually for men and women

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,272
Really I did not know that did not know that

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
90% of the people I talk to

58
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Didn't know that

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
They didn't know it both have gonads

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
Culture they stolen the word

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
And I think it's time we reclaim this word like

62
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
As a citizen

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
As a human

64
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
As a lady

65
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
As a science lover

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
I'm taking the word back

67
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
Go home

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Okay so this is episode 1

69
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
And this whole series like

70
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
Kind of came into being

71
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
With a single phrase

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
All right the duck is in the house

73
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
From this guy

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Can you

75
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Stay for me your name and

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
How you identify your

77
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
Good luck. I I am an ovarian biologist

78
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,719
So I have a research laboratory at Yale University School of Medicine

79
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
So

80
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Taipei

81
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,351
He is the one who said they going to Hazard a magical Oregon

82
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
They are

83
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
So aktay is Turkish

84
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,015
You know I was a curious kid he grew up in Istanbul I was a tricky as a child

85
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
And I and I was 10 years old I would dinner

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Do you know looking to University

87
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Sky Zone

88
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
And trying to understand.

89
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,327
Make make sense out of this whole thing

90
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,191
What was it about the

91
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
The sky that attracted you was the concept of infinity

92
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
You know

93
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
We're just

94
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
Living a mundane life on this

95
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
Planet without thinking of

96
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Anything but

97
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
Routine that concerns but at the same time

98
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
America

99
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
This vast

100
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Space around us and most of you have no clue

101
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
We live

102
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Oblivious to that fact

103
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
And I would lose

104
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Sleepover that when I was

105
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Really

106
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Fast forward activate goes to medical school in Turkey he becomes a doctor specifically an OBGYN

107
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Silver a lot of babies

108
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Probably 20000 or so

109
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:12,991
That's like birthing a small town after having read 20000 delivery I said

110
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Yeah perhaps

111
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Stop

112
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
This is not my calling to be a little bit more

113
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
More towards the beginning of the process

114
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
You know when you are an obstetrician you're dealing with the finished product right

115
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,911
Why is think that's a crazy statement because most people think babies are the very beginning of the process

116
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm not sure what gets more beginning then like a small baby

117
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Hypnotic

118
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
A lady that feels like the starting line started something

119
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Scents that

120
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Most of the decisions most of something had already been decided by the time the baby gets out and that hole for

121
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Processes

122
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Fascinating

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
To drag him into the studio to talk about

124
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Magical gonads basically just figure out why are they met

125
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
I'm interested how you settled on that word

126
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Yeah what did I say

127
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Did I think Madrigal

128
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
For many reasons one is

129
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
Their original aliens told me

130
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
What he learned when he started studying this stuff

131
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
We set the origin of the gonad like it's

132
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Creation

133
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Restorative the beginning

134
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
Because it starts with this whole Saga that is so involved and so extreme

135
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
Did the baby itself does kind of feel like an afterthought

136
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,375
He calls it the Great Migration The Great Migration

137
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,959
Oxy got me into the story and so answer calling a bunch of people about it

138
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
In my lab we have a slogan that says gonads or go home

139
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
We have T-shirts

140
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
You don't you do ever t-shirt

141
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:49,503
That is Blanche Capel professor in cell biology at Duke University Medical Center

142
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
She eventually

143
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Studies

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
All the parts of the story we're about to tell you

145
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Okay so

146
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
Place this story in time that begins at about

147
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Oh

148
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
Two or three weeks in humans I bet that's a day 24 just to be safe which basically means a sperm fertilized in

149
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
An egg

150
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
23 days ago could be petri dish

151
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
It could be sax

152
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Who knows

153
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
But inside this woman's uterus

154
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
His little organism that has been growing for 24 days

155
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
What does embryo look like

156
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
If I comrade-in-arms Pat Walters who's the editor of the series

157
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
I don't know how to describe this

158
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,415
Very well to you I could send you a picture because it kind of look like a tadpole

159
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Exactly that's not

160
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,047
So wrong looks like a tadpole ever look at very early embryos like curled up

161
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
There's a tail there's like the the

162
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
Sort of ball of the embryo that's like

163
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Forming

164
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
The developing body and then it has this like sweep

165
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Of a tail that's coming off

166
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,223
If you zoom into the tail you'll see a little region it's called the Allen towis

167
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Call the Allentown

168
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Which is the trash bag of the Umbria

169
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,903
Before the embryo has an X

170
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Excretory system

171
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
It dumps

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Things that it doesn't want in the Allen Towing

173
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,423
Urine flows in and out there

174
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
So have a terrible place

175
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,895
It's like a foreign Planet this isn't actually part of the embryo itself now it's sort of in the hinterland

176
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,015
Valentine was I always imagined was is

177
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Is

178
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
Where Harrison Ford was camped out in Blade Runner 2049 which is like that fast

179
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Dust desert super orange dust yeah there's like

180
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
Storms in end like winds blowing over the desert

181
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
And it's here

182
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Where you find some cells

183
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,711
These very specialized cells germ cells a germ cell primordial

184
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
These are the sounds that are going to go on that Great Migration

185
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
And put the magic

186
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
In the gonads

187
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
They are very interesting cell type there

188
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
They're set aside

189
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,095
Very early in embryogenesis and how many are there like

190
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
It's not that I think you're

191
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
Something like 40 week that's it

192
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Yes

193
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
40 biblical number and the irony here is is

194
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,151
Besells sort of like huddled at the edges of this Wasteland

195
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Might actually be the most important cells in the body

196
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
Because after the embryo grows

197
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
After the baby gets born

198
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
After that baby goes through puberty

199
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,559
And one day maybe decides to have a kid these cells are present at the very beginning

200
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Vcel

201
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Iron charge

202
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,543
I'm making a next generation of you that's the meaning of life right that's the origin of life these cells

203
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Everything else

204
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Are we think it's brain heart Etc but

205
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
I think everything else

206
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Is there

207
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
The supports

208
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
The survival of the germs

209
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,391
They're the stem-cell of the species rights or stem cell means

210
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
A cell that can create other cells

211
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
An originator cell we have stem cells for long stem cells farts stem cells for neurons these cells are the only

212
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,191
Cells that can make on their own all the other kind of cells that they can make a whole person

213
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
So it's a

214
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
They have a remarkable underlying

215
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Pluripotency

216
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Do you think they know that well that's

217
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
I mean that those are very difficult questions answered

218
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
No I think germ cells know they're really special cells

219
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
But I don't think they know what they're going to become

220
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,951
We can ask question if they're so special why do they start out in the trash

221
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Yeah that seems like a bad place

222
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
You would think

223
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,143
Very curious at The Germ cells arise near that position and it's unclear why or

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,983
You hide your most precious object in the trash

225
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
Dumb as I got like the best Mission Impossible

226
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,503
Like murder on the Orient Express. Maybe that's the plan I don't know

227
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
In all seriousness

228
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
For some reason scientist

229
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
Don't know exactly why it seems like evolution is decided to

230
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
Giuseppe's sells a side at the beginning of development

231
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Which means I have to make a journey

232
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,375
Back to the middle of the embryo where their Destinies will be revealed

233
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
And if they make it there we make it there

234
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
If they don't

235
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
We don't

236
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,895
Okay okay so so they hang around to Dusty Wasteland

237
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
For a few days old against the elements

238
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Imagine if I was in that situation I would just like to be wondering how I this was my lot in life to some sort of cause

239
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Cosmic joke

240
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
Since I have a sense I may be important but I'm just here

241
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
Don't know why is a wasteland

242
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
Don't they hang out like that for a couple of days

243
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
And then

244
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,175
Place a call

245
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
The hear call

246
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
Baby smell call procedure there's a signal there called into action and so-so starting my grade

247
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
They literally move wow what a wait so

248
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
How does a cell March they actually extend Philip odia which are Little Love cell like feet

249
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
Is it like it pops out to feet and then it goes walking self send out extensions

250
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,335
And that extension has a little adhesion molecule on it like a little sticky

251
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Spot

252
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,687
So when it puts his foot out it can pull the rest of the cell up to it

253
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
So

254
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
They take a hike pike pike

255
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Bike

256
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
And The Germ cells seem to be

257
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,231
Holding hands like a long string of paper dolls

258
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
And they touch each other

259
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Though they are

260
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,679
The whole crowd is like going together and after a bit of a hike they get

261
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
To the wall of the embryo just like I don't know if pulsating mass and somehow

262
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
This is a very blurry. I have to say they push their way through the wall

263
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
And on the other side

264
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
It's just chaos there

265
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
It's like a foreign planets

266
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
Because what's happening is I need this the embryo is just like dividing dividing dividing dividing dividing it.

267
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,191
The whole embryo is developing very fast at this stage

268
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Trying to start forming Parts like once before

269
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,407
Oregon's wants to form a nervous system in all kinds of signals flying around to tell the got the form and to tell the liver.

270
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
For blood cells are popping up

271
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
You know all these signals are flashing all around

272
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
And yet The Germ cells their job is to block it all out

273
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,767
They migrated right down the middle of the embryo

274
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
At the midline

275
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
Almost like where you could think like a spine would be

276
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
Through a forest of sickle

277
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Going around in the embryo

278
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
And the signals are from farting

279
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
Trying to tempt them like hey

280
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
B letter sound

281
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Believer South Combee liver B liver

282
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Sometimes you sounds like

283
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
I want to be a liver

284
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Am I a liver

285
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
No wait something tells me I should keep marching

286
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,327
It seems scary doesn't it yeah they go through a battle

287
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Hey do you know if they ever lose one along the way like the chain is going and they're trying to like don't differentiate don't differentiate

288
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
Just like the fourth one from the end ever going to become a stomach and then like oh crap

289
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Probably

290
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
It happens

291
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
But they try to stay focused

292
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Together and they try to resist

293
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
All of those signals that

294
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Could divert them from their destiny

295
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
They want to say uncommitted

296
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
These might be the last

297
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Shells

298
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
In the developing mammalian embryo

299
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
To give up

300
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Their world of possibilities

301
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
This is David page

302
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
He is the director of the Whitehead Institute biologist

303
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
Did a mighty if you see what I'm saying so

304
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Basically when I want an egg

305
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Is fertilized by a sperm

306
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
To go back to the

307
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
That beginning

308
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
The resulting cell called a zygote

309
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
The fertilized egg

310
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
Has the possibility has the

311
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
Pencil to become every type of cell in the body

312
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
And as

313
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
One cell becomes two and two become 4 and so on and so on

314
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
Eventually some cells

315
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,383
Give up that broad range of possibilities and become committed to narrower

316
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Occupations and specializations

317
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Are we have at least

318
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,343
200 or 300 specialized cell types that make up our body all the other cells

319
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
Make the transition from possibility to reality

320
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,279
And those migrating primordial germ cells are the last cells

321
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
To give up a wide range of possibility

322
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
How I like them for their like

323
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
Pugnaciousness

324
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Yes

325
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Okay we're getting back to the band of 40 we're back in the thick of things they're marching through the middle of the embryo

326
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,783
Rio being like pelted internet fighting off all these other signals

327
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
And they do this for one day

328
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
1 days

329
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
3 days

330
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
4

331
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
I imagine they get tired as they go

332
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
6

333
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
The signal that they're following is getting strong

334
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Longer

335
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
And then pretty soon

336
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Over the Horizon

337
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
I'm kind of either side of the

338
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
They start to see

339
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
These mountains

340
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Urogenital Ridge is going to

341
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
Emerge as sort of a mountain off the

342
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Back wall of the body cavity

343
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
They're still marching down this path are following the Cigna

344
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Now the mountains are getting closer and closer

345
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
And then it's some point the path in front of them

346
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
It goes left and it goes to the right

347
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
And half the cells will go to the left and half the cells will go to the right regardless of what direction they go in they end up at

348
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
The base of a mountain

349
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,535
In the mountain is a mass of

350
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
Dense mass of cells

351
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
And they come right up

352
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
To the edge

353
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Of the mountain wall

354
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
And they're able to just like

355
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:56,127
Push those sell the side and like squeeze into the entire

356
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Carrier of the mountain

357
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Which is an entirely new space

358
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
So

359
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
The Germ cells enter

360
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Enter the gungeon at

361
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
Oh this is the gonna yeah this is the place that will either be

362
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
An ovary or testis

363
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
In which

364
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Has it been figured out which it is

365
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
At this point it could go either way

366
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
I think about this place

367
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
As a cathedral

368
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
And the cathedral

369
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Struction

370
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
And as they walk in there they probably know immediately that this is the place that's been calling that because that's

371
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
Signal that they've been following everywhere

372
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,167
Maybe when I get to the gonad the whole cell is surrounded by the signal

373
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
And that tells the cell to stop

374
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
But this is just a guess what do you think it's like

375
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
For that for the germ cells like sure they've been going on this walk

376
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
And then they get to a place that says

377
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
Stay here so I wonder what the stay here like

378
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
Kind of feels like I think it feels like home

379
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
You're Marching for almost two solid weeks

380
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
We finally arrived

381
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
They recognized

382
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
This is where they belong

383
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
Everyone I talked to said probably still at this point

384
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
They don't even know what lies ahead for

385
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,455
Or even why they're there but why not

386
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
David page again

387
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
I would suggest that the primordial germ cells

388
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
They have been instruct

389
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Did

390
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
To migrate to the genital Ridge

391
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
But they don't know why

392
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
And they don't know what they're going to do

393
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
When they get there

394
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
They have not a clue

395
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
But the clue

396
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Is coming

397
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352

Okay to pick up on the action

430
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,232
The tribe of 40 they find themselves in his Cathedral like space

431
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,096
Technical name the medicine effort gonadal region

432
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
There in this beautiful space

433
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,800
But what happens is immediately when they enter they are surrounded by

434
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,408
Somatic cells

435
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,480
I imagine these cells as like friendly Monk

436
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Gliding around in red robes

437
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
Their job is to just protect you and make sure that

438
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
Nothing bad happens to you

439
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Tell these are the cells have been calling them

440
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
I don't know

441
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
That's kind of a hard question to answer because the general Ridge Head

442
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,728
Started forming when the germ cells began their migration so don't really know is like

443
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
What was sending the signal

444
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
But

445
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
After a few days some people say a few weeks

446
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,248
The somatic cells that are gathered around the

447
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
They reveal the destiny

448
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,904
They tell them either one of two things

449
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
You will become a sperm

450
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,840
Or

451
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
You will become

452
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Anime

453
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
What exactly this box I was doing though

454
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean

455
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Make some changes lately

456
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,344
Bumping them in some special way or releasing protein

457
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Well there are molecular

458
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,768
Signaling Cascades that are controlling the male or female fate of some of the germ cells

459
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
And what makes them go one way or the other

460
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,752
That is super complicated and we're going to get into it later in the series so for now I'll just say and mammals

461
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Sex is genetically controlled

462
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Bye

463
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,688
Whether or not you have two X chromosomes or an X and A Y chromosome

464
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:56,320
So she's basically like your fourth grade biology as if the cells in the cathedral have a y chromosome

465
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,672
Though though say sperm and if the cells and Cathedral have an XX

466
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
Chromosome Dulce

467
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
Acted so busy just fate and luck

468
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Which way they go

469
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Yes

470
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
But here's the cool part

471
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
If the monks tell the trim styles are there going to be

472
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,752
Sperm they basically divide a little bit and then the monks

473
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
Take the germ cells and they put them to

474
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Sleep disorders

475
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,712
I don't know he's like catacombs until

476
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Afterbirth in puberty

477
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
But

478
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
If the germ cells get told that there going to be a eggs

479
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
Something different happens inside of them and they just

480
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Go

481
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
State divided they divide quite a lot

482
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
Rapidly for a while and suddenly the band of 40 becomes

483
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
Thousand in 2010

484
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,368
Amongst men take each of these new eggs and embed them in the wall of the cathedral

485
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,720
/ / / /

486
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Boom

487
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
They literally shove the eggs into the wall of the House of gonna

488
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Yes

489
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,192
And this goes on for months as a matter of fact

490
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
The numbers

491
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Probably reach around 6 to 10 million

492
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,104
During the 5th month of pregnancy about 20 weeks

493
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Soca station

494
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,016
That embryonic ovaries going to have all the eggs they will ever have when it's only 5 months along

495
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
With this is all still in uterus this is all I can uterus happen

496
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
It has 10 million eggs and it is still itself months away from being born

497
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Yes

498
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512
Theoretically at that point

499
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
That is 500 times more

500
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,960
Babies been acting a ever delivered in his career in this one developing embryo

501
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Just occurred to me

502
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,432
If you go all the way back to the beginning of the story you told a 24 whatever

503
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Everett was

504
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
You got this little

505
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,528
Organism forming Pi the mother doesn't even know it

506
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
There yet

507
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Already

508
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
There are the cells

509
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
The in existence that will be

510
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,096
Of the kid she doesn't even know she has yet

511
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
So her grandkids

512
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,776
Are in there already is that right so when your pregnant with a person you carry inside of you

513
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Cells

514
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
That will make the next OU right it is Grandpa. It's like your grandkids are already inside of you inside of

515
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Your unborn child

516
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Child yes

517
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
That's been

518
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Yes

519
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Do you think the great grandkids are in there too

520
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
Will it stick all that that's what she means by stem cell of the species

521
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Because

522
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,120
It's the same material that makes vayven

523
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,680
They not only make the body they make more eggs

524
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
It's burnt they make the next generation of egg

525
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Sperm

526
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
So they're still there

527
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
So they're both making

528
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,664
A generation but then making the ability for that generation to make another generation

529
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Oh my God this is like

530
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
So it is look like you're mad at its mirrors

531
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
You're not only cradling like

532
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Your child your

533
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
Cradling like infinite future

534
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Homosapien

535
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Wow

536
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
At the infinity

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
It's crazy that all that is there and you're not even a thing

538
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Did the first thought

539
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Thought

540
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,960
The first thing that this organism has been programmed to do is not

541
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
Hey make a make a person make a brain

542
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Make a life

543
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
No it's make more

544
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
It's pretty gnarly

545
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,688
You know many many people believe that we exist just as a

546
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,040
Harborfreight germ cells until we can make new people like we're just their host

547
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,184
In some sense that's absolutely true I mean or as as was said a long time ago

548
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
A chicken

549
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
Is an egg's way of making another egg

550
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
I've never heard that before

551
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
At 2 I was in Michigan a couple of weeks in months ago

552
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
It does in Michigan and

553
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
I was

554
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Kayaking

555
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
On this river that has super Sandy Bottom that's a

556
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,832
Pretty shallow, looks like 3 or 4 ft deep

557
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,416
And the cool thing was that it was Sam and responding

558
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Huge

559
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Finish they were like

560
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
324 ft

561
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:26,400
They were so stick around and and there were so many of them that they would like Russell my kayak

562
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
And I see something

563
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
Carnival is one part of the river like buy it

564
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
Self

565
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
And I look and it's

566
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,408
Fish it's a salmon that's lying on the bottom of the

567
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
River

568
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,296
I see like through the Ripley Water I'm some like pink

569
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,648
Turn the car around to go like look at it when I realize is the

570
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
The pink is not like flash

571
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
The pink is like

572
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Hacked eggs

573
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
The body was sliced open so you could see into the hollow

574
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,680
An in Halo We're just like

575
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,288

576
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,336

And to think that parts of our body male and female by the way because the the testes do this just

580
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Little later

581
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
In life

582
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,208
Different parts of our body are like that fish

583
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Felt like just

584
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,072
Pulling back the curtain and

585
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912

Before I go later in the series we're going to dig into sex ed and one of the things that comes up in

590
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
Every conversation you have about sex ed is a book that somebody read to learn about the birds and the bees

591
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,824
It might have been given to them or they found it like in their library book sale

592
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,224
So we want to try and create an online sex as library with as many

Any of these books if we can find for all ages to go to radiolab.org sex ed

595
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
