1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
All right

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Hello

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey how you doing

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
I'm doing

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
You just say who you are real quick before we start

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,696
Pat Walters I'm a senior editor here excellent

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,280
Where do we start made you want tell me how you got into all this

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,656
Yeah okay so it's this series in this all started for me or I got

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Thinking about the

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
The thing we're about to talk about a lot

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,776
Because of

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
This

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,432
This moment several months ago where I should have got caught between to my closest

17
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
Friends I got

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Caught

19
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,040
I get caught

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,672
All the time it's really like a political is really hard

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Number one

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Is it

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Guy

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
I call him a bit of a contrarian politically

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
And we ended up getting a few arguments by this guy named Jordan Peterson

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
Precisely the sort of danger that people who are really looking

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Who

28
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,128
You probably know he's just come with figures I figure Canadian psychologist to is gotten

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
Set a lot of things that are very controversial about

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,320
Gender and race

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Like he thinks White Privilege is a myth and I said we should somehow enforced monogamy he certainly commands

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Movement is Big with dudes he's really big with white dude

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Yeah and

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
Best friend of mine is white dude

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,752
And so we were arguing about them things Jordan Peterson had said that my friend has liked

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
And it one point he was

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,384
He said to me he would have called me out he was like you've never even listened to the guy talk

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Thank you you were having all the arguments about as ideas

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
And that you've never even listened to

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Tulsa okay

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
FairPoint

42
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
I tried to tell her listen to him

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
And then

44
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
Enter friend number 2

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,328
We're hanging out couple days later and I told her I'm having a fight with friend number one

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Again

47
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,168
He wants me to listen to this guy Jordan Peterson I told him I do it

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Just to be fair

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
And she

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
I

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
I got this look on her face

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
And was like

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
Why would you

54
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
And like why would you do that

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
And then she said this thing to me that

56
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
I that really

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Stuck with me afterwards

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
And she said

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
His ideas are Dane

60
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
And remember thinking like

61
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
What makes an idea dangerous

62
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Even stepping down politic in my scientific thinking about the law all these Realms of ID

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Yes what makes one so

64
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Dangerous

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
Or threatening or risky that

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
We shouldn't even talk about

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
And so I

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
I decided to have a staff meeting

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
With off the radio my people

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
And ask everyone to bring their most dangerous

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Idea

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
This is a diagram

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,048
People brought all kinds of weird stuff that I have a amaryllis and fight them eating their worth

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Yeah it's a little tight

75
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Maybe there's

76
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
One species that we should just like agree we're going to let go

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
We only have a limited amount of time energy and money

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Stop worrying about the elephant let them all die

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
In February to just focus on that.

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Recycling is pointless

81
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
Probably just true

82
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Someone brought a lake

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,160
The idea that boys are better at math than girls right

84
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
A female staff member brought that one in cuz she heard it from her daughter's math teacher kratoville think that still

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
Breast cancer screening is pointless

86
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:54,240
There was something about a law in Nebraska that allows you to drop off a baby that you didn't want

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
God is dead assisted suicide psychiatric euthanasia

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,736
Britain arguing that I like mass incarceration is a tragedy

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Ino end of solution would be instead of putting people in prison

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
We should bring back

91
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Public whippings

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
So like instead of that's what it was that being sent to prison that's what that's what that's what things evolve to tiny bit yeah

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
But before they did

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
More than one person

95
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Brought the same idea

96
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
And then this

97
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Idea really

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Stuck in my head

99
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
I'd like it

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,103
We we a group of us kind of became obsessed with that and then

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
That's the idea that we decided to base the series on

102
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Anna McIntyre

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Yet

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
All right

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,535
Radiolab

106
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,167
Over the next five episodes were going to turn things over to our senior editor Pat Walters

107
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
It's going to explore this mysterious dangerous idea

108
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
You know all kinds of weird places

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,127
Wakanda series let's make sense in a little bit

110
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Makonnen

111
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
G

112
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
There's nothing I love more than picking the lint off my phone

113
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Well

114
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
It's like a little game built into my clothing

115
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
You're so easy to please

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Before we get started I should say I produced this whole series with Rachel Cusick as she's been a true partner on the whole pie

117
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
Project so you'll be hearing from her Bunch 2

118
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,359
Infants first episode began with a discovery that she made one day when she was looking around the theater

119
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
One of my favorite pages is today I learned

120
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
I'll I do love that I love a good if you don't know this is a section of read it and so I went there

121
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
I'm scrolling like

122
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
Just a general page and then I see a today I learned

123
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,255
Badmind that kind of stopped me in my tracks

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Okay

125
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
T i l

126
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Today I learned

127
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
That it is illegal in state of California to administer an IQ test

128
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,639
To child if he or she is black even when dispensed by school psychologist as part of a professional assessment

129
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759
Wait it says it's illegal to give an IQ test to a black kid in California yeah that's what it said

130
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Do you cook on it

131
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
I totally click on it because I'm looking

132
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
To find out that it's fake for sure so I start reading the comments

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
And they're really bio

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Are Reese's

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,863
They mostly came from a group of people who call themselves race realist

136
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
And those are people who basically say let's just all agree

137
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,311
That white people are inherently more intelligent than black people

138
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,175
Okay so you see these responses you're like

139
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
Can't be real

140
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Like my my head was spinning for a little

141
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Yo by

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
It is the real sons like

143
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
After Rachel found that website we started calling around asking people about this and when the first people we talk to is this guy

144
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
Name is Brandon Campbell I'm so excited

145
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
He's the dean of Student Success at Oakwood University in Huntsville Alabama but back in the mid-90s Branded

146
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
I just got the job as a school psychologist in Long Beach California first day on the job

147
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,807
Shirt and short sleeves and a tie and onions first day of his two supervisors they are

148
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
Took him aside into an office and told him about this thing called the Larry Peru looks like who's Larry

149
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
And why should I be concerned about

150
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
And my supervisor memes like well

151
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Like is a fake chain

152
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Oh man

153
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Well it's basically says that

154
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Any kind of dancing around it

155
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
But he's like oh yeah because of Larry P we can't give IQ test

156
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
With African-American stew

157
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
And are these two white men that are telling you this

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Yes they are

159
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Yeah they are

160
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
Endicott it looked to me like what what do you think

161
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
It like put it in kind of awkward like

162
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Up until that moment they're my supervisor now

163
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
They're at a loss as to what to do and it talked about

164
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
Eventually he says they pulled out a big 3-ring binder

165
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Open data section in the middle Roman numeral

166
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
4 page 2

167
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Initial list of about 20 different IQ test

168
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
That he was not allowed to give to Black

169
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
And I'm reading this stuff and I'm freaked out

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Kinds of bass question

171
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
IQ test

172
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
People still use IQ test

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
Well wake you and I thought there was something that had been tossed out years ago

174
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
The real Beauty

175
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
I mean of course you still care IQ test

176
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Talk about by

177
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Low IQ

178
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
President Trump

179
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
You're going to have a child

180
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
Jordan Peterson IQ 6545

181
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Decide

182
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
But when we started looking into it

183
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
It quickly became clear that

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
IQ test

185
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,735
Kind of all over the place that aptitude test for the single best predictor of Job Corps

186
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Thousands of companies use them to pick employees every applicant entering the military has to take an ASVAB test

187
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
Every branch of the military uses them

188
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
They used in the justice system you are past the 70 Mark you are considered

189
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Smart enough

190
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,959
Do face the death penalty

191
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
Even in football

192
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
And they're kind of massive in school

193
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,175
I'm more than a million kids get IQ tested every year

194
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,319
Do you still need me to figure out which kids will get into gifted programs and which kids will get special ed services

195
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Button California

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
If your kid is black

197
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
They almost definitely

198
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Work at 1

199
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
It's all because this larry pithan

200
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583

00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
The course Larry p is a case

206
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Velocity

207
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
The problem was

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
The guy at the center of that case Larry p

209
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
That was a pseudonym

210
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Any actual guy whoever he was

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855

00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Nuisance

372
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
What's a music

373
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Nonsense

374
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,599
What is nonsense he said really from the very

375
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
The very beginning

376
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
He said he did fine in math but he could not keep up with the reading when I look at

377
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
It's something and I'm trying to read it

378
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
And if I can't

379
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Pronounce it I'm looking at it back

380
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:17,311
The reality was that he had a reading issue sure it's fair to call it like a reading disability

381
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,247
What is nitroglycerin are you okay would you like some water

382
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
It was just like very hard

383
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
Yep what is the most important part that says

384
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
I got it

385
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Kidding me

386
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
So Daryl goes home

387
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
Not really sure what happened but

388
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
He feels like he didn't do well at it whatever

389
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
And eventually

390
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,055
Someone from the school approaches Daryl's mom

391
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
It says

392
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
We need to put your son in a different class

393
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
So the way she describes it in her testimony

394
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,039
Says well I was told that Larry was a slow learner and he needed help you know in his

395
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
School work

396
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
And by putting him in this class

397
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,207
I was under the impression he was put there so he could get more attention

398
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Started going down

399
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Heal

400
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
Intel's new class there were 10 students

401
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
It was mostly black

402
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,239
4 boys 6 girls

403
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
A normal day

404
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
A headache

405
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
A straight-up

406
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Headache

407
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
Custom kids was loud

408
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Some kids

409
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Obnoxious

410
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Some kids

411
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Just in care

412
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Dell says they spent about 10 minutes then reading

413
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Pennsylvania map

414
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
And about five and a half hours

415
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Outside

416
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
And they thought

417
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Calm us down

418
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
So they went on a lot of field

419
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Going to the zoo Golden Gate Park

420
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
What is this

421
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
You know

422
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
They wouldn't teaching this

423
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
You know

424
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
I walked

425
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Schooling cried all the way

426
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
In what about time I got

427
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
Close to the school I straighten up

428
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Got myself

429
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Madonna into the building

430
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
And that was it

431
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
It was that bad

432
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Darrell was in that class for more than a year

433
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
And then

434
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Fast forward

435
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
And when they Darrell's mom is at home

436
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,919
And I should get the phone call but she gets a phone call apparently from

437
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
One of the n-double-acp attorneys

438
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
And the lawyer tells her that a man named Gerald West

439
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Is going to pay her a bit

440
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
He says at West is a member of the association of black psychologists and it's in the way she describes it in her chest

441
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Money

442
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
She

443
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
She said okay and and then Gerald West

444
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
Came over that with Daryl getting a few tests

445
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
And it would he was done

446
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
She says you know

447
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
She says then he turned to me and he says well there is nothing wrong with this child and I said what do you mean nothing wrong with him I'm his mother

448
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
I should know

449
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Time is Mom I know there's

450
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,295
You know there's nothing wrong with him even if she did know that you needed reading help

451
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
She says naturally I didn't feel good about it and I got angry about it

452
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
This is when I really found out what was really going on you know

453
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
And then she's asked what did you find out

454
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
SNL mom says that he's been designated mentally retarded

455
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
That's how she learned that he was in a class

456
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
Educable mentally retarded kids

457
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
She never known that

458
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
What had happened to Daryl when he got brought into that room with the man with the briefcase is that they giving him and I cute

459
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
That's what I've gotten him designated

460
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
And that this is the term that was used at the time until we're going to use it in the story

461
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Educable mentally

462
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
And his mom said he wasn't

463
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
But the test was wrong

464
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
And that I've been wrong about a lot of blackheads

465
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
And so

466
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Darrell's mom

467
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,263
And the parents of five other little kids

468
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
I

469
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,871
Got together and filed a class-action lawsuit against the

470
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
The school district

471
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
Arguing that their kids had been

472
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Scituate denied their education

473
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,831
Viking putting these classes inappropriately because of my IQ test that

474
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Deem them mentally retarded

475
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
And that's

476
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah that's her to the beginning of

477
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Rabbit hole

478
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
So what ends up happening is like

479
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
In the mid-1970s

480
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
These parents

481
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
The IQ test

482
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
On trial

483
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,944
That's after break

484
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
This is Angie Crumbley

485
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
From Fishers Indiana

486
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184

489

Paint welcome back this is

490
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,592
GR8 alive mini-series this episode 1 I'm at Walters

491
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Jad abumrad

492
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,968
You were saying that the IQ test was put on trial that's

493
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
It sort of seems to be where we're driving to Super interesting but

494
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
Before we jump into that

495
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
I think it would be helpful to put the trial and the test

496
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
In a slightly larger context

497
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,144
Okay I answered you that I want to tell you where the IQ test came from in the first

498
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
You mean like

499
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
Who invented all the way back to the beginning of the

500
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
And to do that

501
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
If you go back to France

502
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
In the early nineteen hundreds

503
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
1904

504
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,528
Yes this is Siddhartha Mukherjee I'm an oncologist and I'm also a writer

505
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
In the beginning he has a rose

506
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,392
Out of when I describe them as

507
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Benign intentions

508
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,096
At the turn of the century in France there was a lot going on

509
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,704
The church and state were separating Prime scrape this equal Society

510
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
By the way is David Robson senior journalist. BBC future and the Wolf of the intelligence trap

511
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,712
David says one of the things that happened at this time is the government took over the

512
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
Schools public education was growing Universal education with pots

513
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
Suddenly all kids required to go to school

514
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,000
And within the first few years of this the government noticed that some kids were falling behind

515
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,328
And so

516
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
To figure out what to do

517
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
They called this cycle

518
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Alfred Pinay in Paris

519
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Set the time we've actually the director of it

520
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
Experimental psychology at the University of Paris

521
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,872
Pizza all kinds of things

522
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
But he spent the past

523
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
20 years or so

524
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Studying child

525
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
The French government gave him an assignment

526
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
They said we want you to come up with a test

527
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,952
Predict which kids are going to struggle in school just to identify with

528
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Children

529
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
What moves OneRepublic SMS

530
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
So that we can give the next

531
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,704
I can put them in three years and then when I say Dad is like 3 years

532
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
I know we didn't notice that

533
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,872
He's having a really hard time learning to read or do math Albert but I saw it as a chance to benefit

534
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
The individual people

535
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Diagnose problem

536
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,088
Special hell yeah yeah

537
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,928
Taylor Simone his assistant at the time

538
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
Came up with this test 2

539
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
Look for

540
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
A whole bunch of different cognitive ability

541
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Starting with simple ones bike

542
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Can a child hold a conversation with the teacher

543
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
Moving onto slightly more complex

544
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Such as I'm

545
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,080
He would give the children a list of what

546
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Like how

547
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Fork

548
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Mother

549
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,272
And ask them to kind of recite them back to him from memory middle children draw pictures

550
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
And then he had a few harder ones

551
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
Like name three rhymes for at the French

552
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Word

553
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Riverwalk

554
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,256
Which is like a bow or curtsy

555
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Anyway these questions

556
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Summer easy summer card

557
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
The next thing you did is to give this test

558
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
To a whole bunch of kids

559
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
Crypto page

560
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
And then he compared how they did

561
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Like for all the six-year-olds

562
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
How many questions did they get right

563
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
On average

564
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,784
Seven year olds same thing 8 year olds

565
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
On and on

566
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
For each age he calculated the average score basically I Norm normalization as it were

567
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Calling the normal

568
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
And then you would compare each kids at Newark

569
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,424
So if your six-year-old and you got the average number right and wrong for a six-year-old

570
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
That's your mental age

571
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:51,104
Sick if you score higher than the average for six-year-old your mental age might be seven or eight

572
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
And if you scored lower

573
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:59,040
It might be lower ultimately that would be to a simple math equation mental age divided by the

574
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Chronological age

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
* 500

576
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
K-50 IQ intelligence question

577
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,072
So that's how they do it yeah it's a little different now but generally how it works is like if your six-year-old

578
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,656
And you get the number of questions right and wrong that the average

579
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,984
6 year old got right and wrong your IQ score is 100

580
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,056
And if your mental age exceeds your physical age

581
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
You get higher than 100

582
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
What is your mental age

583
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,176
Is less than your physical age you get lower than a hundred

584
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Sabetha basic idea

585
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
Felt before Bonet teachers and parents and lots of other kinds of people had been trying all different things to figure out how

586
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
And to compare them to their peers

587
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
But this is the first time someone tried to measure

588
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Input a number on it

589
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,008
He was very clear that he didn't think

590
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
He was measuring

591
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
Everything about Intel

592
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
This is not the whole picture

593
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm just

594
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Measuring

595
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Something

596
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
About these kids that helps me figure out

597
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
How they going to do school

598
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Explicit about the fact that he didn't think the

599
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
Mark and his staff should be considered a covenant thing about

600
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Someone tickles

601
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
Brutal pessimism if you type. 1 School

602
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
I do think of it as

603
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
Defining someone he said brutal pacifism

604
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,752
He believed that intelligence was malleable and that the human mind had

605
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
Eunice so many different

606
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Facets

607
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
But had to be considered

608
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,896
He was apparently adamant about the

609
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
But

610
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
As We Know

611
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
Good intentions are the devil's toilet paper

612
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
It's right around the time but name was doing his thing Charles Spearman who is a statistician who and where it where was he in

613
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
What was he doing he was in England it was another psychologist

614
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,216
Neuropsychologist that's different doing research on this topic

615
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,336
I need Charles Spearman who came up with the theory of intelligence that the name

616
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Would not

617
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
Look at your hand by the way my name is

618
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,784
Sure Richie I'm a psychology lecturer at King's College London he's the guy who told me about all this

619
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
And according to him Charles Spearman

620
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Li keqiang

621
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
How to work with kids

622
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Given lots of tests

623
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
And he noticed

624
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,512
Describe counterintuitive thing that in a Hadith

625
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,656
You know I mention that IQ tester asked me many many little test salt lamp together

626
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,728
Like you got vocabulary math all these different subtests

627
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
What time

628
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
Human shows in his

629
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
And I will see you solved

630
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,480
The tests where they all seem to correlate positively together people who to one type of test

631
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
Tend to be good at the mall

632
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
Say I want to see how many words you know

633
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,904
Listen carefully and tell me what these words mean what Spearman notice

634
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Is the kids were good at vocabulary tests

635
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
What is a bicycle

636
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,352
Do kids were also likely to be good at reasoning test I am going to show you

637
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
In which there is a part missing

638
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
Tell me what is Miss

639
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,056
And pattern recognition look here and you will see a star a ball a triangle and other things

640
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
Speed test

641
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,152
Memory tests I'm going to say some numbers

642
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Listen carefully

643
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
All the different kinds of death

644
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
People who are good at 1 or are good at the mall

645
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
And he saw this as evidence of

646
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Sensor underlying mental energy underlies

647
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Their comfortability

648
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
Instrument called the the concept of

649
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:30,752
G

650
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,200
And this idea that

651
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
This sort of general intelligence Spearman notice

652
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
Did other scientist noticed it to know yeah yes

653
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
Verses in the decade since Spearman first noticed this phenomenon has been proven

654
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
Again and again

655
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
And again

656
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,912
To be true is essentially one of the best replication findings in the psychological which

657
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
In the moment

658
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,776
GID I got walked out into the room by Charles Spearman

659
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
This is the moment that Pandora's Box

660
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Ripped wide open

661
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,064
Because out there were lots of different kinds of intelligence is intelligence wasn't

662
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Complicated

663
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
Do justice one kind

664
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,208
Spearman believed we each had a certain amount of it

665
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Sometime we were born

666
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
And if that could somehow be measured

667
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
We're now being used as a social construct

668
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Classified people

669
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
Rather than help individuals

670
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:47,040
This is exactly the same thing they warned against this is that brutal pessimism

671
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,136
Keith never got a chance to speak out against the testing use this way

672
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
He died in 1911

673
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
And in the years after his death

674
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,792
Got the teens and 20s and 30s

675
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
IQ tests were given to millions of people

676
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
Used to decide who should get which job

677
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:12,640
We should be allowed to immigrate to one country or another

678
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
And eventually

679
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
Who should be institutionalized

680
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
And forcibly sterilized

681
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,648
Get the thing we haven't mentioned about Charles Spearman and a lot of these early intelligence scientist is

682
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Are you jealous

683
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,536
And so the whole early history of IQ testing is wrapped up in this ideology

684
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,656
These guys thought they could selectively breed people to create some kind of Master race

685
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,752
And we're going to go deep into that part of the history and future episode

686
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Out with that

687
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
Avila Miller what are the creators of invisibilia

688
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
Type to say once I Q tests were being used to pick people to be sterilized

689
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
It just

690
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Kept getting worse

691
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
The measurement

692
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Was Central

693
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
Do the Nazi Doctrine

694
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,120
Off improving the human race and in their case it marched onto

695
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,240
Exterminate the Nazi version of eugenics started in the mid-1930s

696
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
When did begin forcibly sterilizing and then executing thousands of people that they've classified as

697
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
As mentally ill

698
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Disabled or

699
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
What they called feeble minded

700
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
Meaning that they scored low on an IQ test

701
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,856
This program was called T4

702
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
And it was a precursor to and essentially a training ground for the mass executions of Jewish people

703
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Are over the next several years would become

704
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Hawkeye

705
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
So-so in the span of just about

706
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
3035 year is Hugo from

707
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Something called G

708
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,384
Do selective sterilization mandated by a court

709
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Two selectively extermination

710
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
Mandated by the state

711
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,088
And that happens in the span of 30 years

712
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Given that history

713
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
I kind of expected that after World War II

714
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
IQ test

715
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
Gone away

716
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
No

717
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Here in America America

718
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
Particular around that time in the post-war

719
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
Pierre was a very

720
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Quantitative Society

721
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Economy is booming and we are best with measuring thing

722
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,872
Your height during regular qunar biometrics

723
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,688
Turmeric of weed double down on used bike Utah

724
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Reason for everything to track people you're mocking people for the right jobs making sure they get to the right schools Etc set

725
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:36,000
Petra there is a kind of efficiency clause in this which is you know let's make the society more efficient by

726
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Allocating the right resources to the right

727
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
It's okay by the sixties and seventies mukherji status

728
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
That was the situation

729
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
Did really seeped into the center of American culture

730
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
With the trailer

731
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
Just about IQ

732
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
In the school systems of every state in the Union

733
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,112
One form of intelligence test to another are given each year to at least 10 million children of all ages

734
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
Big impact on their lives can be a normal

735
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,792
What get the trial is right around the time Larry P bumped into the test

736
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
People had finally started to push back against

737
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,424
The Civil Rights Movement was in full swing

738
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,776
Antique group of young black psychologists had stepped up and said hey

739
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Has a problem

740
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Not only because of its history

741
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
But because of the way it's made now

742
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
The test did not

743
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Consider the experiences

744
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,344
And the backgrounds of minorities or black children or

745
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Children who

746
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,488
Did not have a white middle-class background they were culturally

747
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Pacific to European American

748
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
That psychologists Brandon gamble again for him Harold Dent who's one of those young black psychologist who started pushing back

749
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
Back in the 1960

750
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
And think that the problem was

751
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,128
Remember how I told you that I Q test is normed where they give the test to a whole bunch of kids

752
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,480
Encounter scores together to start to figure out the average score for each age

753
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Well at the test makers

754
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
I only use white kids

755
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
If you'd set up one standard

756
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,488
Everybody doesn't meet that standard enter these black psychologists would like

757
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
What about 9

758
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Skip that child is not from that cultural framing at cultural experience

759
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
They may give different answers

760
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,984
IQ test scores did not

761
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,312
Deal with the background and experiences of black children

762
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Which is what this lawsuit ended up being about

763
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,016
I just filled in California today about intelligence quotient test a lawsuit has been filed

764
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
When says that IQ tests

765
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
Discriminate against black children because these tests

766
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,512
Okay take a picture to try to imagine ourselves into day 1 of this trial like what do we know

767
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,912
We don't lose a federal case so it was in US District Court this is Lee running again downtown San Francisco

768
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,056
You know just a couple of blocks from City Hall do you know what the room would have looked like we know from the court sketch

769
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
That right behind the witness stand with a giant American flag

770
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
You know that the the judge seated there next to the witness box

771
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,272
Robert Peckham hiza

772
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Mostly ball

773
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
Gentleman wire rim glasses spoke

774
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,768
Someone quietly you got pick them up at the front and then the lawyers for the families

775
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Number of attorneys

776
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
One thing you just heard

777
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
Armando menocal

778
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,192
Extend the trial Armando had only been aware for about 4 years

779
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
I was the only lawyer that was in court everyday

780
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Myself

781
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,432
And the chief lawyer for the state Rose 12th of October of 1977

782
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
Pokemon for 7 months

783
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,040
10000 pages of witness testimony

784
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
10114 pages

785
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Turn

786
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh my god did you go through all of it

787
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,656
I did but like I whipped through some of it one of the first big things that happens is the plaintiff called this guy named AC

788
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
The halyard

789
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:02,080
The late dr. ASA Hilliard he had been the dean of the school of education at San Francisco State University

790
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,408
The big expert on racial bias in education until

791
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
Yep yep so Hilliard gosip

792
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,272
Dan get sworn in and Hugh

793
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,904
You have a second I'll try to find and one of the family boyars stands up and picked up this body exhibit

794
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Pete 66a

795
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
And walked over to the Sea

796
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,096
And then he says let me hand you this black box and ask you if you can identify this for the court

797
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
Says this is what the actual Beast looks

798
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Books like because of the Beast

799
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Yeah

800
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
And so Hilliard says right this is a kit for the wisc

801
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,616
The wechsler intelligence scale for children

802
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
AKA

803
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
The Whisk which was the main

804
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Test that was being used

805
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
In schools

806
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Okay so this

807
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,392
This is Madden again you're just like explain what this test

808
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
But what exactly is it at Connecticut

809
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
Hilliard says

810
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Right

811
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
Let me try one

812
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,912
There's going to be an actor right so do you want me to reserve a round

813
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,240
But the actors going to come by just have you read a butter stuff okay

814
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
Maybe I shouldn't pick number

815
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,920
The Columbus Day but take this question from a section called general information

816
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
One of the items about general information is

817
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
Who discovered America

818
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,880
And the only two possible answers here on Columbus and Leif Erikson

819
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
And of course there are some people would have a little disagreement with that

820
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,840
Any answers just being like wrong Hilliard brought this one up

821
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,656
Went out that this isn't a test of like

822
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Thinking

823
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Ability this is a

824
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Acquired knowledge

825
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
We give it another day

826
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
Who wrote Romeo and Juliet

827
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Shakespeare

828
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:45,248
Yeah good job thank you and they say Tchaikovsky

829
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
Tchaikovsky's also acceptable

830
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
Tchaikovsky Romeo and Juliet

831
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
See I didn't know that

832
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,768
I didn't know that the people make these tests what explains you at the point of a question like that

833
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Is that a lot of kids won't know the answer

834
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,656
A question number 16 so it's supposed to be hard

835
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,216
The point being on there isn't that like

836
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
Knowing that information in particular is especially important

837
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,896
But the Pacemakers have figured out that the kids who get that question right

838
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:17,248
Are more likely to do well on all the other parts of the IQ test

839
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Because that G Thang

840
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
We talked about before

841
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
The problem is

842
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
There are all kinds of other variables at play here

843
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,280
Like where do you know who wrote Romeo and Juliet

844
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Say something about your intelligence

845
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:36,192
But it might also just be an indication of whether your parents told you about Shakespeare

846
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:42,080
Or whether you learned about him in school what right do we have to expect children from some areas of the country of

847
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Some areas of cities

848
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,688
To spend time studying about Romeo and Juliet

849
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,296
And who argued this acquired knowledge problem affected a whole bunch of different parts

850
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
That would be the same thing here on math

851
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,696
Show me children and not had the opportunity to have good math instructor

852
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,280
They are going to be compared with children who have had good math

853
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Instructions

854
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,400
Then to me you have an economic cultural bias that's represented in there

855
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
The same thing would be true with similarity

856
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Vocab

857
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
For example

858
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
For example you're supposed to be able to answer the question

859
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
In what way are salt and water alike

860
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,712
In what way are salt and water alike

861
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Okay

862
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
In what way do they have to

863
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Comcast

864
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Compounds

865
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:30,720
That make them a thing H2O + NaCl

866
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
I mean I would say I mean the first thing that comes to mind for me is like

867
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,192
Together Rachel you actually

868
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,056
Got the high score right out of the gate okay so here it is

869
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
You get two points

870
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
If you give this answer

871
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,968
A response that indicates that they are both necessary for life

872
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
Or that they are both chemical compounds

873
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
So those are the only two answers

874
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
That you get two points for

875
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,024
If you say that they are both in the ocean you didn't know point

876
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
What

877
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
How do you say that you can drink both of them you get no poi

878
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,544
Points if you say salt comes out of the water there isn't a single right answer

879
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
I'd argue that my answer was just fine

880
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,456
But Hilliard explained that the Whisk favors a certain kind of

881
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,552
There's an arbitrary decision about the nature about the nature of the response

882
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,392
That will give you two points in terms of its abstract he said the wisc

883
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
Arbitrarily favors

884
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
Abstract sounding answers

885
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Like

886
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Salt is a compound

887
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Andy asked

888
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,864
Why is that any more intelligent

889
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
Been saying salt

890
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
It's from the ocean

891
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
This is where the cultural bias

892
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Comes in again

893
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,312
In point wise thinking abstractly in this way

894
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
Is as required as

895
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
Knowing who wrote

896
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:58,271
They argue there are big parts of the test that do measure things that feel way more like

897
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
Your thinking ability

898
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,367
Did the memory test work and just have to read back at you

899
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Numbers

900
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,719
Pattern recognition test that just involve looking at shapes

901
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,815
There's a picture completion test where kids test appointment with missing from a drawing

902
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
But

903
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,399
For every part of the test like that

904
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
There's another part that feels way squishier

905
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,311
And are the test where you see racial bias most blatantly

906
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
Is this one called comprehension

907
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,479
This is Brandon gamble again in with comprehension they may ask somebody kind of a moral Quest

908
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:33,599
Kid is given a hypothetical social situation and asked how they should respond

909
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,159
Like what should you do if you cut your finger

910
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Wire Criminal

911
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,815
Why is it generally better to give money to a charity than someone begging on the street

912
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Or why should I

913
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Promise B cap

914
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
Lorenzo's like a lot of the parts of this nasty questions don't have a single right answer which means they can be biased

915
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
Towards people

916
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,871
Answer the question in the way the people who made the test

917
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Think it should be answer

918
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,271
Which is a big problem if you don't think the way the people made the test thing

919
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,879
Brandon told us about one of these questions that he I ran into when he started working at the school

920
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
Psychologist if you found somebody's wallet

921
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,583
Like sitting on a shelf in a store what would you do with it would you give it back to them you know try to search the mountains

922
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
Find out how to give it back to them

923
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Or would you

924
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
Leave it alone or

925
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,263
Keep that money need correct answer is

926
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
Find the store manager and give them the wallet

927
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
But Brandon Tony

928
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
He would not have answered it that way

929
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,479
I've waited said you don't have and I'm not touching cuz they probably accuse me of something

930
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Because you're black

931
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
And you know what I've been in that situation

932
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,159
I went with a scouting group and my mother was director of The Scouting group

933
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
And we were at

934
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
A science museum

935
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,071
I'm a nerd I didn't realize it back then how much

936
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
When I was

937
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,935
But I was wearing my scouting uniform which had this shiny belt buckle

938
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
So I keep

939
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
Try it it but I get smudges on it

940
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
So

941
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
I'm looking at my belt buckle

942
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
And they're thinking I'm stuck in my pants

943
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
So are you ready gets call

944
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Oggi's

945
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,087
And I have no idea what's going on but my mother does

946
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,903
My mother thinks you're not strip searching

947
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
My job

948
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
When is Brendon says

949
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
If your blackhead and you see that question

950
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
You might think

951
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
Clearly the correct answer is

952
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
Leave the wallet where it is

953
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Really what the

954
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,191
With is measuring is

955
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,543
Assimilation into American culture and how well you assimilate as a predictor

956
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Not so much

957
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
Your actual intelligence and what you know

958
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:37,503
So at the family's footboard a bunch of argument saying the test is racially biased

959
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
And then the state

960
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Get up

961
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
And have to defend

962
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
The.

963
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
And their argument

964
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
Basically goes like

965
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
There's nothing wrong with Tess

966
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
That they are just as valid

967
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,423
You know to use for all the american-born English-speaking kids

968
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,799
Psychology professor at the University of Missouri and it's in a bunch of research on the Larry P case and bias in test

969
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,431
He says it's not enough for test question just to feel like it's biased

970
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
You always have to go back to the data

971
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:15,135
And say what does the data say and does the data bear this out you have to prove statistically that it

972
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,791
And a lot of these arguments the data just doesn't bear it out so it's like take that question who discovered America

973
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,423
According to Craig to prove that that question is biased against the save black children

974
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
You have to give that question to a group of white children

975
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,847
And get the same question to a group of black children and show the black children

976
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,407
Are more likely to get it wrong then the white child

977
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
And Craig says

978
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
The families in Worcester

979
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,391
Didn't do that you know you're kind of going to shooting in the dark a little bit well this could be this could be so when

980
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
Whenever you try that kind of

981
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
Given ad hoc

982
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,767
Explanation for

983
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
What you see

984
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
It's not a scientific

985
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
Enterprise

986
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:04,031
But the reason ironically that didn't exist is because like we said before the IQ test that was given to the kid

987
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
It's like Daryl

988
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
Was only normed with only standardized

989
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Unlike it

990
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,991
And everyone admitted that no one had attempted in the testing companies

991
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
Had attempted to validate the test

992
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
4 black and white

993
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,183
Still Craig says the state argued the families didn't have the data they need to

994
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Prove their case

995
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
Statistically

996
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
But the date of the state did have

997
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Craigslist

998
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
Show that when you give IQ test black kids

999
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,679
You find the entire range of scores that you see in white kids

1000
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
So a test we're truly biased

1001
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:40,639
Against kids because of their skin color their race and you would never have examples of

1002
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,479
Of African Americans who get high scores on IQ test

1003
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,319
And you would never have examples of white kids to get low scores

1004
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:54,463
On IQ test said like if black children can scored very high on IQ test

1005
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
How could they be bias

1006
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
You have the full range

1007
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
But

1008
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Even though you see that entire range

1009
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
You see something else too

1010
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
The means

1011
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
The averages

1012
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
Differ

1013
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,543
I'm group the group the average shift down

1014
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,663
The average score for black kids with lower than the average score of white

1015
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,015
What the results seem to say about Americans

1016
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Blacks as a group

1017
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,855
Scored 15 points lower than whites

1018
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,415
So if the state were saying there's no bias

1019
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
What explains that

1020
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Discrepancies

1021
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,887
One of the first things that people will say that the poor gasoline

1022
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
On the issue is vasayo

1023
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
If you're saying the test

1024
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
Are not biased and that means that

1025
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
This group is genetically inferior to this other huge controversy happening in America at this time over

1026
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
For that very idea

1027
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
An old Theory

1028
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,343
Originally revived by psychologist Arthur Jensen of the University of California

1029
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
Is it better stay that your position has been

1030
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
Black Americans a survey

1031
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
Or not as intelligent

1032
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
Egg white

1033
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
By my definition of intelligence yes I would say that's a fair of State

1034
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,591
And defend the state actually tried bringing this argument into the lawsuit they had introduced it in

1035
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
In some of the pre-trial

1036
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
Paperwork as a possible

1037
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Defense

1038
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
But when they're getting ready to go to trial Wilson Riles

1039
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,183
The state superintendent of Education who was the name defendant in the case and happened to be a black man himself

1040
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Stuff is

1041
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,143
Rapist and disgusting and vile and I can't be a part of that and I especially can't have the state be a part of the

1042
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,495
That depends never directly brought that argument up in trial

1043
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
And that was kind of the ghost

1044
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
In the room and even leave the state

1045
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,943
Funny tried to shuffle that argument back under the rug the family's lawyers wanted to

1046
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Prove it

1047
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Out in the open

1048
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
What we were attempting to prove is that

1049
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
That test

1050
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,903
Mislabeled blacks as being intellectually inferior

1051
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
That Armando menocal again and he says

1052
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
Take out a bunch of different Witnesses

1053
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
A whole parade of experts

1054
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
Medical background

1055
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:12,959
Historians many psychologists many education experts to show in court

1056
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
There's no evidence to support that theory

1057
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
It's just

1058
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Not true

1059
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
And then eventually say

1060
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,663
And there's three times more blacks in classes for the retarded

1061
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,247
It either means a black sword genetically inferior to whites

1062
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,879
Which they just spent weeks disproving or the test of discriminatory eventually get down to the IR either or

1063
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,927
That was our goal in cross-examination

1064
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
And

1065
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
We called every one of the states

1066
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Employee

1067
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,863
As adverse Witnesses and cross-examine them

1068
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,215
And it was one encounter with the Department of Education employee the main guy

1069
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
Within the department in charge of the classes for the mentally retarded and IQ test at Armando says pretty much

1070
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,991
Stop everyone in their track I pretty much got him into a corner where he basically admitted

1071
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
Yes

1072
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
He believed that there

1073
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,951
Were more mentally retarded black people than white people

1074
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
And packing goes wait wait wait wait are you saying you really believe that there are more blacks who are mentally

1075
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
And the guy said

1076
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Yes

1077
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
October 16th 1979

1078
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
Did Beckham issues his ruling

1079
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,831
He just comes right out and says this court finds in favor of plaintiff

1080
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Daryl

1081
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Is Mom

1082
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
Five of the family

1083
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
1 case

1084
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,303
Dependence of utilize standardized intelligence tests that are racially and culturally biased

1085
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
Have a discriminatory impact against black children

1086
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,239
And have not been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of black children

1087
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Into educationally dead end

1088
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
Isolated

1089
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,847
And stigmatizing classes

1090
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,663
For the so-called educable mentally retarded

1091
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,247
He says we must recognize at the outset

1092
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
The history of the IQ test

1093
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,367
And if special education classes built on IQ testing

1094
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,951
It's not the history of neutral scientific discoveries

1095
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,255
Translated into educational reform

1096
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
It is

1097
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
History of racial prejudice

1098
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Social Darwinism

1099
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,191
And of the use of the scientific quote Mystique

1100
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,239
Illegitimate such prejudices

1101
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Defendant's conduct

1102
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,895
In connection with the history of IQ testing in special education in California

1103
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
Reveals an unlawful segregative intent

1104
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:38,879
To dumb it down he's basically saying they they proved everything that they set out to prove

1105
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,951
That this was just a disguised

1106
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
Form of

1107
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
Segregation in under the guise of science

1108
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,607
A group of Black Folk

1109
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Sue the state in one

1110
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
How often does that happen

1111
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Question

1112
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,247
Mrs. Lester how old is Daryl

1113
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Answer

1114
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
Daryl is 18

1115
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Question

1116
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Mrs. Lester

1117
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
I know that you have a plane to catch

1118
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,255
Is there anything else you might want to say

1119
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
If the sum of your feelings about this case

1120
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Lucille

1121
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
Sum it up

1122
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,007
I feel like it was a rotten deal

1123
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
I really do

1124
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:35,199
Because if I had an understanding in the beginning that Daryl was put in a class for the mentally ill

1125
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Retarded children

1126
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
He wouldn't have been there in the first place

1127
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
I would have went further

1128
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,647
I'm taking him to the doctor

1129
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
Find out what I thought anything was wrong with him

1130
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
I feel like

1131
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
To a certain extent

1132
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,679
And even in his attitude toward people

1133
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:01,567
Certain people have changed because he feels like he has been pushed aside

1134
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,175
Feels like he has been discriminated and things like that

1135
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
Come and told me

1136
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,087
And I have to try and straighten it out and tell him what I feel is right about

1137
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:19,231
At the end of the Atkins decision Brenda Campbell says

1138
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:25,887
He put a ban in place no IQ tests are given to black children to make decisions about special education

1139
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,215
In the state of California

1140
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,663
By the time this case ended and judge Peckham issued that band years have gone by

1141
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,783
Daryl the kid who set this whole thing in motion when he was in elementary school was 20 years old

1142
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,575
Wasn't even living in the State anymore

1143
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:49,439
His mom was still had moved the family way after things have gone so badly for him

1144
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Score

1145
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
And that's really the last anybody heard from Derek

1146
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Decade

1147
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Until

1148
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Remind me came along

1149
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
Say it maybe they've been reported we spoke with from kalw

1150
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
Because I should start reporting on this

1151
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
She kept wondering

1152
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
What happened and everyone was saying now I have no idea and

1153
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
To be honest nobody seemed

1154
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Terribly

1155
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,503
Interested you know and I cuz everyone talks about it

1156
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Larry p is

1157
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,575
A case

1158
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
And she was like

1159
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
What about Larry p

1160
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
The person

1161
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,999
Utah she ended up in that little house outside Seattle

1162
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Hanging out with Daryl last

1163
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,095
Everyone who works in special ed in California

1164
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
They all talk about the Larry Peak

1165
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
Which is me

1166
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
Yeah

1167
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
So do they know me they don't

1168
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,847
So and I don't know nobody had ever asked him

1169
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
Not only not I asked him about this nobody had ever really told him

1170
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Like about it

1171
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
This

1172
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,087
And when I came up there and I had the ruling in my hand this was the

1173
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,927
Just the judge's ruling it's like a hundred and thirty pages long

1174
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,463
But it go

1175
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Was my face

1176
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,583
That's my case it was just sort of like

1177
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
Like I didn't really expect this

1178
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:06,239
He was he and his wife were both like happy to have me come up happy to

1179
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
Hear about it

1180
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Really

1181
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
That you're here

1182
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
I feel kind of Honor

1183
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
You know and what actually did happen to him after the ruling

1184
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
So I'm right after the lawsuit was filed actually his mom moved him and his family up to Tacoma Washington

1185
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,975
I moved here in 71

1186
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
Mom was like where I am

1187
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
Yep they had an older brother

1188
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,887
You have been in the military and he was up near

1189
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911

00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
Sew-in weave

1191
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
Moved here

1192
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
I had like a

1193
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Third grade

Reading level

1195
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
And I was in

1196
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
The eighth grade

1197
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:49,759
And then it was time for high school and pretty soon they say we're going to put you in a special lady

1198
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Half a day program

1199
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
What was that

1200
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,367
He was back in special ed program well

1201
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415

00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
Safeway

1205
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
Safeway the grocery store

1206
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,071
And they say yeah

1207
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
I went to

1208
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Safeway

1209
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,655
Had to be there at

1210
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
7:30 and start work at 8

1211
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
And I work

1212
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
From 8

1213
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
Toll lunch time

1214
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Were they paying you

1215
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
No it was

1216
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
Credit for my God

1217
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,991
Wait that's a thing you never heard of that

1218
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:27,391
Eventually his stepfather complained and got him out of that program even though Daryl was like terrified to just be dumped into the

1219
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,487
The general population because he didn't have any foundation

1220
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Not for them type of classes

1221
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
No

1222
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,351
But he was thrown back into General ad

1223
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,143
Without any help

1224
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,239
And I he squeaked by for a few years

1225
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Moving you from grade to grade

1226
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,895
Eventually graduation rolls around I miss my high-school diploma by

1227
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
To credit

1228
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
In

1229
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
.

1230
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
Nockamixon

1231
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Nowhere world

1232
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
After that he moved back to Georgia for a bit and then he started partying a lot

1233
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Drinking

1234
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
Smoking

1235
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Just all kind

1236
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
He definitely had some substance abuse issues for years now

1237
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
So that it was just sort of low and it was

1238
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
A lot of

1239
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,959
Really hard

1240
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
Physical

1241
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,055
Work the best job I had

1242
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Is when I was working

1243
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
Kaiser number

1244
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
Before I got hurt

1245
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,223
Then there'll told me a story that

1246
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,295
Just kind of showed how this thing that happened to him when he was a kid

1247
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
Never really let him go

1248
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
I got hurt on the job

1249
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
I got slammed into a wall

1250
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,559
And threw them back all out of whack

1251
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Currently he had received they sent me a letter I can workers comp decision letter saying that he

1252
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Would be awarded benefits

1253
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
But

1254
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,335
He said he took that letter I threw it in the trash

1255
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,895
I didn't know cuz he couldn't

1256
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Read it you know

1257
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,039
Hard to put in words

1258
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,087
I've lived this long

1259
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
These many years

1260
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,231
Lack of reading

1261
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
You know

1262
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
There was

1263
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,119
Things I needed to learn

1264
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
That I didn't learn

1265
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
And he still

1266
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
I struggle with this sometimes

1267
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,847
I'll be down here by myself so I come downstairs and he's

1268
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
Cream for crying

1269
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,711
And they say grown men don't cry that's a lie

1270
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,039
And I should say

1271
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,111
Daryl life is tough but it's not all bleach

1272
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Has a daughter

1273
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
He's happily married

1274
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,743
CU MIT we grew up together

1275
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
Yeah we grew up in church.

1276
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
Yeah that's how we know each

1277
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
In a choir Are Family

1278
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
25 years

1279
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,007
We've been together 25 years

1280
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Long time

1281
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,871
You know so they both sang in this church choir in that sense

1282
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,455
Bae said he's been clean summer about 18 years

1283
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,759
And so

1284
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
People talk about the case and

1285
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,647
And here like there's this fully dimensional

1286
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Human being

1287
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
That

1288
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
Seems like the

1289
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,511
The case of merely

1290
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
Mingle2

1291
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
My life

1292
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
Might not be like

1293
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
My friends

Nice homes

1296
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
Not to say I don't want that

1297
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
You know because I do

1298
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
But

1299
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
It didn't come my way

1300
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
But I'm content

1301
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199

1302
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223

59 years of age

And the band the band that the Larry P case led to

1323
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
What happened to it

1324
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
It don't life

1325
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Still in place

1326
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
Yeah yeah

1327
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,519
This whole situation that Daryl got caught up in as a kid

1328
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Has

1329
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,127
Completely change the class that he got stuck in those classes are

1330
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
Argon in anything anymore

1331
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
And the test

1332
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
That

1333
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,527
Turn of shovelton into that class is band for black

1334
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
And the judge didn't say

1335
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,903
Banette for everyone or revise the test

1336
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,719
Tobias a tester whatever he said just don't give it to Black

1337
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:51,839
Yeah exactly but if you're white kid or if you're a Spanish didn't get her Spanish kid or ESL kid

1338
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,911
You can take it and that's still in place

1339
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Yeah still today

1340
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
It's like I

1341
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
I hate this word

1342
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,799
I would feel like this word just like

1343
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
Hides all kinds of

1344
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
Things

1345
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
Anyways I just find that

1346
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
China problematic

1347
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
You are not the only one who feels that way

1348
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,951
It is racism

1349
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,487
In school district

1350
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
That's not right

1351
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
It's not right

1352
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,631
In the next episode of the series we're going to return to the case

1353
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
And look at all the weird way that played out

1354
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Now

1355
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,287
I'm also keep wrestling with this idea of

1356
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,895
G the measuring of human intelligence with IQ test

1357
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
Trying to figure out what it really captures

1358
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,783
And learned that despite all of its horrible history

1359
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,879
It was behind solving one of the biggest public health problems

1360
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
The 20th century

1361
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
