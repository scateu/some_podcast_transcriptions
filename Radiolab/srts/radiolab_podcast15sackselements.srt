Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
200k

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Ready

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey I'm Jared

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,344
I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
And we're getting ready

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
For what this whole podcaster about

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Here is an invitation

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
If you join us in the next life

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,768
We will be going

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Not a second year I hate

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
Facebook I hate that everybody knows this

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
Are there so many of them

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
You ladies and gentlemen are witnessing the death of privacy

17
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Yes it happened we thought we

18
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
Anyhow back to the flow

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
And this particular episode is more or less

20
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Invitation for you to get ready for the next episode episode we are working on Fury

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Seriously right now

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
About

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
The periodic table of elements we're going to tell

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Individual stories about the different elements

25
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
The stories are going to take it

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Space

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,856
Deep man-made holes in the middle of America into our cells

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
All kinds of place

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
So this week we decided to make a small

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Telescope

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
Preview

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
In which we go to one

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Apartment

34
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
In one building in the sea

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Occupied by the rather singular

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
Dr. Oliver Sacks

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
We should say this was a visit we paid him about

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
7 years ago I think

39
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,640
This is the story that in a very real way in

40
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Inspired us to do this

41
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Upcoming at the

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
About the Alamo

43
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
I will also know by the way that I love you

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Is intensive

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Right now

46
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Which makes

47
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Perfectly wonderful

48
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Enjoy

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Alpha-gal

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,536
I think that's always been a desire to somehow

51
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Plastic rice and classify

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
The world around us

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
And when you were in

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
I don't know when I can 8th grade when they

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
When the teacher comes in and general science and he pulls down the periodic

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
Table of elements

57
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,368
Yeah I want to be a scientist but not for me but for kids who love this kind of thing

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Oliver Sacks

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
ESO a couple years ago we'd went to talk to Oliver Sacks about something

60
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
Was that supposed to use was going to talk to him and I was

61
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Tagging along for the hell of it

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
For some reason

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
We ended up in his

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
Bathroom

65
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
Maybe to look at a book or something

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
He seems have facts and figures in this is wrong

67
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
. a lot of us in there

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
That's when we noticed

69
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
Elements on the wall in the bathroom

70
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Wow funny

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Periodic table the bathroom but then he said well you know if you go out to the couch you'll see.

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
Embroidered with the periodic table and then he took a Swiss bedroom

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
Where you should assist periodic table comforter

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
On the tungsten

75
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
But the cool part

76
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Was when he took us to the living room

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
We had this describe what it's before us here

78
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,232
Alter a little dictionary Stan on top of which was a beautiful

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
Mahogany boxes

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Find wooden box at the size of a Backgammon set

81
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:53,216
Periodic table of the elements is a very fine wooden and if you can't open it

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
It's a

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Play The Sims where to find wood comes from Russia

84
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Is there a trick to opening it

85
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
Okay we've all seen the periodic table pinyin chart

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
But I was response there there were the usual elements

87
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
We have like 90 some odd little

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Little tubes

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,919
Hydrogen + nitrogen

90
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
2 time for drama having my 72nd birthday tomorrow and element 72 is half an hour

91
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Iraq

92
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
Do what they sound like

93
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
I have coming to me I hope it arrives today and English of hafnium which would be very about tomorrow

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,751
Satisfied

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
I'll be able to hold it in my hand my first love of chemistry have to do with the essential

96
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
Yeah one of the liquid album I love the colors around me Brown

97
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Lobster very very beautiful day the physical properties

98
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
Best trapped in a little vial yes

99
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
Cuz I I I really need to know things really crazy about that box

100
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,359
And this you don't get from from looking at it.

101
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
Chart on the wall is it all those elements

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Ashley

103
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
My everything we can see and perceive this

104
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
Table right here the thief in my mouth

105
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
Sky ocean mountains it all

106
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
Need of some combination of elements from that box

107
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
And the Box itself

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Gives it all in deep

109
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Deep

110
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Order

111
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
I have noticed myself

112
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
I can't help noticing

113
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Elements

114
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Organized

115
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
In a very special

116
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Sort of way

117
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,599
I have managed to not notice

118
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
I find it a little odd

119
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
Then you could organize them at all I don't even know how to begin the process of figuring out there to relate

120
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,167
Well then you are sort of recapitulating Watch

121
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
I know what what everyone felt in the

122
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,335
In the early days question a really early days people thought there were just four of them

123
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
The ancient notion of elements that took the form of

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Basically the thoughts of the whole world

125
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
Could be composed of these four ingredients

126
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Different way

127
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,583
Then in the 18th century was skipping ahead of it

128
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
Small pieces like wind became castles

129
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
Like oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen Earth

130
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
God divided up into things like salsa

131
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Phosphorus

132
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
I am and eventually chemist got all the way down to the root which was the atom

133
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:21,343
That's really what an element is it's a particular kind of atom the problem was though

134
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
When chemists begin to start measuring the atoms they found that they were all different sizes and types like one would be heavy

135
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
Another would be light third one be really friendly likes to link up with other items worth the 4th would be a loner

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
Anyway, combinations like heavy friendly

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Heavy shy light friendly light shine what was the pattern that was the question could they fit all of these differences

138
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,479
Similarities

139
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
Let me hear show you a picture of the

140
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,159
Here's where we get to Oliver's here outside.

141
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,791
I see this cold that will be Dmitri Mendeleev

142
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Over has a black and white picture of him

143
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
His

144
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Habits man is not going to win any

145
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,495
Any beauty looks like a mix

146
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
Strip between the Rasputin

147
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Anthem

148
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
Who do I mean I mean he is a big nose a Shaggy slightly unkempt white beard and mustache the puzzle

149
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
All over the place

150
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Piercing eyes

151
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Thick eyebrows

152
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
And looks like he's in a hunchback position

153
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,023
Generally if you met him on the sidewalk you probably want to walk around it

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
Yucky didn't believe in wasting time going to a barber

155
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,679
The degree of your passion when you look at this man

156
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
You think he's a beautiful looking guy or do you see what I see

157
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
Isaac Mendeleev had a beautiful mind

158
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
And when that mine

159
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Can get Sonic

160
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Train and it was

161
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,247
Is a long life York what's the Moscow

162
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Strange things

163
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
As you're about to hear

164
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
I'll be right back

165
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
My name is Annalise and I'm calling right before going to bed

166
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
In Des Moines Iowa

167
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the

168
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
The modern world

169
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
More information about Saloon at www.starone.org

170
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

171
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
And I'm here because I need your help

172
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
And I request

173
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

174
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
About what we're calling tiny moments

175
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Brilliance

176
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Basically I want to hear about this

177
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,327
Times when a kid you know did something

178
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
It just means you lean back and say

179
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Well

180
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
How do they do that

181
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Maybe it was the moment that I

182
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

183
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
To you

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

185
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,967
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

186
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,831
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

187
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
We're interested in the

188
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart

189
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
It doesn't have anything to do with it

190
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
If you have a story

191
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
T-shirt

192
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Go to radiolab.org

193
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Brilliance

194
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
And record a short Audiomack

195
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

196
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Thank you so much

197
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Hey I'm Jonathan rod

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
Radiolab Oliver Sacks talking about his hero

199
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
Dmitri Mendeleev now

200
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Okay

201
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
In 1860

202
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
Around 1860

203
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
What trains going order Russia Mendeleev

204
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
Could afford to pay claims he was often on in Norman

205
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
Journeys the time since you couldn't do chemical experiments whatever he would take

206
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
Take playing cards with the name

207
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
A various elements that chemical and physical properties

208
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
And he would play what he called chemical solitaire

209
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Sorting them for lightness or sorting

210
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Wanted II don't know the details but you know we can imagine right

211
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
On the trainees looking out the window

212
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Hydrogen and oxygen made of silica

213
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
A shuffling

214
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
What's the pattern

215
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,167
Until one night

216
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
This week in February

217
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Of 1869 he is said to have had a dream and stream all the atoms of all the elements of all the way

218
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
That was a small one dance was everyone's the friendly ones to shine once they all begin to dance in his mind and then

219
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Into a grid

220
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Be woke

221
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
With a vision of the periodic table

222
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:22,399
Dreams wrote on the back of an amp

223
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
The thing about what he wrote on the back that envelope

224
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
It starts out so simply left to right the atoms just get heavier and heavier and heavier

225
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
But every so often while they're getting heavier their other trades

226
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Diamagnetic or whatever those traits repeat

227
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Simple repeating structure you get a table that you can read in a million ways

228
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
There's so many ways to read this table

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,551
Use your imagination

230
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
You can see yourself in there

231
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Shy kid

232
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Weather

233
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
Difficulty forming relationships

234
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
And I sometimes compared myself to the

235
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Inert gases

236
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Inert gas

237
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Their very eyes

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
The baby I could nothing

239
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Because I I felt

240
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
They too had difficulties

241
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Human relations

242
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Button

243
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
I

244
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Just now left the chair in his move to the library

245
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Give me thick

246
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Actually a Dangerously

247
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
This is a handbook

248
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Physics and chemistry

249
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Did you see it

250
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Is 5000

251
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
I had a smaller version

252
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
As a boy

253
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
I'm done

254
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Brooding

255
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
In this book

256
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
It seems to me just pasta

257
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
Did one of the inert gases

258
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Might be seduced

259
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Did the combination

260
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
By the most Act

261
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Element of oil

262
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Which was flowing

263
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
This lonely lonely gas might find a partner somehow do they ever get together

264
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
It came to me with great joy when I found out her

265
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
In the 1960s

266
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
Did ASU Canadian cannabis

267
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
I had in fact made

268
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
A floor light up set on

269
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Elemental

270
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Love

271
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,311
And speaking of Love event tickets come here

272
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
He showed us

273
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Small painting

274
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
In the paint

275
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Then there was this dramatic

276
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
YouTube

277
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Fowling

278
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
On the side of a mountain

279
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,695
Holding two stone tablets over his head in the sky was filled with lightning

280
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
Wasn't it was Dmitri Mendeleev when I heard of how

281
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Mendeleev

282
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Haddam

283
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Discover

284
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
The periodic table

285
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
I imagined Amendola

286
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
SSO

287
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
Going up to a chemical Sinai

288
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
I'm coming down with a tablet

289
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Of the periodic law

290
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
And when I mentioned this fantasy

291
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
To Pisa

292
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Silicon

293
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
My friend a narcissist

294
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
How do you keep the picture

295
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
As a Young Man

296
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
The peak

297
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Are the chemical cyanide behind him

298
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Holding a lot

299
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
The tap

300
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Are the periodic table

301
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
Which raises maybe the deepest question of all

302
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Did Mendeleev think this up and impose it upon the world or was this pattern always

303
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Is there

304
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
In which case mendeleyev just

305
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Remove the veil and set out there you are is the periodic table a discovery or invention

306
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
Is it a human construct

307
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Who is it a revelation of the cosmical Define water is it so to speak God's abacus

308
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Okay so that was our visit with wow did I just get gas

309
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Carried away with

310
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
The sound

311
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
But yes it is a little bit

312
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
The closet cluttered but it's a long time ago was long time ago

313
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
That was a visit to Oliver Sacks

314
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
Add also preview to an upcoming episode that we're making right now.

315
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Which I'm really excited

316
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Hope to be back to that

317
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
In the meantime I'm a witch
