1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
And NPR

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
The word hit us

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
Like your hit with a

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,696
With a bullet

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
I would like that cannot be argued that cannot be our sun

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,216
On Chatham Road by Robert krulwich Radiolab in our story today begins

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
With a boy

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
That boy

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
It's going to vanish not Into Thin Air but to a place that we know very little about

12
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
And if you're the parent of that boy

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
What do you do if your child is

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
Falling away from everything you know how do you find him

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
How to get him back

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,720
So part of this time we got from Ron Susskind new wonderful book life animated some of you may have heard it some not

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Let's start where we run start

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
Began

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
Around 1993

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
And it was an exciting time

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
Well we're going into Cohen's room

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
For what is his last

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Night

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
In the crib

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
ISO Canon

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
You still can't watch it

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
Can you tell us about your crib own

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
Do you like your crib

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Yeah

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Do you know where you're sleeping tomorrow

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
What kind of feather you and Walter going to sleep

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
In 1993 the Susskind family decides to make a big move Ron and his wife Cornelia

33
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Kinder Tucson's Walton Owen wolter is about 5 and Owen is about 2 and 1/2

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
If we decide to relocate from Boston to Washington DC

35
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,432
You know I had to senior National Affairs job at the journal

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Good night

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Say nighty-night

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
The dream job

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
I love you

40
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
Lots of excitement have a nice last night

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,512
So they make the move and as soon as they arrive in washing

42
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
We start sort of noticing something

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
I miss

44
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Their youngest son Owen who

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
That point in a totally normal chatty almost three year-old hitting always

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
Markers suddenly goes sideways

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Maybe the

48
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
Very first thing that happened was he stopped sleeping

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
He stopped sleeping stopped eating

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,808
It was very fussy and it's got to be the move

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
And then we start losing eye contact

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
Then he starts losing motor skills

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
He can't hold his cup

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,840
Slipping out of his hand his gate became very odd

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
And he was sort of

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,704
Look like a drunken sailor walking around the house

57
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
And then he stopped speaking bit

58
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Pipette

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
I bet this is all compressed into a few months

60
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Could have banged his head

61
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
Ingested something toxic

62
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
UniFirst you hit the regular pediatrician and he's gone

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Descendants 2 Center

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
It was a woman there

65
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Who sits them down and she says the word autism

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
The word of the word mean to you at that moment

67
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,400
It meant rain man just I mean I'm a very good driver

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
We saw

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Thyroid that cannot be art

70
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
That cannot

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Our son

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
Yeah it was just terrifying

73
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,784
Now in reporting the story we ended up going off in a variety of different directions but we did visit one place

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
We got a glimpse

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
Just a hint

76
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
What parents like rotten Cornelia must have felt

77
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
We visited the school here in Manhattan called the Rebecca school it's a

78
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Really unique

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
School for children with autism other

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,568
Developmental delay there's little kids in their age for all the way up to 21 every kid

81
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Did you meet in the school is differ

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Autism is a mini mini flavored

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
But the overwhelming sense you get Walking The Halls there is

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
But each of these

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Kids is

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
China

87
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Locked away live

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
Just that they don't know how to be with

89
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Like Kelsey pageant I we got there during lunch

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,215
Hey one of the rooms I don't know who you should describe that we went to this one classroom

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
This one boy who really stood out he's about six years old and he had this big mop of black hair

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
Care and he was just standing there at the table holding

93
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Snapple

94
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Apple

95
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Do you want to eat

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
And just

97
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Hobby

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
And the director of the school team court she was there and she just stayed with the boy and really like try to be there

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Are with him but

100
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
There was nothing she could do

101
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,807
San Jose Apple

102
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
It was

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
Hard to watch

104
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
Because

105
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
You don't know how to

106
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,631
Help him

107
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
So that's the challenge

108
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
There's a kid who'd actually can't tell you what's upsetting to write that's Gil Tippy the school

109
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Is clinical

110
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
Could be that he physically he actually doesn't know where he is in space maybe it's as if we were being

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903
Thrown out of an airplane but you just tumbling you don't know where your body is it's a thunderstorm

112
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
So you only see things in flashes right so now the world is totally frightening totally out

113
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
I mean I do remember the drive home

114
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,519
From that on that terrible day

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
We'll just I mean I just remember

116
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
You know you and I driving home in Silence with Owen in the back

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
And

118
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
I just felt like

119
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Do you know

120
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
There was no

121
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
There's no hope

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,159
Like they had no idea if the Owen they knew was in there

123
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Or if he was just

124
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Kind of lost it

125
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Gone

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,447
But keep in mind this is 1994 we knew even less about autism than we know now we still have no idea what causes.

127
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
But then

128
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,079
The prevailing wisdom seemed to be the kids with autism they couldn't feel emotion

129
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,943
And no capacity to empathize with other people this is way before the neurodiversity movie

130
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
Actually right around the moment when autism was becoming a spectre

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
For the first time

132
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
That's happening and they

133
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Forward to starting

134
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
Barely started the point Owen was

135
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Before

136
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
Was he active or was he is very he was hyperactive

137
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
A lot of self stimulatory Behavior you know hand-flapping running around and Cornelia

138
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
When they would call him

139
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
It was as if he didn't even hear the

140
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
We're hoping he's hearing

141
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
You know it but he's not really responding to you needed them to come to the table or basically have to go

142
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
Oh and leading by the hand or pick him up and bring him over

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
And

144
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
He was down to one word which was juice

145
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
So the only thing he was doing was drinking juice for about a year and also you know there was the Disney movies

146
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,423
But he would sit for he would sit for in for television entertainment

147
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
He wouldn't sit for the whole movie for sure but he would

148
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
That would be the one thing that he would sit

149
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
For quietly

150
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Her.

151
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
You don't know

152
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
Because he didn't sleep so at night

153
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
I was usually up with him

154
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
All night thrashing around

155
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,415
Azan watch one Disney movie after another after another not sleeping at all that word

156
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Juice it seems

157
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Span just a little bit he began to repeat the words you survive

158
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
LG service

159
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Weight loss

160
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Juicervose

161
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
To serve house but you don't know what first what that it all now we think it's juice Cornelius like I said does he seem to want more juice

162
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
He's like no I gave him more juicy this evening

163
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,455
Aaron says he would say that word over and over for weeks and I had no idea what it meant

164
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Until

165
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
It's about a year and a month after the symptoms have started

166
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
One night all four of them are together in living room

167
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
And we're watching The Little Mermaid

168
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,839
And a certain point Owen who's got the remote

169
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Starts

170
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Remaining the movie back

171
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
To rewatch a scene typical so I wouldn't know how to work the remote

172
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Kind of showed him how to do it

173
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
He took to that

174
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
And

175
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,247
He's rewinding the part where Ariel or protagonist

176
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Father's Day

177
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
Wants to become human to get her man Eric Ursula

178
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,535
Says it will it will cost you on The Price is Right

179
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Your voice

180
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
My voice

181
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
You got it sweet cakes

182
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
NFL sudden Ariel and Ursula are having it out

183
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,455
And this parquetry lamp again

184
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Again

185
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,623
Call David Owen stoprewind you just play them

186
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
But after the third rewind

187
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Cradily set

188
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
It's not juice

189
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Massachusetts just

190
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
I said what just your voice at which point I'm like

191
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
Gravel my God

192
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Add Walters like jumping in the bed

193
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,695
Crying and laughing and jumping as a Bailey Chair that phrase for a reason

194
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
That's a weed

195
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,607
That's of course immediately what we thought he's trying to tell us something like he has things to say

196
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
But he

197
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
You just can't say it's his voice

198
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
Another words he's in there he's in there because he's trying to talk to us so we run to the doctor

199
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
The very trusted guy and he's like

200
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Sit down with stalking

201
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
His son called echolalia

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Tackling sound

203
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
That their auditory processing

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,159
Their ability to process sound speech goes Haywire

205
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
And so

206
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
They just repeat

207
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
The sound

208
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
And wishing so he doesn't know what it means

209
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
And he's like probably not

210
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Echolalia

211
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
It's what it sounds like Echo what it sounds like Echo

212
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
I said like a

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Parrot

214
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Do you like you

215
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
So we go from Helen Keller to the pet store parrot

216
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Life Goes On

217
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
End

218
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
Years go by Breeze murmuring a lot of

219
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Gibberish

220
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,111
We might be able to decipher from some movie

221
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Maybe

222
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
By 6 he's got you know

223
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
3 word sentences I want juice

224
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Just seen a one-and-a-half-year-old speech

225
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,167
Coins are full-time 24/7 Ron's working around the clock in a kind of

226
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,495
Frenzy paper all the therapist and we're fighting it out

227
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Basically

228
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Desi tiny tiny bits

229
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
The progress

230
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
But no more breaks

231
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Until on that six and a half

232
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Anawalt

233
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Is 9

234
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
And

235
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Want to get a little emotional on his 9th birthday

236
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
I'm not sure maybe the anxiety of the

237
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Moment

238
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
Attention of it this is Walter Scott

239
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,119
And how old are you now I'm 25 your voice is so much deeper than I imagined it would be

240
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
People usually after like 10 minutes

241
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Cuz their first time meeting me a sandwich

242
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,287
Taking my voice and I have to share them

243
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
Does not affect

244
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Erika Schwartz has his 9th birthday

245
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
His friends come over then

246
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,575
After the party he's out in the hammock in the yard and he's

247
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Kind of crying a little bit

248
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Birthday is it was

249
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
Are they were just kind of strange days for me

250
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,351
Like sensory overload in a way well Owen walks in after Walter

251
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
This emotional

252
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
And we're in the kitchen and he

253
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Seems to kind of look back and forth between the two of us

254
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
In like you there's something he wants to say

255
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
To this point on it only said three words set

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
But in this moment

257
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
According to Rogers

258
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
He looks at us and says

259
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Walter doesn't

260
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
Want to grow up like Mowgli or a Peter Pan

261
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Simple sentence

262
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Colton Colton

263
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Wow

264
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
I'm literally was like a thunderbolt a lightning bolt went through the kitchen

265
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
And I want goes runs off in some you know where every whatever and we look at each other and

266
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Like what that was that

267
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
This is his first complex sentence or thought that's been expressed and it's a subtle one actually

268
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,575
Could you taking three different character two from the movie one from real life and he

269
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Putting them together

270
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Ron Isley

271
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
I got to follow this so he goes up to Owen's room

272
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
And I see Owen on the bed

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Looking at a Disney book

274
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
And I see on the carpet

275
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Are some of his puppets

276
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
And

277
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
In one of them is Yago

278
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
From

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
From Aladdin

280
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,591
The plush toy you know which is the $98 one that goes up to your elbow

281
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
And I grabbed it and I put it on

282
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
On my arm right up to the Elbow

283
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
And I crawl along in the rug

284
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
And I throw the bedspread kind of over my head

285
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,719
Edge up to the edge of the bed and I push the puppet up through the crease in the bedspread

286
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
And so now they're face-to-face

287
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Bowen and yoga

288
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
And I'm looking up to the crease

289
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
My arm

290
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
And I

291
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Talk to him as Yahoo

292
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Now this is an easy voice is Gilbert Godfrey voice I mean anyone can do this I say don't always always

293
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
How does it feel

294
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Beat you

295
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
And he turns

296
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
To the puppet

297
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
Like he's a bumping into an old friend

298
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
And he says Nah Nah.

299
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Good I'm lonely

300
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
And it was his voice

301
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Wow

302
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
And so white

303
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,239
Sato when did when did you and I become such good friends

304
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,847
And he says when I watched Aladdin and you made me laugh

305
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,455
And we go back and forth like this 445 Morris

306
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Exchanges

307
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
And then you're always clears throat

308
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Play card

309
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
Like that and then all the sudden I hear him say back

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
I Love The Way You Lie

311
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Foul little mind works

312
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Is it what

313
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
I love the way your foul little mind works

314
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
That's too far the villain

315
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Yaga's the villainous sidekicks

316
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
Jafar the villain of Aladdin

317
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
That's if that's the next line from Jafar you please anywhere in the movie you ain't asking for me to respond

318
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
As y'all go

319
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
Did you know the next time I didn't know the next line at that point I just jumped out from under the bed

320
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Nelly Hot Like A

321
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
He he is pissed in there and despite everything that they have been told about autism Owen was in there

322
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
And somehow these Disney characters were in there

323
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
With him it doesn't take as long that

324
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,055
You know we start we called the basement sessions where we

325
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,943
Say let's see how far this can go couple times a week we go down in the basement and start playing at scenes

326
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
And we do it the first time we do it with the Jungle Book which is a movie he was in two at that point then

327
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,487
101 Dalmatians Beauty and the Beast Peter Pan

328
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Turn to Stone

329
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
We we kind of ran the gamut I mean pretty much weed watching

330
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
I mean every Disney

331
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
What describe these guys what was it like

332
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
When Mom and I started doing voice of Little Walter

333
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Spell amazed

334
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Zelda maze

335
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,735
Who who was amazed you were amazed with a ride was amazed

336
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
This is Owens

337
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,135
He's 23 now why were you amazed I was so surprised

338
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
By my family

339
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
I could hear them respond better

340
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
You're saying that when when everybody was acting out the Disney movies

341
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Only you could

342
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Hear them better

343
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Right

344
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
So when people when talk to you not in the Disney

345
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
Do what do you remember about how they sounded

346
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
A little weird

347
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Yeah

348
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Gibberish and rubbish

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Do you remember how you felt

350
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
A little worried

351
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
You told Mom wants that you were scared I was scared

352
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
Why did it feel good to watch them over and over again that you kept wanting to

353
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Watch them over and over again how did that feel

354
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Silk comforter

355
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Comforting

356
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Spell comforting

357
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Why

358
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Cuz it would help me with

359
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
Reducing my autism

360
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
How does a movie

361
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Help a boy

362
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Knowing

363
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
Stay tuned and we'll will attempt some explanations

364
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
This is Candice currently calling from her bicycle

365
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Baby Alive is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by Alfred P Sloan Foundation

366
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Enhancing public understanding of science

367
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
And technology in the modern world

368
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,623
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org thank you

369
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,999
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

370
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,119
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

371
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
And I request

372
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

373
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when

374
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
So did something

375
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,623
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

376
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,207
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

377
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

378
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in the

379
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

380
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
If you have a story please share it with us

381
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

382
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
Record a short audio message for us

383
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,463
And that's radiolab.org slash Brilliance thank you so much

384
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
Hey I'm Jared album run Robert krulwich Radiolab in today's story about a kid named Owen and a condition that no

385
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
No one can quite pin down

386
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Now we just heard

387
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
That Owen

388
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
When he watches

389
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
Disney movies he feels comforted and that somehow

390
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
The movie seems to dial down his Auto

391
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Really why would that be

392
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
How can a Disney movie

393
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Make that much difference

394
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56,287
I'm can you hear me okay I can read pretty well we ended up taking the question to this guy

395
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
He's a leading researcher in autism

396
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,175
And yes he is the cousin of this guy is my wife

397
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
And I'm the director of the autism research Centre at Cambridge University

398
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
A couple of different thing first of all

399
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
He says that in the last few decades are whole notion of what is happening in the mind of a child with autism has totally

400
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
We sort of tossed out the Rainman idea the idea that people with Autism lack

401
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Some in our life

402
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
I think that's completely false

403
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,687
It's not necessarily the can't feel emotion or empathy and says not at all it's often a decoding prop

404
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,807
Like they have trouble decoding all of the information is coming in I mean some Studies have found it

405
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
A lot of kids with autism

406
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,391
Literally have too many synapses

407
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
And their brain so it might be

408
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
The world is just coming into loud

409
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,631
I think often people with Autism you feel I have very lost and confused

410
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,495
Desaster little predictability in the social world

411
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
And if people come and go they got no two days are the same people say things unexpected

412
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,295
Levi do things unexpectedly I'm people with oil system seem to need

413
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Weather predictability

414
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
We spoke to Temple Grandin the well-known author and

415
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Autism advocate

416
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Here's how she play

417
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,608
Got a little kid I want to feel the nice feeling being held but there was just too much overwhelming stimulation

418
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
No loud sounds hurt my ears

419
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
Like the volume control on touch and hearing

420
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
Was Wei Wei Wei

421
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,664
Return. And one of the reasons why I withdrew into things like dribbling sand to my hands

422
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
Is a cushion shot out

423
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
The hurtful sound

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,392
As a Temple Grandin explain it to us a kid with autism gravitating to something like bus schedules or

425
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
Knowing every single a fact about every dinosaur that ever lived that is just a way

426
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Slow things down

427
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
And make the world predictable

428
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Happens the same way every time it is

429
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
Simon baron-cohen puts it in Owens case

430
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
He had these Disney movie that you can play over and over and over and over the fact that it

431
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,480
Are insides not just repetition but it's repetition about human action

432
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Where are you out in the Menagerie

433
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
And that creates a kind of structure to be able to look at human behavior and in the real way

434
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,024
World has no opportunity to rewind the movie

435
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
Where is in the world of movies you can watch the same Disney cartoon a hundred times Arthur

436
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Thousand times when you could pull my sky frame by frame like a literary critic

437
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
Horror film critic you can really analyze the action to understand okay that's what happened.

438
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
What caused him to do what he did

439
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Add to that

440
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
The element of Music we spoke with a

441
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
Geraldine Dawson Neuroscience Professor Duke guess that maybe it's not just the repetition that made the difference but the repetition

442
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
With music one of the things that we've learned from Neuroscience is that music

443
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Nick activate

444
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
Emotional centers in our brain and in fact

445
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,248
It's pretty reliable that certain kinds of music make us feel

446
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,088
Frightens make us feel

447
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
Happy make us feel worried and so forth

448
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
It's a done brain scans of kids with autism

449
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
They found

450
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
That during kind of normal interactions people with Autism don't necessarily activate those emotional

451
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Centers of the brain areas like the amygdala but during the experience of music

452
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,784
The those areas of the brain did become activated in a way that was

453
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
Very much like a typical person

454
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,976
So it might be that while Owen was sorta forensically examining these moments of Disney movies

455
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Who's the Disney music

456
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
That was binding those moments

457
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Feelings

458
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,960
So you know like when a person looks like that that's when they're happy when a person looks like that

459
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
That's when they're sad

460
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,360
However works Simon baron-cohen thinks it's at least plausible

461
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
That is using the movie The scaffold to make sense of the month graczyk

462
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Complexity of natural life

463
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
And that's what got the runs

464
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,744
Play this is a whole new planet hearing that maybe this

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Disney ish therapy that they use without on

466
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
Might be a whole new approach to treating kids with autism instead of the one-size-fits-all model of sit in the class

467
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
I hear the things you're supposed to know

468
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,104
To be a working member of society and said it's like go with their passion

469
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Follow them in there

470
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
It's it's a pathway the brain finding away

471
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
To get to what people need which is

472
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
Interaction and emotional wholeness

473
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
I want to sing the song for them

474
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
Seaweed is always greener

475
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
It's a buddy assist Lake

476
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:12,448
Eugene Public School wake up their product has a big Miss steak

477
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Does Ducati

478
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,616
Who are the ears sometimes down in the basement with the family or sometimes even in doctor's office is Owen started

479
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Improvise

480
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
Keep go off script

481
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
And use the characters you knew so well to explain

482
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
How he was feeling under the sea

483
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:34,720
Dollies with the dog bed is way to take you from me

484
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
And I were thinking about all this

485
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
And asking ourselves if this works with Disney movies

486
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
Put your very emotional in

487
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Fear

488
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
What are you how you do this with paper clips

489
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
Bus schedule

490
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
Questions kept coming

491
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
We ran into inevitably

492
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Counter-reaction

493
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Gerunds

494
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
This we didn't expect

495
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Story

496
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
It's great it it's a wonderful story

497
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
But the fact is most I mean wanted

498
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
The danger with a with a book

499
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
With any book including life animated is that is going to

500
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
Give the impression to a lot of people that this is the answer

501
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
That psychologists and journalist David Rico he warned us that like with autism we still don't really know

502
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:23,872
And we don't have yet and a body of establish science and Aliana cook your hearing

503
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
They're just attic.

504
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
If you known

505
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,016
One person with autism you've known one person with autism

506
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,136
Daddy says it's really all you can say and to take one person's experience and generalized on it

507
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
It's a mistake

508
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
Vacation point is sunburned when is turning 21 years old today oh my God happy birthday to him

509
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
Sendai

510
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
Ben is never going to be able to live independently he's never going to have what anyone considered would consider a

511
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Grateful in normal life

512
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
Ben has severe autism and is now living in an assisted living

513
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
He was diagnosed around the same age is Owen

514
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
Same basic symptoms of lack of eye contact suddenly

515
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,416
Speech fascination with spinning wheels with ceiling fans the whole the whole package

516
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
Dave says he and his wife tried every therapy they can afford

517
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
What they couldn't

518
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,096
But then never had any of those big breakthroughs

519
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
He said he was a teenager

520
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Cherrywood hit any wood scratch new wood bite me with

521
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
Continue with Kik honestly I was always afraid one Karen and I would end up having to go to the emergency room for some reason that

522
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,688
If they saw her arms that they would arrest me because I would think I was

523
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
Some horribly abusive person because her arms were nothing

524
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
They were covered with

525
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,928
With scabs and scars and scars on scars and on top of that

526
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
You know there be the crap

527
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,352
Play like he was not

528
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Well

529
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
I hate to say it but here we are in his 21st birthday and he's still not 100% reliable when it comes to

530
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Honestly the reason we ended up calling David's because he wrote a review of Ron's book where he said basically the Great Book

531
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
But it's just one more story of a triumphant

532
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,392
Happy ending in that is not the norm for many many people who experience autism

533
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
You don't have happy endings

534
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
I mean that's that's a sad fact for many of these families

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
And we're not expecting in our life

536
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
A happy ending for Ben

537
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Sheeple

538
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Seem to believe

539
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
That

540
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,824
That it's dangerous for parents to have too much hope

541
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Because what if

542
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
They really think it's possible for their child

543
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
Progressive huge amount will recover and then their child doesn't

544
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
We have the other concerned that's Ron Kaufman of the autism Treatment Center

545
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,440
Great America we find that we're not afraid of so-called false hope

546
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
We're more concerned about fall specimen

547
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
And here's what he says.

548
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
In 1981 Randstad

549
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Barry

550
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,544
And on over with tips down on a local TV show with a very young Oprah Winfrey

551
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
How do you describe suzhou

552
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,968
Okay we had a child who is diagnosed as unsure of the ill or hopelessly L something

553
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Gold watches

554
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,576
He tells how it a really young age a year-and-a-half older son

555
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Began to regress

556
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Dentist

557
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Clap hands

558
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
Lose I contact Rock back and forth and then one day

559
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,096
His wife decided you know what we're going to just sit down on the bathroom floor right next to him and we're going to rock back in

560
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Imports just like

561
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
He explains that they did this

562
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Over

563
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
Over and over hour after hour to one day

564
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
His son turned his head

565
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
And he actually looked

566
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
At us

567
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,688
It took 900 hours before

568
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
He ever gave us

569
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Eye contact on its own

570
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
When he looked at us

571
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
We cheered

572
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Cried

573
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,768
Just that was really think for us

574
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
So somebody else might look at us

575
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
You crazy

576
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
But we're not

577
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
We just got this little boy just fine hundred

578
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,824
Freaking hours but he just looked at us for 3 seconds my

579
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
God

580
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
And he went from that to a little boy now who functions on a near genius-level who talks as communicative is

581
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Loving is embracing little boy

582
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Is Ron

583
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
For me it just felt like my mother was

584
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,768
Loving me and enjoying me and playing with me nowadays interviews run

585
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:31,168
Seems to say that maybe his parents cured him a lot too so I actually have never used the word to write

586
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
I don't use that in my lectures YouTube is not no one's ever actually heard me

587
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
You say that what I do say

588
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,872
Is full recovery which is essentially the same thing

589
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Whatever you call it armed with his heroic story Ron and his dad Barry now running autism treatment program they call

590
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Sunrise

591
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Som

592
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
People come here from all around the world

593
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:56,256
What's a my child is severely autistic and I will smile and I'll put out my hand

594
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
Don't shake their hand and I'll say

595
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,120
I am so excited for you

596
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
Wow you are so blessed

597
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
You know what the store to do

598
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Decry

599
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
And I say why you crying

600
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,176
No one ever said that to me you really say that two parents with a severely like severely autistic

601
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,784
Severely I say it all over the world

602
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
You know last year

603
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
There was a woman and Kelli Stapleton

604
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Who was a

605
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Fairly prominent autism blogger

606
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
And I gotta know Kelly a bit kiss a daughter with autism in one day when her daughter was 14 she locked herself

607
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,336
Funny van with a couple charcoal burners in in tried to commit suicide with their autistic daughter

608
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
In the world of autism more than I can't think of any other place you see it

609
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Believes that one of the reasons you see so many suicides in this community and by the way there's a huge debate about this on the web

610
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,464
But he believes it one of the reasons you see it so much

611
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,792
Is it all the success story seemed to say to parents like him

612
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,352
Did as hard as it can be in it.

613
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Really hard

614
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
You're not trying hard enough it's depressing

615
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,032
You're a new bumper sticker other than showing up

616
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
The autism is awesome and awesome spell like a you some like can't like

617
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Saint Laurent

618
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
I know you want to

619
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
It destroys lives

620
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,112
Is is what it does in our definition of it

621
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
And that's one of the things that makes it

622
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
Very very confusing for people outside the community to do

623
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Describe what's going on

624
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
You know how this

625
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,864
Situation were obviously autism suspect

626
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Do you have all of these different kids

627
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Describe

628
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
By the same word

629
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
Making things even more confusing to take a child when they're too or

630
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,712
Free butts Temple Grandin again to kids that look real severe

631
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
And I look real severe when I was

632
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
When I was three

633
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Real real severe

634
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,160
And then you work on these kids lots of one-on-one therapy

635
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
And one kid two kind of pull him out of it

636
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,024
And the other one you're not able to pull them out of it

637
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
And they both look the same at Age 3

638
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
So if a lot of these kids

639
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,960
Start out with the same set of symptoms they end up in vastly different place

640
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
No one knows why

641
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Vanessa Paradis

642
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
You really

643
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
Have no idea what is going to happen

644
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
How much

645
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
You can dare

646
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,296
Notions of

647
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
What could be up the road or what should be now if they pop into my head which is rare eye

648
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
I dismiss them

649
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
I have absolutely no idea

650
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
Because we have been down so many roads

651
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
That were disappointing

652
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,544
Panda

653
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
That's next

654
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664

Robert krulwich Radiolab in the story after Owens

663
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,272
Disney basement sessions has really taken off in the Disney therapy as it were

664
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,856
Seem to be working and was getting better and better and better

665
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Things

666
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
Took a turn at end and not for the good

667
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
Remind me how old is this point

668
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,352
14-14-14 9th grade

669
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,240
I was 10th grade 10th grade

670
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
And what what happened

671
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,664
We didn't know what was happening you know we just saw over the months at Owen was

672
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
Really out of sorts

673
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,040
You got quiet and withdrawn basically stop doing Disney

674
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
Over this. He's losing a lot of weight is not sleeping the three of us were scratching our head saying what is going on with

675
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,536
Oh and he is really moving into a bad place I mean I was

676
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
Actually worried that it was becoming schizophrenic

677
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
Do something is wrong with them and we couldn't get it out of him

678
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
This is Owens older brother Walt again and he says when he pick up Owen

679
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,176
School you're shoving self you talk to him so I pick him up

680
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
You talked himself in the car and it be no floater

681
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
You know it's not true or something under his breath and then at one point I overhear him

682
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,952
In a kind of conversation

683
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,608
With still the sidekick of Hercules in that movie Hercules Danny DeVito does The Voice

684
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
And Phyllis can always listen kid

685
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
You can take them you're not you're not to stand up for yourself that kind of

686
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
Thing that Ellen was saying and I didn't

687
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:02,432
I didn't know where to fit it in wrong. It seems like only was trying to psych himself up for something

688
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,016
Switch on the couch and a grilled them for an hour

689
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,344
Until eventually I won told him about his music class

690
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,232
It's cool there two kids in this class who red kids emotionally disturbed kids so they're not

691
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,328
They're not on the autistic spectrum and socially there very

692
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
On Target

693
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
And they

694
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Basically

695
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,032
Torment and terrorize him for

696
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
6 months

697
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
Of that school year unbeknownst to us

698
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
And unbeknownst to the school

699
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
What did they do

700
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,064
They sat on either side of him and basically said you know

701
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
We're going to kill you we're going to kill your parents

702
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
Two bullies

703
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Leiden

704
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Bullying me badly

705
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,400
I mean right then you were in a very bad spot and couldn't tell me your mom or anyone

706
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
All right because what happened the police said what

707
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Burn your house down if what

708
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
If you tell

709
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,176
And Owen was so literal as are so many autistic kids

710
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
She believed that they literally meant they were going to come and burn his house down but there's an extraordinary MoMA

711
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,648
Pain in the middle of this where Walter picks him up

712
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
And Owen starts to think go through a calculus the bully said if you tell your parents

713
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,144
About what we said will bring your house down but they said nothing about your brother

714
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,776
And so is he seems like an opening

715
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
So did you tell him

716
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,592
No I didn't

717
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
No I didn't I

718
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Why not

719
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,712
Does I'm afraid he would beat the mop

720
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
I didn't want that

721
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,088
Walt at this point you know is a football player and

722
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
You know what he looks like Hercules to Owen and

723
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,256
Oh and later describes to us this thinking

724
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
That if he tells Walter

725
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
That Walter will

726
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Hurt the kid

727
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
And maybe kill the kid

728
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,872
And in Disney none of the heroes actually kill any of the villains

729
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
No

730
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,736
Walter was the hero you were afraid he was going to do what

731
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
Kill but it's wrong

732
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,904
Did you ever talk to Walt about it a little bit later after it happened

733
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
I just never finding out

734
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Like a combination of like

735
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Rage and helplessness

736
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
That

737
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
I literally just thought

738
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Of what

739
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
I would have gone to that kid

740
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
If I wanted told me

741
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
I really wanted to kill that kid

742
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
I mean

743
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Ditto

744
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
I'm his protector

745
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,840
In a way you're you are kind of Walter was worried about protecting you in that time

746
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
In a way it was

747
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Me

748
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
That was doing what

749
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
Protecting myself

750
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,592
And who else and my brother Ryan and Walt and Walt

751
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
You're protecting Walter

752
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,296
So here you have this moment we're at look like Owen was sliding backwards but according to Ron

753
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,856
It might have actually been his greatest Leap Forward

754
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
His most profound moment of empathy these days when is 23 just turned 23

755
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:34,144
A few months ago and are you in love right now yes I am with the girl made dreams Emily

756
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,728
She and I graduated

757
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,080
From review last month this has been a three-year

758
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
Program called getting ready for the outside world and so he'll be graduating from the

759
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
From the entire program

760
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:57,184
And off on his own and now me her and our other two friends John and Julie also go to school

761
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Are all going to move

762
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,536
And live a life and Hyannis

763
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
What is wife

764
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,216
Living independently forever or what is it what kind of adult Independent Living Program

765
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,640
As we were talking it was hard not to wonder how independent will Owen be because

766
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,688
That's the question that's in front of the SS

767
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Especially with

768
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
I think what scares me

769
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
Sometimes it is

770
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Kind of

771
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Just having to go it alone in a lot of ways

772
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
And

773
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
At the same time just

774
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
Being there for

775
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
Sorry

776
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
There's some

777
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,200
Thought think things ahead of you know

778
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Goals have to be ready to

779
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Take these things on

780
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Kind of

781
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,856
No wonder you don't like birthdays

782
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Well it's a tough one

783
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Amy Walters like

784
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,144
And I said to me what pain is like is it always going to be Disney

785
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Lemmy forever

786
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Oh my God on that wall

787
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
But we talked we talked to him about you know

788
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:23,712
About everything about you know our will and who will be Owens

789
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
You know how he figures into everything all the efforts of her we're trying to do and have been doing for all this

790
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
What time is 2

791
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,952
One of my favorite movies is the Jungle Book

792
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
Cuz mowgli's

793
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
It's his quest

794
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,376
With his animal Sidekicks to get him to the man Village

795
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,728
What we've been doing all this time and what we're still doing and we do everyday

796
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,336
Is to bring on closer and closer to that man Village the

797
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
We all inhabit

798
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,479
There's so much hoping that in as he progresses you feel so good about it

799
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
But at the same time

800
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
That's not to say hello

801
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Ever totally get there

802
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
It's hard as we might try we

803
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
We may not get him there

804
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,751
But that doesn't mean you you leave him on the path you

805
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,567
Stay with them on the past even if

806
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
