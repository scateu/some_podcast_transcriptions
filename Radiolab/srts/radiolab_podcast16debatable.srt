Is Avery shaped it reframed it

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
Into something even weirder and more different

42
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Weirder

43
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
No way I'm not weird bad.

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Interesting

45
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And debate lingo that's a link

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,928
That's a link usually when you run a criticism the link is the

47
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
The thing that they've done

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,376
Oh okay

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192

Okay so the world that were talking about witches

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
The center of this

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Obviously debate

54
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Yes high school debate and College.

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
Now I have an elevated the base but from the outside it always seemed like this

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
Hyper-competitive

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,184
Brainsport accordion briefcase where they have all these

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
Miles in there with all the research and they go to these tournaments

59
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,864
And they argue about some topic back and forth and back and forth and back and forth

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
Note the interesting thing about the bay I didn't know this

61
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
Beforehand is it the people who do this

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Stop & Go on to become

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Hugely powerful people you don't Supreme Court judges

64
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
President

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Leading thinkers Scholars Titans of Industry the farm team of the big folks for tomorrow so Lee Iacocca from Christ

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,112

00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Malcolm X they all were debaters

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Today

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
This is Ryan

70
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Story Ryan washes

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Story of debate

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Actually

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Ryan Street debating

74
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Yeah yes

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
And the story comes from reporter Abigail

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
Killed before we get going so let you know there is

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Strong language in the story

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Profane words

79
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Skip it if you need to

80
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Otherwise

81
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
Is it biblical for jumping right now

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
I would love to know Ryan like

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
What was your life like

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Before you

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Wherever on Adams

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Well Kansas City Missouri in the city

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Public school you know

88
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
99% black students

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
I was actually tricked into debating

90
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
I really had

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
When was it when it when was this so we're talking about

92
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Oh well

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Mm I'm sorry I'm old

94
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
2005 when were you born

95
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
If you send your old 1990

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,504
But yeah

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
I ended up getting tricked into the bay

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,904
I'm almost definitely a more of an observant person which is why I like to play the game of chess

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Because

100
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
You know how people move their pieces the time

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Listen to move their pieces all gifts

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
You know something

103
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Fairy tales

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
And so I was tricked into the babe

105
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
By playing chess

106
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
And I ended up winning the school chess tournament that we had and

107
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
This little short German redhead lady

108
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Name Jane Reinhardt

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
I came to

110
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Chess practice I ended up being present

111
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
Temperatures practice one day and put me in the hallway on

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
I understand you you know you were chess champion and that's a really good thing and we had this debate program and I thank you

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
I'd be really good at it

114
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,791
You know anybody who can critically think a chance to critically think

115
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Yeah yeah I don't even know what to say was

116
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
No no

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Fat

118
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
So over this

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
Next year she kept on telling me it's just like I thought I told you to join the pain I thought I told you to join today and I was like

120
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
I thought I told you know

121
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
I can spot a debater at

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
20 pesos

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,087
Okay you think I'm playing so 1 Monday I came to school she handed me a p

124
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Piece of paper it was a revised schedule she had my schedule changed

125
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
To where I had the bait first

126
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Sour

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,863
Here you are

128
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
A lot of eye debater

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
I just come and kind of days

130
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
My schedule got changed

131
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Okay that's fine

132
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
That was first day of classes Ryan's learning the basics of

133
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
And in this kind of debate that he's doing school policy debate

134
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
There's two teams and two people in need

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,647
Usually the debate is about some kind of national policy

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Like

137
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
The United States government should increase

138
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Economic engagement in

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,375
One team at the beginning of the debate is randomly assigned to be affirmative

140
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
And that means they're supporting

141
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
.

142
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Who sang yes the United States federal government

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Should do that

144
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Here's why

145
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
The other team is the negative

146
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
And they're arguing against

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Different

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Both of those ice maker

149
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
The judge decides

150
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Who made the better record

151
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
I mean I get him up debating

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Almost daewon

153
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
We ended up having mock debates in class like Pepsi verse

154
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Cisco can you know

155
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Family Guy versus

156
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
The Simpsons

157
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:34,495
But that sucks it wasn't very fun it made us learn how to do impact

158
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Impacted

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
Analysis

160
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
So for instance

161
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Let's say you're debating apple versus orange

162
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
If I say the rinds

163
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
If apples are necessary for the fertilizer

164
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Produce Orange

165
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Just so you must go for apples

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Impact of choosing apples over oranges

167
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
You have to be able to compare the two and make art

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
The traditional stand for

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,887
Is rain started learning all this impact analysis Holman's model of argumentation

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
Started the Depo Palace logo if you really well

171
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Yeah he did

172
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,383
Tournament is one of those activities that afford you the possibility of traveling places

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
Where I grew up and went

174
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,271
The school I mean students didn't leave like a 40 block radius for their entire life

175
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
If you're in control and activate

176
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
And everybody's listening to you

177
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
And

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
I think it's

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
It's important to feel that way even if it's only an a

180
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
60 90 minute debate

181
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Ryan needed those win

182
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
He needed

183
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
I was enjoying

184
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
That affirmation

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
The thing that helped me out was that

186
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
My first

187
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Tournament

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Was

189
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Anime canvas in eternal

190
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Debate Kansas City is urban debate league

191
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
And so we were debating other kids from the same neighborhood

192
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
What's the difference

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Schools

194
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And so that environment

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Of debate was

196
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
To me very different like yeah we wanted

197
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Knights win

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
But there was a lot more, ratterree in the debate

199
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
And so to me by the time I went to my first national

200
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
I was very much

201
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
But once I went to that national tournament for

202
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
First timeout

203
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Okay I don't know

204
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
National Tournament

205
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
You're up against what I call name brands

206
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,087
Predominantly private schools and so we were really excited about that but I will dress clothes on

207
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,975
Bakugan the bus started kicking a little bit just by going to the Bay tournament got off the bus went inside

208
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
And then

209
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
We went to the cafe

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Syria

211
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
And when we open the door to walk

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
.

213
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
The room

214
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Pilot

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
I mean when I tell you the talk

216
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Wingstop literally

217
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
300 other Plus student

218
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Stopped and stared at us because a bus

219
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
The Blockheads

220
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
MAA like watch

221
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
That's the whole time

222
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
At least that's how I feel

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
You know but

224
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
We walked over to our table

225
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Look like

226
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Do not worry about them

227
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Pull out your things

228
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Get warm.

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
And so

230
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Got our stuff pulled out

231
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Starting to practice

232
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
They started

233
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,439
Yeah whether they were Whispering about the bait stuff for about us I don't know I wasn't in there

234
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
I can definitely explain to you what that felt like

235
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
It was real

236
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
And making things even more awkward and more uncomfortable

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
The ball is that when the debate actually got going and this is particularly true at the national level

238
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
This

239
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Is wet debate

240
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
It sounds like

241
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
What is it

242
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Sped up

243
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
This is what do they sound like today

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
What the goal of speed-reading are spreading if you Willis to get more arguments

245
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
And apparently and this is like

246
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Digression

247
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
This kind of thing actually started in like a 19

248
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
60th and the students are actually the ones

249
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Uber driving

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:39,487
What are things that makes debate such an interesting intellectual game is that it's much more of a bottom

251
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
Up driven activities in a top-down

252
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
Activity director of debate at the University

253
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Arkansas

254
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
In the case of speed

255
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
We evolve the situation where

256
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
One team decided Well I'm going to

257
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Presente Target

258
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
The other team

259
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Talk slower and Aaliyah

260
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
You didn't answer two of these argument

261
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
So

262
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
You lost a debate because you didn't answer those really well we need to answer all eight of those arguments

263
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Has gone way too far

264
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,167
It's not as if you didn't know how to do that

265
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
That's the way I've debated I did try to

266
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
But he says

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
Somewhere around the first national tournament

268
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Just kind of stopped making

269
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Like the fast-talking

270
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
The fact that

271
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,063
Yadada babies super you know highfalutin topic

272
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
I felt as if

273
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
I could never take any of

274
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
The stuff that I learned

275
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Intubate

276
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
And take it back to 33

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Askew what

278
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Where I live

279
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
And this isn't just you need to ride

280
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,679
I mean what you say at the stage in debate is that a lot of kids like especially Inner City

281
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Kids from public schools black students

282
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
You know they just start to drop out of debate at a certain point

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Ryan

284
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Brian didn't do that

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Now something big is going to happen

286
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Somebody's going to say

287
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
No what happened was it stay at a student from University Academy and she was a senior

288
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Her name was marshawna

289
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
And she went

290
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
She came over and asked around heart

291
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
She needed a partner there was about to be this tournament called

292
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Casey Casey

293
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
FeFe

294
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
TLC tournament

295
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
The big high school debate tournament and marchioness

296
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Who's older than Ryan but

297
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
She needed a heart

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
So

299
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,943
Changing Rinehart and Jane said well

300
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
So met with marchon eyewear

301
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
What's the first day before

302
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
The tournament happen

303
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
And I pulled her into this room and I had Oprah had

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Three boxes of Evan

305
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
You know and I was ready to go with me

306
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
The topic was whether the US

307
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Increase participation in

308
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
National service programs

309
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Peace Corps

310
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Armed services

311
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,959
And I'm like all this is the stuff that I've been working on that shoulder the learning serve America stuff I had this

312
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
Find Peace Corps affirmative that I hadn't wrote yet

313
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Statistics on them

314
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
You know and she was like

315
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
Yeah and so she hadn't made this expando and was just like okay

316
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Take this folder

317
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Go home

318
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Study it but I got home and I open this

319
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Expand Ln

320
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
With all of this

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
It was full of things and I stayed up literally

322
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
All night

323
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Studying

324
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
File

325
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,423
I mean it was not a lot of evidence there was not a lot of pre written out answers to arguments there wasn't a lot of that

326
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
There was some things that were there was Ralph Ellison I am

327
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
And invisible

328
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:39,711
There was a clip from Ralph elephant you know Invisible Man in there there was

329
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Lithium desert Twisted line

330
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
Maya Angelou poem in there

331
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
But still like that

332
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
There was some original stuff that she wrote

333
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
And I'm like I

334
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
I didn't get it

335
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
But she was kind of told me you know let her

336
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
And I'll drive the ship

337
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
You just ride along

338
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Okay

339
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
So

340
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,359
Next day we get to the first debate I still was very unclear when we arrived at the tournament

341
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Just was going on

342
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
Get to the classroom and standing

343
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Other side of the room

344
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Are there two of them

345
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Are they white kids mostly yeah they were white guys in

346
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Suits with Republicans

347
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
If you want to know if you wanted images

348
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
The other team there affirmative

349
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
So big

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,727
And they're like

351
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Service programs

352
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Broad

353
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,663
SI she gets up to give this speech in that starts with this like

354
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,063
4 minute long piece of spoken word

355
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Speech kind of about her personal experiences to be this way of speaking

356
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Was very

357
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Passionately Force

358
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
It made people.

359
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
They stop writing they stopped talking

360
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
In the middle of this riff

361
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
Marshawna laid out this Ark

362
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
That the style of debate

363
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Did they engaged in that fast pace

364
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Form of debate

365
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
Was exclusionary because it demotivated minority

366
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Students from participating

367
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,575
And not only that like it also creates this

368
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Resorts in Bali

369
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
Because if you're going to start

370
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Debating with

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Ton of argument

372
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,887
Help researching those arguments so you pay people and you paid coaches help you make those arguments and that's clearly favors

373
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Rich and affluent schools

374
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
And beyond that

375
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Marshawn argued

376
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
Even the language itself setup a norm of what counts

377
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Intelligent

378
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Authoritative

379
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,015
For instance like men's voice to be held up over women black people to always seem angry and rude

380
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
I'm going to just being passionate as if they don't

381
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,463
I feeling you know it was a criticism of the auctioneer style of debate it was a criticism of the insular lingo up

382
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Debate over the criticism

383
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
Of the way in which debates were decided socially and politically as a

384
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Opposed argumentative

385
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
So

386
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
I was like I was like okay I can use it with you

387
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,735
No I wasn't shocked I was like I was like I was like damn ever the greatest

388
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,599
Slaps like we was at the poetry slam but I was sitting to myself thinking like

389
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
Am I going to extend this like when it got to be his turn

390
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,255
What's left for him to say I don't know what more what other words

391
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Back at you

392
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,143
And so it wasn't until the second person from this team got up and he started

393
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Speak and he was like

394
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
You know

395
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,287
Debating about to say this Brave this is a this is disrespect

396
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
Go to the state of debate and he turned to her it was a

397
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
This moment he turned to her

398
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
I he said it like from

399
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
So

400
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
You should go down the hall because

401
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
That's where portrait poses help visit academic

402
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Debate

403
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
What

404
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
And he basically his argument was that what we were doing was

405
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
We will we were having one

406
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Talent show

407
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
I was just like

408
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
I get it

409
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
I can maybe it was a study and I had done all night but everything kicked in that moment what happened came into the room

410
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
Like I get everything that she was trying to say what

411
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,879
She was saying about the structure of debate because I had felt those things before I just didn't know how to articulate them

412
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
What's it like I get

413
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Did I can

414
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
What's it like

415
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
Commissioner get what she saying like the bay

416
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
And let's just say we definitely went on to

417
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
You won this match

418
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Yeah we won the debate because

419
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
Let me just explain what happened in the

420
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Judges

421
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
In this kind of situation have a choice

422
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Price Rite

423
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
Like they can hear the arguments that Ryan and Marsha on arm

424
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
Making and they can think of

425
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Really about the piece

426
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Peace Corps or about armed services

427
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Is so

428
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
You lose

429
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Or they can do what the judge in the state

430
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
They can say all right

431
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
Topic has kind of ship

432
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
But let's look at what we haven't

433
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Let's look at the argument

434
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Ryan marshawna saying.

435
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
The structure of debate is

436
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Racist

437
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,943
And then you've got the other team not really responding in any kind of like

438
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
Counter argument attempt way

439
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,319
Ryan in this debate what does is he

440
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,439
Key points of thought he points it when this other team says leave the room and he says Hey like

441
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
What they just did

442
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Cruzar

443
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
That we are

444
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Excluded from

445
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
And the judge agreed

446
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,447
Oh so you use you use his sort of you use his you don't belong here as

447
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
A kind of

448
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,055
As a as an article about our evidence in

449
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
Came for a lot from what happen

450
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
In the debate

451
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Fascinating let me just take that guy site like so that you're changing the whole

452
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
Really gets going there's no racism hegemony like I'm a racist

453
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Going to be what is he supposed to do like

454
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
Wingstop

455
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
The first off

456
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,631
Diesel stop

457
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,983
I mean I mean you don't have to say you're right this ain't nobody going to want to admit that they're racist

458
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
But you can definitely

459
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,383
Admit that you've been gation races Praxis or you can have a debate about whether or not that was erased

460
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
There's a healthy debate to be

461
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
We had about that button

462
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
What he said was that you all do not belong here

463
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Leave the room

464
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,159
Like if you walk in and you say what you just said

465
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
And you say it forcibly in eloquent

466
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
I hate you're changing the rules here you're breaking things down to leave the room and then in the leave the room they'll even so

467
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Kohl's open to this counter

468
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Talk to you give

469
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Like it's still it's still

470
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
I just mean that you'd wear a vest and so this is a thing there

471
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Very few rules

472
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
To the Bay

473
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
But there is

474
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Kinds of norms

475
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
And depending on

476
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
You know

477
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Community of debate

478
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,295
The space of debate that you're in those Norms May differ

479
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,903
But I only know of a few rules like there must be a winner and a loser

480
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,511
Time limits with an obscene that be debatable at times

481
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
There must be

482
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
An affirmative and negative

483
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Other than that how one

484
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Approaches debate

485
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
You know how one approach

486
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
Just the topic how one approaches themselves in their house

487
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
Position all of that stuff is

488
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Debatable and arguably should be

489
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
What is it there's no like

490
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Bible

491
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,015
Of the of debate to there's no like

492
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Okay so they eat

493
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
Put out things like the NDT rulebooks like affirmative teams

494
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,951
Must be topical butt in the world of debate what does it mean to be

495
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
You know what does it mean to be on

496
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
That have to be debatable in order for the debate tonight

497
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
I'm just curious if you're really good at this I can you give me Parts me what you would have said if you were the guy

498
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Guy cumming

499
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
After you

500
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Before you

501
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:12,063
Well I'm one of the things that they needed to do in particular what's the phase of the debate itself shouldn't

502
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,647
P about the bait they were trying to say that but what they said was y'all shouldn't

503
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:21,792
I see that's interesting sick cuz cuz that's one of them up later I have sympathy for the other side is is

504
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
This weather like

505
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
I thought we talked about the Peace Corps

506
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
Like they walked into the wrong room

507
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,520
Or something but that was one of our argument was that how do you do debate how do you prepare

508
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
Just made them activity for hours and hours and hours

509
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
This week's opponent

510
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Couple weeks

511
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Arguably years are years and years

512
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
And not ever think about

513
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Why you debate the way that you

514
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
That was what we were press

515
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
So what was the other teams react

516
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
They were really upset

517
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Yeah they caught

518
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Really

519
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Yes

520
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
What do you mean no

521
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
Yes

522
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
That's

523
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
We'll be right back

524
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
Mrs. Miss Ms

534
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,616
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

535
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
And I'm here because I need your

536
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
And I request

537
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
For those of you who spent a lot of

538
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Timer kits

539
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
Parents aunts and uncles teachers

540
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,208
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

541
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Basically I want to hear about this

542
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
I kid you know did something

543
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
It just means you lean back and say

544
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Wow

545
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
How did they do

546
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Maybe it was the moment that I

547
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
Kids started reading back

548
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
To you

549
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

550
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
And you suddenly noticed they were doing

551
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music

552
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
In the margin of the geometry

553
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
We're interested in the

554
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Epic moments where

555
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
A kid does something

556
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Super smart

557
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

558
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
If you have a story

559

561
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Brilliance

562

Amber Court

563
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Short audio

564
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Again that's radiolab.org

565
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Flash brilliance

566
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Thank you so much

567
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
Hey I'm Jenna Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and it's back to our story again from producer Abigail keil

568
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Which is story about

569
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
A guy named Ryan wash and about

570
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Debate

571
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
How we debate

572
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Yeah so

573
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Just to kind of like

574
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,264
Pull back from that moment with Masha and the

575
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Katrina all that

576
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
This kind of thing wasn't just happening in a back

577
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Like it actually

578
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
Came from all kinds of different places all at once and one particular interesting person

579
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
He was influencing it was

580
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
George Soros

581
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
Soros Soros was fascinated by the bait that's Dr schnierow Reid Brinkley

582
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352
She's a scholar and a big figure in the so-called black tube

583
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Soros thought that debate was one of those kinds of activities that was incredibly

584
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Important to the production of democracy

585
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
So he started funding debate programs over

586
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,200
Four Seasons a place is like Eastern Europe and here in the US keyboard

587
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Pundmann

588
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Like millions and millions and millions of dollars

589
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
To start urban debate

590
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Program

591
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
First started with New York City 1997

592
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:09,120
Literally you know went out to all these New York high schools talk to a bunch of Administrators and Soros Justice

593
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Pump money into

594
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,728
New York City to start an urban debate league

595
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Baltimore and 2

596
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Chicago

597
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Detroit weather

598
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:22,432
City of Newark 23 or 24 City

599
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
So

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,832
You know if you take a step back and look at it all suddenly really within just a few years

601
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,904
You have all of these new black debaters

602
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
Would go through the exact same thing that Ryan went

603
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
At the regional level you can imagine get a bunch of African-American students a bunch of teachers who are supporting them in a very positive

604
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Environment they build relationship

605
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
In friendship and so debate Feels Like Home in the

606
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
That face. First National Tournament

607
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Culture shock

608
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
Because there is a c

609
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Of white

610
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
And according to dr. Reid Brinkley

611
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,808
Influx of black Debaters into a

612
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Primarily white space

613
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
Started to create some tension and pressure and

614
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,024
Not all built up and eventually resulted in something called the Louisville

615
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
Louisville project

616
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Started its goal was to increase

617
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:19,520
I mean for participation.

618
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,640
I know that there's a baseball bat associated with my

619
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Queso

620
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
Early 2000s

621
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
Down at the University of Louisville

622
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
There was a debate team or predominately african-american team

623
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,928
And so they were having a hard time finding

624
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Traction

625
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
He says they were going to be

626
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Tournaments

627
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
You know no matter what they did if they try to accommodate the more traditional style there was always something that they did wrong

628
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
The students would try to make argument

629
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
It's about race inside

630
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Topix

631
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
But usually it didn't work

632
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
And so

633
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
At a certain point but they decided that they were done with that they were like no we are unwilling

634
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,088
Going to play your game in the way that you have defined it should be

635
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:10,976
P-play Debaters what they would basically do is they would show up and they would force a conversation about race

636
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
Basically saying like we're not going to talk about China or global trade

637
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,168
Until we deal with this this is Louisville's famous pray they said

638
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
We can't change the state

639
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
But we can change

640
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
The state of debate

641
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,408
So they can you end up developing this whole new methodology which is actually a throwback

642
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
To Aristotle

643
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,736
And in his idea yeah you need

644
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Three things

645
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
Ethos pathos and logos

646
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,464
Books is like logic so you know getting research and

647
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
Scholars and evidence and things like

648
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
Pathos that's where emotion comes in so maybe a personal story or sharing something that will connect with.

649
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
And then eat those

650
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Switch

651
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,592
Pinned down you can think of it like as credibility or

652
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Is sort of like

653
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Speaking in tune with

654
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Like the spirit of your culture

655
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,064
That's where you get the introduction of the use of Hip Hop

656
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,720
Spoken word

657
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Appointment

658
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
The use of what we cost

659
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,400
Free college

660
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
What was the reaction when this first started

661
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
They would say things to Lewisville like you know this isn't

662
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Research this is me search

663
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Is it black Scholars

664
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
NoDa black dollars

665
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Airfield are not

666
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Rio LX

667
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,880
That's right they would say things like hip-hop does not belong

668
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,952
I'm here your argument style doesn't belong here

669
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Here in Dayton and I'm saying

670
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
Do things in really nice ways you know what I mean but there

671
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Could be really angry

672
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Matches at

673
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,240
Would you have an objection to a Prohibition as a coach

674
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
If you sit like look for the next

675
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Lit never

676
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
And leave

677
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
You are gender your sex

678
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,480
Your background your family your religion behind

679
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
And stay entirely in the brain

680
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,392
I doubt that you would do that but I'm wondering why you wouldn't I wouldn't think that's

681
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Black

682
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,304
Nothing is anti-black to everything BND gay and did you Auntie

683
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
It's right it's it's

684
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
It would be anti-black

685
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,776
And the reason why that's important for me is because these students don't get to leave their Blackness at

686
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
The door when they are

687
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
Write fake and pretend that they're not black

688
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
But that does not mean that everybody else is going

689
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Pretend that they are not black

690
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Even when they speak

691
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
What arguments they made when they open their mouth

692
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Make an argument

693
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
People are paying a

694
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Attention to the fact that it is

695
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Coming out of a black body

696
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
They don't get this

697
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Speak without race being a factor

698
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
Nobody gets too

699
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Without race

700
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,912
A factor in a nation where race is a factor

701
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,800
So he's 16 years old and he sees marshanda do the spoken word poetry

702
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
First read more about Louisville and he's just like

703
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
Die dedicated mother a career to discussing the bay every debate every every single one and every single

704
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Fast forward

705
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,232
He graduates high school isn't sure he's going to go to college I was first generation college student so I really didn't know much about the process

706
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
But then

707
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
Early August 2008

708
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,864
Get the message from a debate coach at a small school in Kansas

709
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Just called Emporia State University

710
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Ben

711
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
August 14th I was driving up to Emporia for

712
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Soap

713
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
Brian gets there get paired up with a sophomore LaToya Williams green

714
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,784
Start debating together and

715
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Over the course of a couple years

716
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
Brain starts to get recognized

717
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
He's winning speaker Awards he's

718
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
You know making it into the ground hit tournament

719
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
But

720
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
It was an uphill battle

721
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,376
She says the rain kept bumping into a judge's who

722
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
Weren't really into the whole three-tier approach

723
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
Yes I lost it

724
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
A lot of debate

725
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
It's before I want any

726
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,384
At this point he has graduated and he's debating with a freshman on the team

727
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
He's halfway into his senior year when

728
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
I had therefore

729
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
His new debate partner

730
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Fontana School

731
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,648
At this point it was either find somebody to the Bay with or I'm going to be career with over

732
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
And so what happened

733
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
Is Ryan is also close to one of my best friend's who's one of my contemporaries Rashad

734
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
Evans who was then a coach Chad West

735
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Connecticut University

736
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
And

737
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
Basically Rashad hat

738
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
What is bombshell idea

739
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
One day they called Ryan up and they were like

740
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
What if you partnered up with this guy from Rutgers

741
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Elijah Smith

742
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
And the reason particular which I thought this was

743
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,600
Does a good idea first Elijah is with an astoundingly good debater he just had excellent

744
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
The old and traditional

745
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
But the other reason was

746
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
That

747
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
Both Ryan and Elijah were queer black man

748
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:06,144
The thinking was that you got two guys kind of standing at the intersection of

749
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Tulak marginalized

750
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,080
And if they're going to try to make an argument about feeling excluded and invisible in the debate World well

751
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
They can own that argument

752
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Better than almost anyone

753
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
So

754
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
I called him

755
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,272
When I'd it was 9:30

756
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,856
Do you want to come to bed with me this is a lot

757
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,696
I can't really answer this right now and I was like I understand

758
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,560
I'm asking you to come move to Kansas for a semester or what have you and Lee in Newark

759
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Newark New Jersey

760
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:42,496
He called me back the next morning and it was like 8 a.m. my time he was like I've already applied

761
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,592
And so the next couple weeks he was down in Emporia

762
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,200
Elijah not debated for tournaments together first tournament matches

763
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Lost four

764
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,344
I was very upset I was heartbroken because I was a senior and I was like I don't really do to 4

765
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,744
But it's fine you know it's okay and dr. Reid Brinkley was actually at that tournament and she said that

766
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
Ryan and Elijah debate was a hot mess

767
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
They just didn't have any chemistry there was nothing

768
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
Persuasive about a nothing

769
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,240
Popped about it no I didn't really speak to the judges

770
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,848
She remembers a time when Ryan came over to her apartment to talk to her and

771
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,664
And he was just like you know I don't know what we're doing wrong

772
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,552
You know he hit you know he just didn't know why things weren't clicking what's not working I don't know what happen

773
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,392
The three of them were all talking and Rashad

774
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
Ryan really looks up to Rashad because

775
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Rashad is also a queer black guy but

776
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
He's also like a really really great debater and it was Rashad who said you're not being a

777
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
The queer black man

778
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Right you're being a debater

779
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,848
And so Richard would say things like you need to push it out you know what I mean you need to you know

780
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:56,736
Sometimes sometimes you need to duck walk on them you know I mean sometimes you're going to have to do you know if he's playing

781
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Be black you always be black and

782
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,368
We're in the spaces so rather than attempting to

783
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
High parts of yourself

784
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
Instead you should be fully you

785
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,792
Ryan with this and his head went back to Elijah

786
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
And within a few weeks

787
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
Things started to click who are just like here is what our roles are this is what you do

788
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:25,152
This is what I do I would start the debate

789
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
Expected rain in the choir if you will

790
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:46,656
Elijah who did the middle speech

791
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:53,056
Logic counter-arguments things like that he was better at the game of

792
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
Brian said they went from practicing ethos pathos logos to being it

793
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,856
Methodology

794
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
MN

795
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
In their second tournament they made it to the finals and they lost in a close decision but

796
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
The third tournament was actually a national tournament called Cita

797
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
Cross examination debate Association

798
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
It's kind of

799
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,616
Call Beth people's tournament

800
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
I was able to give her pretty good

801
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,456
2ar and we ended up squeaking little

802
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
And then there 4th tournament

803
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
Their final tournament together

804
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
But actually

805
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
That's the whole reason we're telling the story

806
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
NDT National debate tournament

807
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
That would be tournament

808
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
My decision not to go for the NDP is this marathon of a debate tournament

809
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
It's like you know March Madness or something if held every year it's last for

810
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
4 whole days and stairs

811
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
13 Rounds of debate

812
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
78

813
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
Fancy NDT is where

814
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
Harvard is

815
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
Northwestern

816
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
You know

817
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Work

818
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,768
Masa tournament that they prepare for

819
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
That's a turn in those sorts of teams usually win

820
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Weird

821
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Definitely the

822
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Definitely the

823
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
An all black team has never gotten past quarter finals

824
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
But this tournament

825
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
Things kick off Friday morning at 8 a.m.

826
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
Emporia versus

827
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Idaho

828
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
And it'd be Idaho

829
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
At 11:45 a.m.

830
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,368
I take care of Puget Sound 415 Sago against Oklahoma

831
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
Oklahoma actually beat their butts prelim so it sound like a rod rain

832
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
And the crazy thing is that after the loss to Oklahoma

833
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Ryan and Elijah

834
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Going to roll

835
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
USC

836
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,960
They were liver Emory they beat not one but two different teams from Harvard

837
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
City Michigan State

838
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,592
And then on the last day they beat another team from the University of Michigan

839
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
Then they going to Wake Forest that puts them in this Emmys which is never been done before by a black team and then they're going to

840
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
Oklahoma who they beat and that

841
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Put them into

842
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
The finals

843
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
It was

844
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,488
I can't everything's very surreal to me

845
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
We're in the finals of the NDT

846
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
Never happened before

847
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
We're also

848
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,288
Potentially about to unite the crowns and what that means is Wednesday than the NDT no team in history had ever done that

849
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
It and who were they up against

850
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
Well they were going against a team that Ryan had already faced

851
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Like twice that year

852
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,576
14 time National debate champions

853
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Northwestern University

854
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:52,512
So when is round get setup between Northwestern and Emporia

855
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,072
One of the things that we've described it as is

856
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
The Clash of civilizations

857
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,264
She says that about Northwestern because they have one of the biggest debate programs in the country

858
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
They've got an entire hive mind you know with a

859
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,688
Hotel war room for them to strategize in

860
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
And then

861
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
It was us this

862
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
To queer black guys

863
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
It's from Emporia Kansas

864
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
From a really small

865
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
School with not a lot of resources so it is like a David David

866
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Goliath

867
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,240
Okay so let me explain the room to you on this is the biggest Rim that I had ever debated in hotel room

868
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
Did they have the debate happening and is it

869
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
Huge Ballroom Ballroom

870
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,392
The audience of self a segregated on the right side of the room Northwestern side it was

871
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Packed full of beer

872
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
People and then on our side

873
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,024
Music like racially segregated to it was

874
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
It was it was

875
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,376
So just around this out

876
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,472
Up near the front of the room at a table where the judges which included our guys got here

877
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,032
And how many judges were judging the

878
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Debate

879
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
4 men 1 woman

880
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
All of them away

881
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,504
And they're on one side of the stage

882
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
On the other side of the stage are the

883
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
Northwestern student wearing Northwestern Jersey open I debated at Northwestern

884
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
For 4 years

885
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
His partner a young woman named

886
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,912
Peyton Lee I don't know if she knew what she was like

887
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
My partner paid I was a sophomore

888
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Where's my partner in

889
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Ryan worth

890
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,408
Stop the other side where seniors that was a thing that was really getting me it was going to be my last

891
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
Debate it was Peyton off last debate

892
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
It was my last night we were seniors

893
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
This was it

894
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,064
How to make the Pro Bowl

895
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
It's the NFL

896
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
It's it

897
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Their last

898
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Debate

899
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,280
Everybody kind of gets up before their speeches to say like thanks

900
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
And

901
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Bye

902
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Is Ryan

903
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
And

904
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
It might take me a little bit

905
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
This is Peyton

906
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Json goodbye

907
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Can we my friend

908
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
It's been my hardest work

909
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
My most rewarding play

910
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,184
And it's taught me more than I could ever dream

911
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Forgot

912
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,072
To all of you every part of this community

913
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
In particular

914
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
Special people in my life

915
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Wow

916
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
It was able to lie

917
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
So the topic for the year was whether or not the United States federal government should

918
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Increase incentives for certain forms of alternative energy sources nuclear power solar power wind or

919
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,136
Reduce restrictions on other forms of alternative energy

920
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Is coal natural gas and oil

921
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
Okay so Ryan and Elijah where affirmative

922
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
So they were supposed to argue like

923
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
Something positive about the how the US government should

924
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
Solar energy production or

925
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
Strict coal usage in energy or whatever

926
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
They're not going to debate

927
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
That we had

928
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
Figured out that we want to talk about the idea of

929
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
In other words

930
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
Energy isn't the most important conversation that we need

931
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Need to have

932
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,832
The conversation we need to have is whether this community

933
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Can include people like Ryan

934
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
Like Elijah can we find home in Dubai

935
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:38,560
That's how the community feels about itself that this is a home place for a lot of heat

936
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,216
Right there people who grew up in the bay people who started dating when they were 12 and 13 went all the way through college

937
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
To the people that you often developed

938
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
The tightest friendships with people that

939
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
You know how some of your coolest memory is cuz you all spent the summer together going to the Bay camp those people makeup

940
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,807
Your family there are people who make friends in debate when they're 13 that they

941
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Keep until they die

942
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,743
So rise up first and to make his argument about home

943
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
He starts talking about a movie

944
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
Have you all seen The Wiz

945
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
I have

946
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
I have not okay

947
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
So

948
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
All right real quick synopsis 19

949
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
78 film

950
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
And what

951
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,015
It is just like an all black cast version of The Wizard of Oz so like Michael Jackson

952
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
The Scarecrow Richard

953
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
Pryor as the Wiz

954
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
And Diana Ross

955
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
It was that movie was just like

956
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,327
To me you know it was the fear that Dorothy felt that the beginning of arrival

957
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
Going to Oz

958
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
An appointment is making is that like that's how he felt to

959
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,895
When he came into the babe when he was walking into that cafeteria

960
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,199
And there's a line where you say

961
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:07,647
When the Dorothy's of this world think of energy they don't think of thorium reactors but the energy required to get out of bed and navigate

962
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
The struggle

963
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Yeah so that's like kind of

964
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
How is that how you were like tying it

965
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,839
Energy for US Mint what it meant to get out of bed in the morning

966
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,911
What it meant to thrive in the world and what you were never meant

967
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Survive

968
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
And for Dorothy was able to reach a place of

969
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,431
Is there a way for me to get home where you realize that all you ever needed in the first place was yourself

970
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Home

971
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Sidemen

972
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
And that you have

973
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
The power all along

974
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,111
And that's part of what our argument was and I was part of what I was

975
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Trying to say was that I had been in debate

976
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
For eight years that that

977
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,815
And I was so sick and tired of people telling me that what I had to say about the bathing what I thought of

978
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
About the bait wasn't legit

979
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
When the bank was a

980
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Student driven activity

981
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:56,799
That I have just as much to say about this topic as you do and your claims are not any more valid than mine and my person

982
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,639
Bryan ended his like eight and a half minute speech

983
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,711
Insertive dislike hopeful appeal you know

984
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
Never give up you know we have to Ease on Down the Road

985
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
All together

986
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Dorothy just

987
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
The fattest guy in the Bronx

988
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Today at 1:35

989
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Blackhawk

990
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
And then after a few minutes

991
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,967
Argent the sophomore from Northwestern I got up and I gave the first

992
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:42,367
Negative speech

993
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Documents the one that they had beat us with every time called topicality which basically says the topic has

994
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
Posited a question

995
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
Should the US government alter its

996
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Approach to energy policy

997
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:59,519
And we think that the affirmative should have to answer that

998
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,639
First of all I don't think the resolution is a question second of all like know where the roles has it's a

999
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
That you have to be topical butt

1000
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
Our position was debate should be theoretically Fair both sides should be able to win

1001
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Argue that racism is bad

1002
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Ebates

1003
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
Like we can't argue against that I'm not going to say Debaters in the home for me I love it

1004
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,423
Who is the baker for now who's debate inclusive

1005
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,823
For now is it actually fair if an order to win a debate you need to have like a whole research team and debate

1006
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Great camps that cost thousands of dollars to put

1007
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,783
Participate in a topic that's democratically voted upon by all the schools of the beginning

1008
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,623
Something about the topic should be mentioned just to give the negative

1009
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
Basically

1010
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
SPAC

1011
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
Respect for the

1012
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,143
Thousands of hours that my partner and I in the Northwestern debate team and other people in debate

1013
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,471
I've spent researching energy and being prepared to talk about

1014
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,287
The intricacies of energy policy in the United States

1015
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
This went on for over an hour

1016
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
It was it was a lot

1017
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,735
Eventually Arjun and Peyton are like Focus their argument on

1018
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
Their version of

1019
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
The traditional version

1020
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
This is how you actually changed

1021
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
Not by focusing on yourself but doing research is being able to argue the affirmative side of something and

1022
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
The negative side of it because people who learn those kinds of skills

1023
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
They can actually go and do things

1024
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Outside of the

1025
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
Like dealing convoluted globalize training

1026
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,007
Spell global warming

1027
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
So after

1028
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
2 hours of this it's almost midnight

1029
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Feels

1030
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Exhausted

1031
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Yeah

1032
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,039
But I felt it in the room that people were like we're not out of the debate

1033
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
You can still win

1034
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
At this point there's only one species left

1035
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
And it's Ryan

1036
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
I was nervous I knew it was my last speech I knew everybody in the audience was waiting on me but I like I just felt pressure

1037
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
And I had maybe

1038
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,679
Five sentences written on a piece of Yunnan

1039
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
Copy paper

1040
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Like whoa

1041
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
That's all I got

1042
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,431
The audio quality of the speech is kind of terrible but

1043
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
We're just going to let it play

1044
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,351
Really answer this argument

1045
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
And change our relationship to the world

1046
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,887
Ryan says early on that piece of paper he was holding through it

1047
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Start speaking for my phone

1048
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Where what I will call the Sean.

1049
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,359
Shantae the Sunday at the place that encapsulates your soul

1050
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
In your loins

1051
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
Well alright

1052
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
Wendy Williams

1053
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:56,063
Diana Ross and Michael Jackson

1054
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,223
Especially when they don't have another place to go

1055
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:04,159
There was portions of the speech that I don't remember giving

1056
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,511
I was just like oh apparently I said there was a part where I must have

1057
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Shirt off

1058
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,095
Shirt off

1059
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,887
Like I don't remember that

1060
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Can I have

1061
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,287
Pause cuz what I was I was trying to just get out of that so I mean come back

1062
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
It's a kind of life provide a voice of

1063
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
But as I kind of slow down to do that but

1064
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
50 seconds left

1065
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,255
I still have to answer this last thing I still have to extend a piece of evidence ocean I didn't say anything about warming

1066
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:46,399
What do I do what do I do what do I do if I just look like this is reason enough to vote affirmative

1067
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Forget it

1068
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,639
MN

1069
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,199
I walked over and shook their hands

1070
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
I gave Elijah a hug and then I walked

1071
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Got the room and went into

1072
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,231
At that point is a judge I took a deep breath

1073
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,303
I packed up my notes

1074
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,703
I put headphones noise-canceling headphones on my head I found a room where there was no one else

1075
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,495
Surrounded I could have total quiet

1076
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,799
Think about what had been said

1077
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
Scott says that he felt like the debates

1078
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
What's close

1079
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
Is going to be a tightrope so

1080
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
I sit down and look at my notes

1081
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
Irie listen to the last couple speeches that I had

1082
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,575
Recorded several times

1083
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Wenwen Han Northwestern

1084
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
Presented a lot of good research

1085
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
And a lot of it he agreed with

1086
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
On the other hand like

1087
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
Eleanor Jenner saying if you have these

1088
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,631
Skills and you're going to be better prepared to go tok

1089
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
In front of

1090
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
Congress or something

1091
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:58,591
But Scott says if you just listen to like Ryan and Elijah like they sound more persuasive

1092
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,455
Like you can't convince me that somebody who sounds like that isn't actually also prepared to do those

1093
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
And Toad like

1094
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
Ryan Elijah School presentation

1095
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,599
Is actually proof that Peyton and Argent argument

1096
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
Is invalid

1097
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,207
Are the same time he thought

1098
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,303
There have to be things that we all

1099
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,607
Just agree on as our starting point

1100
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,007
And if the alternative is a world in which the affirmative can come into a debate and talk about anything they want to talk about

1101
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,871
Then the ability to make that a fair competitive environment seems a little problematic

1102
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
I think Scott

1103
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,295
Was kind of torn took me about 45 minutes to an hour to decide

1104
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
Do I thought won the debate

1105
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,951
Ryan says that when he was sitting there waiting for them

1106
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Decision to be announced

1107
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
That we lost

1108
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,351
And eventually decision

1109
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,959
Three judges voted for Emporia into for Northwestern

1110
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Emporia

1111
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
My partner Elijah jumped out

1112
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
If you could have seen this room

1113
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,439
Erupt into Joy I was in tears

1114
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
Watching this historic moment happened because I've been around for so long and I've watched so many black Debaters failed

1115
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
How to make it to

1116
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
That pop point

1117
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
I stood there and I was like oh my God

1118
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,359
All I can say I said it like a million I was like oh my God

1119
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,015
What sweets got in the end

1120
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:47,391
He actually published like 11 page essay all about you know his decision explaining why he voted the way he did

1121
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
There's a lot in there but

1122
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
What are you trying to take away from it is bad

1123
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
In a while

1124
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,327
Well maybe he didn't like that

1125
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
There was a

1126
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,143
So disregard for the topic

1127
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
He would have liked it a whole lot less

1128
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239
If Ryan and Elijah hadn't been in the room

1129
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
I mean

1130
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:09,151
Debate is itself is incredibly important to me debate has been the greatest

1131
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
Influence

1132
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
In shaping who I am as a person

1133
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
And so in many ways I view

1134
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,647
Debate as my home

1135
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
And given that

1136
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
It was a debate

1137
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
The challenged and criticized

1138
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,071
The activity that I have made a home for the last 4 years that pointed out

1139
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Weaknesses

1140
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
It caused me to

1141
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Reflect

1142
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
When's the regiment really work

1143
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
I find this

1144
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
China hike

1145
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
It's a it's either

1146
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,967
A segregating or an integrating event my Gavotte Mike sentence that is kind of integrate interracially

1147
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,991
Chile World

1148
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,551
This is a strangely warm spot

1149
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Are you saying no

1150
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
When we ask Brian about how he felt about winning this tournament I I expected him to be really like

1151
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
Like celebratory and

1152
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,191
You know tell me that it changed his life

1153
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
He was the first black

1154
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
Student to win this tournament and

1155
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
You know it seemed important

1156
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
But

1157
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
She didn't really go there

1158
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
No

1159
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Don't seem like

1160
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:21,087
I'm proud of I want you to seeing you know like why why don't you

1161
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
It wasn't good

1162
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
Thing for history

1163
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
It was a good thing

1164
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
To motivate people

1165
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
I just

1166
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
I just want to say

1167
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
It was an important when it was significant it was powerful it was beautiful

1168
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,567
But it was very clear to us very early on did not much head

1169
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
Change by the time

1170
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
We got in

1171
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
Chenier Brinkley says that since Ryan's win

1172
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
There's been like a backlash

1173
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,063
Basically I'm in the next year or another black

1174
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
Broke through with two black women this time and not cost

1175
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
Controversy in

1176
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
The state of debate

1177
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
It was ruined

1178
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
The same here you even had a group of

1179
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
Schools like talking about breaking off

1180
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
To form their own tournament where

1181
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Performance Styles wouldn't

1182
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Really be

1183
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Invited

1184
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
I adding all of this just

1185
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Mix Ryan like

1186
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,567
Not really know how to feel about

1187
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
His will like

1188
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Maybe sometimes

1189
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
It can just

1190
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
Feel like

1191
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Yeah

1192
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
It's sort of season

1193
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,879
The series of accident

1194
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
You're in

1195
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,951
Cool were accidentally rub

1196
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Who pushes you

1197
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Pretty much

1198
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Horses you

1199
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
Into something which

1200
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Suddenly

1201
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,375
Takes you over

1202
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
You turn out to be

1203
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,703
Peculiarly good at almost Again by axe

1204
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,031
Then you're thrown into the sequence of events where you get

1205
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079
Get to meet Elijah and then almost by a

1206
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,639
Accident you become a champion and then suddenly it's over

1207
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
The whole thing

1208
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Feels

1209
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
Strangely

1210
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
Lonely

1211
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,831
Lonely but beautiful wonder how it feels to

1212
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879

1213
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
That is the first time you have agreed with Robert
