00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey Radiolab it's Molly Webster

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,680
Before you start the episode I have a question for you

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,264
Somewhat impolite probably wouldn't ask you this in person question

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
And that question is

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Are you trying

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
To have a kid

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Because if you are

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
I want to hear from you

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
So if you are trying

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,040
And you be interested in talking to us totally confidentially

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,088
You can email us at

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Trying

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
At radiolab.org

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
And will tell you more

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
That's trying at radiolab.org

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Thanks

17
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
Are you awake

18
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,984
Start listening to Radiolab

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,104
Radiolab WNYC

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,904
Testing one two this the headphones safe

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
Robert

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,768
Radiolab

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
How could I say

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,632
Because I let you go so give me another 20 minutes do I get to talk

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Is there a little while back I had a rather live a little less conversation with these two guys first of all like who are you

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
I'm Larry Bell and I'm Avenue Bell

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
So you are related in your both in the plumbing business

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
Are we related

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,528
Yes we are related but we are in the home inspection business

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
Yeah they're father and son at the family business we are the

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
Principles

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Of accurate building inspectors

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:38,816
Brooklyn New York and I've been in the construction in to see evidence I'm about 16 years old I'm 84

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
Okay I'm not giving my age

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
I wanted to talk to them because

36
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,312
As building inspectors date there's something they see over and over and over all the time

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
That is actually a clue

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
In what turns out to be

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Deep mystery

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
The way that you just what exactly

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
Well let us say you have a yard in front of your house

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
You're just back your

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,792
Doesn't make in front and right in the middle of the yard is a tree and the tree happens to be

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Weeping willow just for example and not too far away from this tree underground there is a water pipe perfectly

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
Good pipe connecting your house to the main city water line that's in the middle of the street the roots of this tree of course

46
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Can go anyway they want to go then go north south east west whatever

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
What do you Bells have noticed that even if a tree is

48
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Hand

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
420 30 yards away from the water pipe

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
For some reason the tree roots creep

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
With uncanny regularity straight toward

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
The water pipe the tree will wrap its roots around that pipe around around around

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,496
Doing of spaghetti like almost and each one of those lines of spaghetti

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Squeezing

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Little bit each one announce announce announce announce announce and eventually over a p

56
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
People crack the pipe

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Like a nutcracker

58
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
You don't see this happening all the time coming up through the pipe into the house

59
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
It's amazing that you happen to be the magnolia tree outside of our house got into the sewer pipes

60
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
Reached its tentacles into our house

61
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:25,824
What's the sewage pipe you just happens to a lot of people it's almost as if these plants it's almost as if they know

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
Where are pipes

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
I see what's happening

64
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
Are you bringing the plant parade again is that what is that what this is crush on you because

65
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
The Roots under the ground all connected into a whole Hive you have problems with

66
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Everytime I close my eyes you're coming out of whatever Direction I do I do at the plant parade in a plant biologist

67
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
I prayed she's done three experiments

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
I think I tell you about what she has done you even you

69
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,664
Will be provoked into thinking the plants can do stuff you didn't imagine dream they could

70
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
I know I know you I know you

71
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Let's go to the first this is the

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Plant and pipe Miss

73
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
Hello hello hello you might

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
Think that the plant sends out roots in every direction one of the richest

75
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,167
Happens to bump into a water pipe and says to send a signal to come over here

76
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Is the water

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
But that scientist I mentioned my name is Monica research associate professor

78
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
The University of Sydney out of the garden

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Into her lap

80
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
Yeah tasted in my life

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,135
That restricted the route so they can only go to one of just two directions

82
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Order water pipe

83
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Or away from the water pipe

84
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,839
What kind of pot is it kind of shaped like the letter Y but upside down

85
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Or the to the right

86
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,983
Got the plants if they were truly dumb they goes if you hit a real friend

87
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
But after 5 days

88
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,127
She found that 80% of the time the plants went well maybe chose

89
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
To head toward the dry pipe that has water in it so the question is

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
Appliance that is quite far away from the actual pipe

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,391
How does it know which way to turn and grow its roots

92
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
So that he can find a warsat

93
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,279
My hypothesis is that what happens in

94
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,119
Where can I can I have a few minutes you got somewhere to go

95
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
You got somewhere to go

96
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
No good

97
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
If she's going to do this experiment

98
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
Most likely she's going to use cold water

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
She's not going to use hot water

100
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Cuz you don't want

101
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Cook your plants

102
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
You know

103
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
And it's more expensive why waste hot water

104
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
How do I establish is it a fact that you're okay but you want to confess

105
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
That

106
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
The cold water pipe

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Causes

108
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Even

109
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Small amount of water to condense

110
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
On the pipe itself

111
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,703
On the outside but I kind of like a cold glass sitting on your desk

112
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
And it's always a puddle at the bottom of the glass is not broken it's not a leaking water still in there so there is

113
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
Some water outside of the pipe is condensation

114
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Right you what they're saying even if you totally seal the pipe so there's no leak

115
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
The difference in temperature will create some condensation on the outside

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,767
Little bit of moisture that the plant was somehow sense if you look at a root under a microscope

117
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
What you see is

118
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
Movie Fountains of feelers like hairs on your head

119
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
Looking for water every one of them

120
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,079
And all of a sudden one of them I found them and then all the other one direction

121
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
Be sensitive hands he argues would probably be able to

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Keelback tiny different yes

123
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
But Monica says absolutely not

124
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
I purposely removed

125
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
The chance for most degrading

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
She made sure that the dirt

127
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Didn't get wet

128
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
Because she actually fast in the water pipe

129
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
Do the outside of the Potter wasn't touching the dirt at always so the

130
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
This branching pot thing

131
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,775
The part where the water pipe was over the pipe is on the outside of the pots right outside

132
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
And the plants still went

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
To the place where the pipe

134
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
Was not even in the dark

135
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Estranged

136
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Let me get the vibration of the pie

137
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
That's making it go toward it they would have to have no you got some kind of signal different

138
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Traveling through the soil

139
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
Monica thought about that and designed a different experiment

140
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,935
Again if you mentioned it depart my experiment to post with the fort

141
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Very different options for our plant

142
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
On one side

143
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
Instead of a pipe with water she attaches

144
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,919
An MP3 player with a little speaker playing the recording

145
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Sound of water

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
And then on the other side Monica has another

147
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
MP3 player with speaker but this one

148
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Plays

149
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Nothing

150
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
So she's got her plants in the pot and we're going to now wait to see what happens remember that the roots of these

151
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
These plants can either go

152
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,471
One Direction towards the sound of water in the pipe

153
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Or

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
The other direction to the sound of

155
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,151
On the fifth day they take a look and discover most

156
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Other routes of majority lyrics were hitting

157
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Chord the sound of water

158
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Exactly

159
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Exactly

160
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
So they just went right for the

161
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
MP3

162
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,535
Fake water not even the actual water just the sound of it just the sound

163
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Stetson

164
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
I want to plant

165
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Ears

166
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Something

167
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Like they don't have ears

168
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Or a brain or anything like

169
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
They couldn't hear like we hear

170
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Well

171
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Baby

172
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
They definitely don't have a brain

173
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
No questionnaire

174
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
But

175
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
They do have root hairs

176
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
This is Jennifer Frazier vlogger of The Artful amoeba at Scientific American

177
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Possibility that plants can

178
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Do something like here so

179
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
What do we have in our ears

180
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
That we use

181
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
To hear sound

182
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Right

183
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
And if you go to too many rock concerts you can break

184
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Keith Harris and that leads to permanent hearing loss

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Too bad

186
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
So maybe

187
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Root hairs which are always down

188
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Right at the growing tips

189
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
A plant root

190
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Maybe plant roots

191
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
AR

192
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Like little ears Maybe

193
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
Which route is is like a little year for the plant I don't know

194
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
That is cool

195
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
That is definitely cool

196
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Okay good thing I don't get is is in any animals the hairs inner ear are sending the signals to a boy

197
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
Brain and that is what chooses what to do that's true

198
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
If a plant doesn't have a brain what is

199
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,127
Choosing where to go think Monica knows the answer to that

200
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
But she does believe

201
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,247
Let me know that we humans a little obsessed

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Weed the brain

203
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
And so we

204
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,415
Oranda decompression oil I would say the conviction

205
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
That the brain is the center of the universe

206
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
And and if you have a brain and nervous system yuan

207
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Good and you can do amazing stuff

208
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
And if you don't run by default you can do much

209
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
General okay it's a very biased

210
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
View

211
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Humans have in particular

212
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Two words others

213
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
But still I mean

214
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
To say that a plant

215
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Choosing a Direction

216
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
I don't know I mean it

217
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
La quina planta

218
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
It bends toward sunlight we've all seen houseplants

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Would you say that the plant is

220
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
Seeing the sun now I mean it's just it's it's

221
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
Reacting to things and there's a series of mechanical

222
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
Behaviors inside the plant that are just

223
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
Bending in the direction to meet couldn't it just be like that

224
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,615
Fair and I think if I move on to the next experiment from Monica

225
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
You're going to find it a little bit

226
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Harder to objective we need to take a break first but when we come back the parade that I want you to join will come and see

227
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Swoop you up

228
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
The carry you along in

229
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Floating Visio

230
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559

More information about Sloane @www

238
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Sloan.

239
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,039
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

240
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
And I'm here because I need your help

241
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
And I request

242
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

243
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,863
Aunts and uncles teachers about what we're calling

244
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Tiny moments of brilliance

245
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,263
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

246
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
It just means you bring back and say whoa

247
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Maybe it was the moment that I

248
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

249
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
To you

250
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Or maybe the kid was a piano

251
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,903
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

252
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,767
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

253
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
We're interested in the

254
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Epic moments where

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
A kid does something super smart

256
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
It doesn't have anything to do with it

257
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
If you have a story

258
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
T-shirt with us

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
Go to radiolab.org

260
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Flash brilliance

261
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Record short audio message

262
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
And that's radiolab.org

Splash brilliant

264
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Thank you so much

265
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,959
321 Chad Robert Radiolab so today we have a triptych of experiments about plants that apparently

266
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Jury still out

267
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,639
Are going to make me rethink my stance on Plants experiment to now

268
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Are we now that is correct

269
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
So

270
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
We are going to meet

271
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
A beautiful little plant called a mimosa pudica with a perfectly symmetrical plant with

272
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,463
With leaves on either side of a central stem

273
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Eggplant I get so many signs

274
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Centuries

275
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Because

276
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
Peculiar plant has a surprising little

277
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
A reflex

278
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
An anti

279
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Predator reaction

280
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,383
Like a defensive mechanism as soon as it senses that are grazing animal is nearby

281
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,991
If a nosey deer happens to bump into it the mimosa plant

282
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Sleeves

283
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Curls all its leaves up against its stem

284
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,903
The whole thing immediately closes up and makes it look like

285
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
There's no plans here

286
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Justin

287
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Boring set of twigs

288
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Nothing delicious

289
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
At all

290
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
So do you like a Nobel

291
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Nevermind

292
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Right

293
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
And you can actually see this happen so

294
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
So

295
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Mimosa pudica

296
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
Can get anybody can get one of these pants on and we did

297
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
And if you just

298
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,991
Patrick even just one leaf that

299
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
You can actually watch this Kaskade

300
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
Believe closing

301
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Yeah sort of

302
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Startling to see

303
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
ETSU UT

304
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
So that voice belongs to a Tish Bachelorette who is with Princeton University's Council on science and technology

305
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,847
We should one of these plans to him and a couple of his colleague Sharon Dela Cruz

306
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
And Peter landegren

307
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Because he wanted them to help us

308
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Recreate Monica's neck

309
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Experiment

310
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Okay

311
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
Could you just described it just briefly just what you did

312
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
Well I created these

313
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Horrible

314
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
Contraption apparently she built some sort of apparatus

315
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
I guess you could call it a

316
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Mimosa plant

317
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Dropbox

318
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
Picture one of those parachute drops if they have it there

319
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,407
State fairs or amusement parks where your who stood up to the top except in this case

320
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Instead of a chair

321
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
They got a little

322
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Plant size box

323
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Into which she put these sensitive plants

324
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Monica

325
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Drop them

326
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Just about you

327
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Seven or eight in London very comfortably

328
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
Padded face made of foam

329
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
So no plans with actually hurt

330
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Cindy's experiment

331
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,079
But the drop was just shocking and sudden enough for the little plant do

332
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Close all

333
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Leaves

334
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
What's reflex defense

335
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,503
Ben Monica oyster plant back up again and dumps it again

336
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
And again

337
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Allegan

338
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
And after not all who want to drop

339
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
The plant

340
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
She noticed

341
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Stop

342
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Closing its leaves

343
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,079
So after the first few the plants already realized that that was not necessary

344
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
The plants

345
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
The plant stop

346
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
What is it.

347
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Hope they stop folding up

348
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,087
She thinks that they somehow remembered all those drops and it never hurt so they didn't pull up anymore they've learned some

349
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Exactly which is pretty amazing

350
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
You couldn't just be at

351
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
An entirely different interpretation here

352
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Like what the plants

353
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Have to keep pulling the leaves up and they just

354
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Retired

355
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,167
They run out of energy exactly it's a costly process for

356
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
But

357
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Figured out they weren't

358
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Because after dropping them 60 times

359
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
She then

360
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Left right

361
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
It would close up so

362
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,527
It's not that it couldn't. It's just during the dropping it learned

363
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Let it didn't need to

364
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Yeah

365
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
That's a

366
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
Learning is something I didn't think plants could do

367
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
They do

368
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Hi-Tech

369
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
So we pick him up if it's this easy and this matter of fact we should be able to do this ourselves and see it for ourselves

370
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
So

371
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,871
That's really split the scientist from Princeton come in theaters Sheridan

372
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
They design from scratch

373
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
Parachute drop in

374
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,087
Blue translucent Lego pieces

375
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Plant rapper and we can move it up

376
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
And we can drop it

377
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
Don't we just wrapped in our mimosa plant little she felt for him

378
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
Down and then

379
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Account

380
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
And then we Let It Rock

381
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
5

382
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
3

383
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
2

384
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
1

385
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Dropped

386
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Five four

387
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
3 and we dropped it once and twice

388
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Again

389
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
And again

390
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
We waiting for the

391
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
Restraint

392
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Stop both we drop

393
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
We drop

394
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
You didn't happen

395
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
It was curling every time when it every time it just kept curly and curly

396
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
So you can replicate what you saw it happened so we went back to my life as you know built

397
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Your elevator

398
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,663
We did what happened to you didn't happen to a. Can you can you imagine what

399
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
We did wrong

400
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
Example my plants role in environment control room switch

401
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,647
Is Not A Minor Details then the no experience in extra changes oil

402
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
For example I don't know if that was the case for your plan

403
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
No I doubt I'll be kept switching room cuz we weren't sure whether you wanted to be in the Highlight or week later

404
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
One light or no light it was my baby too much

405
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
The Wizard of Oz

406
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
The movie the plants correctly responded by not opening

407
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,503
Because something really mad what's happening around it and it's like

408
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
This place is not safe

409
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
Atlantic on this point

410
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
She's got a

411
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
CiCi's right one time the plant literally flew out of the pot and upended with r

412
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
Roots Exposed on humanitarian

413
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,519
The be kind of proved our point we were so inconsistent so clumsy that the plants were smart

414
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
To keep playing it safe

415
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Can closing themselves up

416
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
That's a very successful your experiments you found exactly what the plans would do under your shirt

417
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Circumstances

418
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Cardinal saib more

419
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Tumultuous the mine

420
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
And she goes on to argue that we've been a little bit more steady and little bit more consistent

421
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
The plants would have

422
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
And would have remembered the last

423
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Because what she does next 3 days later she takes these plants back into the lab

424
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Just to see like

425
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
The difference between the first time you learned something in the next time they figured out faster this time or maybe

426
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Slower

427
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
So she takes a plan

428
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
She puts them into the parachute

429
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
She drops

430
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
And she says this time they relaxed almost immediate

431
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
They'd remember straight away straight away

432
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
All of them

433
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
No ready what to do

434
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:21,375
They remember what it happened three days before the dropping dinner that they didn't have to fold up

435
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
So they didn't

436
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,983
And then she waited a few more days I came back they still remember

437
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Yeah

438
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Few more days

439
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
Yeah and it was almost like

440
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,479
Eventually she came back after

441
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
Unidays 28 days

442
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Yes and they still remain

443
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,647
Are they still did not close when she dropping that's what she says

444
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,767
What was your reaction when you saw this happen that's pretty sure

445
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Retention of

446
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,607
Of knowledge my reaction was

447
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
That was my reaction

448
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
Because the only reason why this perriman

449
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,335
Turn out to be 28 days it's because I ran out of time

450
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
So did they might remember even

451
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
How much longer time than 28 days

452
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
So she saying they remembered for almost a month

453
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,672
Can you remember what you were doing now I actually like even this morning I'm at that's already gone

454
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Supposing that she's right

455
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,048
Where would the aloe plant even store a memory

456
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,400
That's what I asked her I do want to go back there too

457
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Support for something like learning

458
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
Like I don't understand

459
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,640
Learning as far as I understand it is something that involves memory and

460
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,992
Storage but I do that in my brain that's the place where I can remember thing

461
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
In my brain

462
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Yes I do is a bro I think

463
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,696
Is your daughter came to my house

464
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Picasso and I forgot now

465
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Sorry

466
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Actually Monica's dog leaves

467
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Perfectly into her third experiment which

468
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,696
Again will be with a plant but it was originally done with with

469
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
IDOC so Pavlov

470
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Started by getting some dogs

471
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,888
And some meat Annabelle

472
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
The kind of the standard

473
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
And his idea was to see if he could

474
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Condition needs

475
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
To associate

476
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
That food would be coming

477
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
From sound of a bell

478
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
So he brought them some meat

479
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
And then eat the meat then

480
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,064
He would bring them to meet and he would ring a bell

481
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
And again drooling eating

482
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
And he would repeat this

483
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Ring

484
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Meet

485
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Eat

486
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Ring

487
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
Meat eater

488
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Ring meat

489
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Finally

490
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
One time

491
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
He did not bring the meat but he rang the bell

492
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
Turn off the dogs begin to droop they had learned to associate the sound of the Bell Witch

493
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,872
Nothing to do with me when they actually saw and smelled and 8B

494
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Exactly

495
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
Animals do this experiment but

496
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
It got Monica thank you

497
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Buddha plant

498
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,880
The same plant learn to associate something totally random like a bell

499
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
With something

500
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
It wanted like food

501
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
Are you like aggressively looking around for like you wake up in the mornings and now what can I get a plan to do that rhyme

502
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,912
Reminds me of my dog reminds me of a bear

503
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Reminds me of Abby

504
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,752
No really

505
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
Lucifer I feel I feel this is the kind of good

506
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Society

507
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
I don't do that

508
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:49,504
But Monica says what she does do is move around the world with a general feeling of

509
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
What if

510
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
So she decided to conduct lyrics

511
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
Pretty much like at the concept of Pablo with

512
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,328
He's dog applied but instead of dogs she had pea plants in the dark

513
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,912
And for the meat substitutes you gave each planned

514
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,984
Little bit of food in this case of little blue

515
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
LED light

516
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
Light is obviously representing dinner if you if you shine light on the plant you're like feeding it

517
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,456
Real I'd like to know that

518
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
I need light to grow so

519
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Otherwise account

520
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
So for three days three times a day she would Chinese little blue lights

521
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
The plants

522
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
From upper to

523
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Particular direction

524
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
And she noticed that unsurprisingly the plants would always grow towards the light

525
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Endo knows that the salivation equivalent was

526
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
The tilt of the plant except

527
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
And then I needed

528
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
The difficult

529
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
August of this payment was

530
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
To find something

531
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Being that will be

532
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Quite irrelevant

533
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
And really meant

534
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Nothing

535
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
To the plant

536
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
To start with

537
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Liza Bell for the dog

538
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
So after much trial and error with

539
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
Clicks and hums and buzzes

540
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Randomness

541
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
That the one stimulus that would be

542
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
The perfect was

543
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
A fan

544
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
A little fan the same one that are used in

545
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Computers light

546
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Yunnan very tiny

547
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
She determined that you can pick a little computer finkelman

548
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
But we're going to keep them for pretty much ever

549
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Utterly indifferent to the whole

550
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
The plants don't replace the fan right next

551
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
So that

552
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Coming from the

553
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Same Direct

554
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
These two stimuli she put the plants

555
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Little pea plant

556
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
What's 2 a kind of training

557
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Little fan goes on

558
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
Light goes on of aiming at the people from the same direction and the people and leans toward

559
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,704
Then she takes a little light and the little fan and move them to the other side of the plant turns the fan on

560
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
Betway

561
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
Light after Fender moved around always matched in the same way

562
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Together fan by Clean

563
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
Fanfight Lee fan lightning

564
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:03,136
Same as the type of the beldam eating the television

565
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
The doggo you do not play the stand for

566
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
For the plant

567
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,768
We know now for the dogs the dogs

568
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
He's expecting

569
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
Predicting something to arrive

570
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
If it was only the fan

571
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,544
Would the plant anticipate the light and lean toward it

572
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Be going random

573
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,896
After three days of this training regime it is now time

574
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
The plants with

575
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Justify

576
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
No light

577
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
Chuck Monica moves the fans

578
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
The new place where

579
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
On

580
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
And the pea plants are left alone

581
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Quiet

582
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Darkroom

583
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Feeling the breeze

584
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
And then

585
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,400
The next day

586
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
Are the uni on a Sunday afternoon goes into that

587
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
Darken room with all the people at

588
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
So you know I mean the dark she's got a little red headlamp

589
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Yeah she moves about the room

590
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Tearing down

591
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Plants under the red glow over head lamp

592
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
And then I

593
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Stop

594
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
The these little plants

595
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
My Little Pony

596
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Indeed

597
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Turn and move

598
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
Toward the fans catching up their little leaves as if they were sure that if any moment now light would arrive

599
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,032
A scooter was Sunday and I remember it was Sunday because I study

600
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Discriminant

601
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Stop my plants

602
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
There's no one here on Sunday afternoon

603
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
How can spin my head off your phone

604
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,040
Oh my God

605
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
These guys are at

606
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,880
She doing it so course that was the only the beginning then

607
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:44,000
We actually had to run four months of Trials to make sure that you know that what we were seeing

608
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,840
Was not one p doing out two piece but it was actually a majority

609
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
So you just

610
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
Did what problems did to a plant you got the

611
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Plant tours

612
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Associated

613
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Fan with food

614
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Yeah

615
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
But once again I kind of wondered

616
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,832
Since the plant doesn't have a brain or even neurons

617
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:14,208
To connect the idea of light and wind or whatever that weird would they put that information

618
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
How can a plant

619
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
How do you do that

620
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
I don't know

621
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
I don't know yet

622
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,192
But what I do know is that defensive line doesn't have a brain descendants

623
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Doesn't

624
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
A priori

625
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Today's date

626
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
The plants can do something

627
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Dependent humans do it enough

628
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,992
It doesn't mean that everyone needs to do it in that way to be able to do it in the first

629
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,808
Multiple ways of doing one thing

630
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
So we're really like this is

631
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
We're really at the very beginning of this

632
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah I know

633
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
This weather is often more questions than answers

634
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
This part of the

635
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Define as well

636
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
Monica's work is actually gotten quite a bit of attention

637
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
The mother plant

638
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,408
Yes and some of them this is Lincoln taste

639
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Professor emeritus

640
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:13,088
Biology at UC Santa Cruz stay there very curious but want to see these experiments with

641
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Repeat it's very interesting experiment

642
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,488
I really want to see whether it's correct or not lead us to

643
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,608
He's got lots of questions about her research methods but really his major complaint is

644
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Is her language are use of metaphor

645
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Write example words

646
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,056
Like hearing or learning behavior and this is not a huge fan

647
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
Yes if you get

648
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,944
Too wrapped up in your poetic metaphor you're very likely

649
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
To be misled

650
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
And to over interpret the data

651
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
It's a kind of Romanticism I think you know

652
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
It goes back to

653
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
Anthropomorphizing

654
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Plant Behavior

655
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
I wonder if

656
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
Her using these metaphors

657
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Is

658
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
Perhaps a very creative way of looking at

659
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
Looking at a plant and therefore leaves her to make

660
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,920
Make up these experiments that those who wouldn't think the way she would whatever makeup and therefore she might

661
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
Indian see something that no one else would

662
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
What sea is it

663
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Pictures of metaphors letting in the light as opposed to shutting down the volume

664
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Just started like going off the deep end their butt

665
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Maybe it makes her sort of more open-minded than

666
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
And then somebody just looking at a note

667
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
I think you could be open-minded but

668
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
Still objective

669
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
I think there's something to that I I think

670
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
There are some cases

671
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Swear

672
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
Romanticizing something could possibly

673
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Lead you

674
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,784
Some interesting results to your like a a metaphor cop with a Milky

675
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,952
Yes that would be an interesting.

676
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
How much longer cuz I have an appoint

677
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,448
Home inspectors Alvin and Larry ubell

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,264
We thought maybe we should run this metaphor idea by then

679
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,128
There's on the science side there's a real suspicion of anything that's anthropomorphizing it

680
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,152
I just don't like

681
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
To hear words like mine or hear or see or taste for a plan because it's too animal into

682
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Too Human

683
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
And the classic case of this is what you go back up

684
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
A few centuries ago someone

685
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Notice that plants have sex

686
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
Oh yes that there was a kind of a moral objection to thinking of this

687
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
And I'm wondering whether

688
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:37,216
Monica is going to run into as she tries to make plants more animal-like

689
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Whether she's just going to run into this malice

690
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
From the scientific

691
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
You sure any of them know I don't

692
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Because

693
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
She may come up against the

694
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
People who think that

695
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Intelligence is unique to humans

696
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,648
And so I don't have a problem with that I've been looking around lately and I know that intelligence

697
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,952
Is not unique to humans okay

698
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
So I don't have an issue with that

699
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,328
And everyday that goes wanna have less of an issue from the day before

700
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
So I don't have a problem.

701
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
The problem is

702
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Is

703
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
With plants what they may have this

704
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Intelligent

705
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
Maybe we just not smart enough

706
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Figure it out

707
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
Well okay that's a Pareto

708
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Let's

709
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,736
Do it

710
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:36,096
Big things to ask your sponsor to Sharon Dela Cruz and to Peter Lander going to Princeton University Council on science and

711
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Allergy

712
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,728
Also thanks to Christy Melville and emerald O'Brien and Andres O'Hara and to summer rain

713
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
You thinking Summer Rae

714
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
Did the plants need that one in

715
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
The summer is a real person and her last name

716
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,480
To be spelled a y n e

717
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
This story was nurtured and fed and ultimately produced by Annie McEwen she actually trained the story and rather elaborate Express

718
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Middle set up

719
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
To move away from the light

720
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
A light Breeze

721
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Against

722
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Thinx

723
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,424
I want nothing thanks to Jennifer Frazier help us make sense of all this you should definitely go out and check out her Blog The Artful amoeba

724
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
Especially to the post the forlorn one

725
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
About plants

726
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Plants

727
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
Are really

728
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
Underrated

729
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
When I write a blog post

730
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
My post

731
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
They get the least traffic guaranteed are the plant pose

732
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,808
No matter how amazing I think that the results are

733
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
For some reason people just don't think plants

734
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Are interest

735
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
And

736
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Timmy

737
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
It's your three more reasons that you can say no really

738
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Plants are amazing
