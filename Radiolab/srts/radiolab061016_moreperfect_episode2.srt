1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey this is Dad so

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,352
A couple of us here have been working really hard for

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,632
Last few months on a

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
On a new spin-off

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,704
Radio apps for spinoff

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Called more perfect

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,568
It is a miniseries about the Supreme Court

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Working on it for months and months

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
We just released our first episode last

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
Next week we're super proud of it

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
And I'm talking to you now

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Cuz I want you to see

13
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
Describe the Spy

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
I think you will really like

15
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
If you like Radiolab you will like this

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,536
So I'm asking to do one better I don't know where she going to feature a couple of

17
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Episodes of Maury

18
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
Perfect on this pot

19
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
On Radiolab

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Cuz we know if we really

21
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
I think you'll like it

22
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,824
And that we hope you'll go to iTunes or Google or whatever it is you get your podcast and you subscribe

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
And you'll spread the word

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
The people listen to this thing

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
Maybe we'll keep doing it

26
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Alright so

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
What you're about to hear is episode

28
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
2 of March

29
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Perfect

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
Are you spending

31
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Supreme Court

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Episode one is already out

33
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,000
The Voice you're going to hear is Suzie lechtenberg

34
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Who is my main

35
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Collaborator on the project

36
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Choose long-time executive producer

37
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Freakonomics

38
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Shinar

39
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Cooking up this project

40
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
So

41
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Here it is episode 2

42
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,968
I think we should start the story on June 25th 1969

43
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
Urmc

44
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
I'm jazz

45
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
I'm ride this is more perfect okay so why

46
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Why 220 when was it

47
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
June 25th 1969

48
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,792
Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren is retiring or a Warren of the Warren Court

49
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Isn't that a big Court

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,704
Yeah that's what I think of you think of legendary

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Supreme Court judge

52
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Says he's probably in

53
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Top five

54
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
So he was one of the mount Olympians he's a big deal

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
Right now he's retiring so he's retiring he's been on the court for 16 years

56
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
And he's in an interview in his ass

57
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Would you list Master Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's most important decision you're 16 years here

58
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,768
Is kind of astounding

59
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,120
Not only of state legislatures by Porsche before you hear the answer

60
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
I think that you need to know that he could have said all kinds of cases he was the chief justice

61
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
During

62
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Miranda

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Remain silent

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
Or Gideon versus Wainwright

65
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Beauty

66
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
Harvey Specter

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,792
Athens Big Bore Brown versus Board of Education

68
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Mad when I know that one

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
He doesn't say any of those

70
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
What is issei

71
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
He says this little case called

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Scarface

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Baker vs. Carr

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
The Batcave

75
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
Is perhaps the most important case that who that

76
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Since I've been on the court

77
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
He thought that case whatever it is is more important than the case that desegregated the school

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
He did

79
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
So what the hell is it

80
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Exactly

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
No really what is it

82
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,680
It's this case that was so dramatic and so dramatic

83
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
But it apparently

84
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Broke to Justice

85
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
There was an instance in which

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
My

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
Brother found my father going upstairs

88
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
To get a shotgun

89
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Supreme Court of the United States

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
United States

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,056
United States and this honorable Court

92
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
Is this more perfect miniseries about the Supreme Court just a frame the story we're about to hear first

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Second

94
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
As we were putting the show together

95
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
We we hosted a panel discussion

96
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:31,359
A couple of us were on stage and a woman in the audience asked the following question

97
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
Address what I see is the

98
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,295
Increasing politicization of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was

99
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
You know voting

100
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Electing Bush to be our

101
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
President always been this way is this just my perception that it's becoming more popular

102
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,935
Size

103
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
I didn't know this until City started looking into it but there was a moment

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
When the Pandora's Box

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Just got ripped off

106
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,223
So I think they understand that moment and this story you have to get to know three care

107
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
These aren't necessarily the three most important justices of all time because of that time you had chief justice Earl

108
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Warren

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
And William Brennan on the court in these are kind of giants

110
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Supreme Court judge

111
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
But for this story

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
These three guys are

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
One of them is on the right

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
One of them is on the left

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
And one of them is just stuck right in the middle

116
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Tragically in the middle

117
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,359
On the conservative side

118
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Oliviana expression or action by the state

119
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,319
Did Justice Frankfurter was one of the most sweetest name is really Frankfurter

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
One of the most

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Influential Justice

123
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,023
Of all time I bet taragrove she teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School

124
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
A very influential scholar at Harvard Law

125
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
School before he became adjust

126
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
With a close adviser to Franklin Delano Roosevelt

127
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
He was extremely smart

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Towering figure

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
But as a person

130
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Justice

131
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
Justice Frankfurter

132
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
He wasn't necessarily the nicest

133
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Person

134
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
I heard that from everyone else

135
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
I always call him a Bantam rooster

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,647
He was a difficult Krusty figure this short

137
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
A little bit of a pouch on

138
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,791
Was one of the most

139
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
He was a tough cut

140
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,191
When a when a clerk would come to the u.s. Supreme Court Chambers to deliver a message

141
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
In the person of the door

142
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
Tried to hand Justice Frankfurter the paper

143
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
Frankfurter would inevitably Let It Drop to the ground

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
So the person had to bend down and

145
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Pick it up

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Two handed to him again

147
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Dude that's a

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
And by the way the voices you heard besides Tara Grover professors Mike seidman Georgetown University

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,119
Girlfriend won't School Craig Smith California University of Pennsylvania Supreme Court Clerk

150
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,007
Elenco involuntario hn okay so Frankfurter is on one side of the aisle and his nemesis

151
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
Is a gentleman on the other side of the aisle illiberal named William O Douglas

152
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
He was Justice Douglas now in the Supreme Court chamber

153
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,159
This is a recording from a 1957 interview with Justice Douglas

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
Looks very well as faces 10 rubbing his eyes sparkle

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Mountain climbing environmentalist

156
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Big and civil liberties

157
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
I think this this song coming generation is more aware of the importance of civil liberties and crashed biking

158
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Generation Y unlike Justice Frankfurter

159
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Douglas was a prick

160
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
To everybody around him everybody hated

161
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,807
All those same adjective

162
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Applied

163
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Here's how the New York Times described them

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
Habitual Drinker and uncaring parents Douglas was married four times

165
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Killing on each of his first three wives with her

166
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
This is footage from his last marriage to his wife Kathleen

167
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
He was 67

168
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
She was 23

169
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
So yes

170
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Yes that it that is William Douglas

171
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
See how these two guys Frankfurter the Bantam rooster Douglas

172
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
The prick and

173
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
As you can imagine vacature

174
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
They just despise

175
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
The Frankfurter had this habit of monologuing and while he would go on and on Douglas would just pull out a book right in front of them

176
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Start reading you know he was just opening his the same for Frankfurter I actually found a series of interviews

177
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,079
We're done with Douglas in the early sixties where he basically calls Frankfurter names

178
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Time

179
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Wow

180
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Why they hate each other so much

181
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
According to Mike seidman some of that comes

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
From maybe there

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Difference in background Frankfurter was

184
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
A Jewish immigrant from Austria

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,055
A Douglas was a western

186
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
But according to him

187
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Or of their hatred

188
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
Actually was ideological reflected

189
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
I really important split

190
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,135
Over how powerful the court should be

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
Quartz just want not to intervene and he believed that many matter should be left up to the political process

192
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
And the courts should stay out of those issues

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Courts want to intervene to protect for example minority groups Free Speech rights things of that sort

194
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Do you have this personal Feud going you had this

195
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,759
Ideological war that was brewing in the court and into the middle of all of this

196
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
Walks Charles Whitaker

197
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
You might call him the Swing Vote

198
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,119
Okay this is Alan Cohen Supreme Court

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Clerk for justice Whitaker

200
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
From 1957

201
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
21958

202
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
Whitaker grew up in a small town in Kansas

203
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Just called Troy

204
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Antithesis of flashy

205
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
This is his granddaughter

206
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,831
It's kind of a one-room schoolhouse overview Little Red Schoolhouse work on the farm but he

207
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,183
He he determined that was not the life for him

208
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Kate says when he was around sixteen he became obsessed with the idea of becoming a lawyer and she says he would actually practice law

209
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
To the animals

210
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
Can you imagine you know pushing

211
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
The plow along in the fields and them lecturing and arguing cases to the cows or to the horses or whatever

212
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
I hear that he was lecturing yes

213
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,295
Oh and on the side he was he would hunt he would hunt the squirrels opossum raccoon

214
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,695
I need sell the pelts for a few dollars I think $700 would that money put himself through loss

215
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,559
My understanding is that he simultaneously went to law school and high school

216
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
What which is just mind-boggling but yeah apparently he went to the head of the law school in Kansas City and he's like I don't

217
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
High school diploma but you need to let me in

218
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
The dean just saw how ambitious he was and he was impressed means like Alright you're in

219
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
I love this guy

220
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
He's like Mr bootstrap

221
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,551
Totaling any how to make a long story short the top lawyer and Alan Cohen says that because he would

222
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,671
Do better than all of his opponents he would outwork them out prepare the great attention to detail

223
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Great

224
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Presents before a jury

225
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
And then he becomes a judge for a federal district judge and then an appeals court judge

226
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
And in February of 1957

227
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,775
Gets the call so I recall it was in the evening and asked if he could be in Washington

228
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Nginx

229
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Morning this is Kent Whitaker

230
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Charles Whitaker

231
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,223
He should certainly but my best blue suit is at the cleaners tonight

232
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
What did he wear

233
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
As a matter of fact

234
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,391
My mother or someone else got the cleaners open up at night

235
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
In the first allegation

236
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,167
Tending to show data corporation's right of exercise of Free Will at them

237
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
This is one of the first time that Whitaker spoke on the bench and he innergex with a question for the attorney and he is Midwestern

238
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
What I have

239
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
The thing is crazy to me is it

240
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
He walked into the highest court in the land in

241
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
He didn't even go to college

242
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
I think it's important to understand

243
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
That he had no formal education real

244
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Another way she never took history

245
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
Political science or social science

246
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
But do you love the law my father was not an ideologue

247
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
He expected

248
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
The court to be

249
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,223
An arena in which there were Lively arguments on legal issues

250
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
And that's what he enjoyed what

251
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
What's really good at

252
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
What what are you love

253
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
Has Kent Whitaker puts it

254
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,231
His dad was kind of the walking embodiment of that thing that

255
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
Chief Justice John Roberts said back in 2005

256
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,887
During his confirmation hearing for chairman I come before the committee with no agenda

257
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
He was sort of a blank slate my job to call balls and Strikes

258
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
And not the pitch

259
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Or bat

260
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,151
My father was not interested in advancing a cause or a

261
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
Siri but frankly that's adjusted

262
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Should be that you are approaching it without a political agenda and that you're deciding it I think

263
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Exactly right

264
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
But

265
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
In practice

266
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
So many of their case

267
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
There is no law

268
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
To turn to to decide those cases

269
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,031
Ken says that his dad quickly discovered that law that Supreme Court is never clean cut

270
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
Cases make it there precisely because the lot isn't clear my name

271
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
These are just

272
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
Without pressure in those cases

273
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
You have must

274
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Care of your ideology

275
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
As a

276
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
As a starting

277
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
And the fact that he didn't have an ideology

278
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
That was invulnerable he was definitely getting lobbied

279
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
From both sides

280
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Sprinkler on one side Douglas on the other

281
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
You were the new kid on the Block and was being pulled by

282
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Each one like

283
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,639
The way the judges bowling for votes within his first three months he found himself in the middle of a death penalty

284
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
She was found in her bedroom by fireman

285
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Take a note

286
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Turn that after 4 now

287
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,671
A guy I've been tried for arson and murder and Douglas and liberals wanted to intervene to help them

288
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
They feel like you've been treated unfairly by the lower courts

289
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
But Frankford when the conservatives thought that the Supreme Court should be

290
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
They should honor president according to Justice Douglas

291
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Justice Whittaker was undecided all

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
Douglas would tell him one thing

293
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
That seems right and then just

294
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Something else

295
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
I think there was some thought that you

296
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
You might

297
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Shein

298
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
The guy who talked with him last

299
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
You know

300
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
He ends up being so undecided on this death penalty case that he forces the court

301
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
To delay the vote until the next

302
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
In the world series of cases like

303
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,887
Read aloud be fuzzy ideologies would Harden and Whitaker he would be right in the middle

304
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,751
The physical depictions of him in that first year from people who saw him

305
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,823
Describe somebody who was

306
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Restless

307
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Terribly unhappy

308
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
I had lost a lot of weight nervous

309
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
With agitated most

310
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
The time

311
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
It was a lot of stress.

312
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Whitaker that in normal Cortana California procedures and butt over the next week

313
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,911
Here's your fences back you find this week

314
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
His production increase

315
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Eventually

316
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
Third-year his fourth year and part of his V

317
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,943
He wrote as many opinions that is any other judge

318
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
He wrote as many dissenting opinions as any other judge

319
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
He was one of the nine it was

320
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Fully employed

321
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,183
And he wrote some very important opinions during that

322
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Period of time

323
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Along came a bigger versus

324
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Scar

325
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
And it's broken

326
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
Hi this is Shireen from

327
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:59,391
Sunrise Florida Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

328
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world more information about Sloan

329
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Www

330
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
. Sloane. Org

331
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,495
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

332
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,615
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

333
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

334
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,087
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

335
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,719
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

336
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,071
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

337
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,703
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

338
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

339
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the kids in math class

340
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
Notice their writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

341
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

342
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Have anything to do with the test

343
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
If you have a story please share it with us

344
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791

Thank you so much

348
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,087
Avis more perfect I'm Jedi from riding a story from Suzie lechtenberg

349
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
But the case that broke to Jessie

350
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Number

351
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:43,327
123 Charles W Baker at Alcatel appellant versus Josie car

352
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,679
Okay so it's April 19th 1961

353
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,079
The Supreme Court is hearing Baker vs. Carr

354
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Does an individual

355
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
Voting rights

356
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
11 qualified voters in the state of Tennessee

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
Not on the surface Baker vs. Carr was about districts and how people are counted in this country and this is why

358
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
One of the most basic ways that political power gets assigned in America

359
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
That growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people that are representing them but at that time in 10

360
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Has he hadn't changed its legislative districts

361
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
Since 1901 which was 60 years earlier will this created big problems

362
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,415
For urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years

363
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
People move to the cities in droves and rural areas were getting smaller and put the Tennessee State Legislature

364
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:52,191
Had refused to update account and it was still giving more representation to those rural areas

365
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
In Tennessee

366
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
The figure was 23.

367
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
NYU Law Professor Sam is that girl

368
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
For people that don't understand how does it actually delete your vote well

369
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
This is very

370
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
You have one District that has

371
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
One person in it

372
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
And you have another District

373
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Trick that has 23

374
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
The district that has one person gives all the power to the

375
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
The district at

376
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Has 23 people

377
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Spread it out over

378
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Ultimate

379
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
T3

380
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
What are you think of it this way

381
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
At that time a person in the city in Tennessee

382
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Had one 23rd as much of a voice in the legislature as a person living in the countryside and

383
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,967
Here's sort of the Insidious underbelly of that

384
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,319
It just so happened that the people living in the countryside or mostly White

385
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
And a large percentage of the people living in the city were black

386
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,231
Underlying all of the reapportionment litigation leasing South was

387
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
White supremacy

388
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
That's Doug Smith

389
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,679
Historian in the author of on democracy's doorstep this is deeply tied to whites

390
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
Supremacy in the maintenance of Jim Crow was a method of making sure that rural

391
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
A white legislators continue to control the power structure

392
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
So you had the situation he says we're a small minority was choking the majority

393
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Suburban areas from any sort of any sorts of funds cities couldn't get the money they needed for Rhodes education Social Services soda

394
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,280
The question at the Supreme Court was and they actually tackle this in two separate things

395
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
What should they do about

396
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
And here's where you get to the ideological Smackdown liberals on the court like Douglas

397
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:39,200
Basically agree with the plaintiff when they argue

398
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,144
Liberals are like yeah this is clearly an injustice people in the cities are getting screwed

399
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,520
Their voting rights have been diluted in the basement

400
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
But conservatives are like yes people are getting hurt

401
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
But we're not going to do anything

402
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
We can't Frankfurter

403
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
Firstly said we cannot get involved that as bad as it says it was not an issue that the court should get involved in right now

404
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
Unique situation

405
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
If we end up doing this in Tennessee pretty soon we'll be intervening in California South Carolina

406
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
Will be rewriting entire us legislative map

407
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Tennessee

408
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,368
This is the United States not

409
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Yes so

410
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,000
Basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in politics

411
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,608
And he really believe that the court should never ever get involved in politics

412
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,240
This is a this is an idea that goes way back to something called

413
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
Political question Doctrine

414
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
The political question Doctrine says

415
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
No federal court can decide this issue at all

416
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
Quartz simply had no business

417
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
Getting into what were considered to be fundamentally political

418
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,904
Questions and what could be more fun in my life political than the makeup of the legislature it's a philosophy

419
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
To feed rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not be substitute

420
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Shooting their will

421
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,168
For the will of the people's elected representatives

422
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
Frankfort like even if you have a terrible political situation if the justices stepped in and overruled the legislature

423
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,176
That would be worse than doing nothing at all because it would be fundamentally undemocratic

424
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
I'm he viewed

425
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
He view the political question Doctrine

426
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
Is a crucial limitation on the Federal Judicial power

427
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,952
And he wasn't alone the courts at follow this guideline for about a hundred and fifty years

428
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,560
And even with the current case in Tennessee federal court that first heard the case

429
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Recognized

430
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
The situation actually referred to it as in evil

431
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,592
But this is the decision that this is a political question

432
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,456
Malapportionment is a political question and only the political branches can handle this

433
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
They have no power

434
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Anything about

435
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Protecting and enforcing

436
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
Voting rights

437
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
So

438
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,304
When the lawyer for Tennessee got up there

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Play jokes

440
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
He didn't try to defend her Tennessee was counting or not counting its people he basically said yeah what we're doing is bad

441
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
But it's nobody's job but hours to fix

442
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
Is it worth

443
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
The legislature of Tennessee

444
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Not

445
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
The real Porsha

446
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
Or is it

447
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Warriors

448
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
Federal District Court

449
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Violate

450
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
He basically said if you step in you're going to screw up the balance of power in America the power

451
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,400
I want America comes from we the people not the courts

452
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
So this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected representatives if the whole problem

453
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
Is that you don't have a voice in The Ledges

454
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
So then how can you suddenly

455
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Have a voice

456
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
In legislature

457
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,296
I mean either way to change it would be SC legislature itself where to give up power and why would they do that

458
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
Can of course once elected officials are in

459
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Power

460
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
They have a vested interest

461
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,488
And keeping their districts exactly as they are because

462
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,816
Those are the districts that elected them and fundamentally

463
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:44,448
Electoral Representatives knew that if they redrew the lines and they would be

464
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,544
Voting themselves out of political power

465
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
ASCII Charles Professor Duke Law School

466
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Not to do anything

467
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
So for the Liberals on the court they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be fixed

468
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
And nobody was going to fix it if they didn't fix

469
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
Frankfurter he's like if you fix this one you're going to fix that one and that one and that one and that one and where's it going to stop

470
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
If you do this

471
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
There is no way out the Court's going to get stuck and what he called political Thicket

472
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,824
The political Thicket the court must not enter the political Thicket

473
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,712
Karina Street Last Words the imagery of the thicket is that you know the deer very

474
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
Proudly with his new horn

475
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Goes into the

476
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
The thicket

477
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Gets entangled

478
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Never get out

479
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Frankfurt

480
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Volume was

481
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
Once the courts are in there will be nothing Beyond

482
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
Bonded and someday

483
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
The courts will be

484
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
Forced to declare winners and losers a very high-profile action

485
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
Okay so after the oral arguments are over in Baker vs. Carr the justices Head Inn

486
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,784
The conference that's a meeting with just an EIN

487
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
Right down the middle and Charles Whitaker

488
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,928
He was a potential Swing Vote was deeply torn

489
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
He been leaning frankfurters way

490
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
But

491
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Clear constitutional

492
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Right

493
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,288
Finish this for the first argument he asked a number of questions that suggested a great deal of sympathy with

494
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
When is the knot

495
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Power

496
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
In the course

497
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
Constitutional right there's a lot of thought that he might actually come down on the side of

498
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,416
Of the plaintiffs medication I threw a Frankfurter really

499
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
Really buganda to rip into him

500
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Right after the first real argument

501
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Drake on

502
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
Even 90 minutes speech

503
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Search Oxford

504
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
90 +

505
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Straight minutes

506
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,264
Darting around the room pulling books off the shelves

507
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
Pulling books off the shelf reading

508
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
From prior cases gesticulating wildly

509
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,736
To make his point and the whole time looking directly at Whitaker

510
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,880
There was one account that I heard where Frankfurter went on for 4 hours

511
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:17,536
4 hours really lecturing Whitaker really really belittling him

512
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes it was it was horribly intimidating

513
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
At one point one of the justices on the liberal side

514
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
Justice Hugo Black

515
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
It took Whitaker side was trying to make

516
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Can feel better and black said to Charles Whitaker just remember we're all boys grown tall

517
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,064
We're not the gods who sit on high and dispense Justice

518
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,928
But it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role

519
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
Particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything

520
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
This started weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind

521
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,544
He was disturbed by the by having the weight of Spring Court on his shoulders

522
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
According to his family Kate and Ken's my mother tells me that he

523
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
At that time was under a lot of

524
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
Stress and spoke as though he were dictated spoke his punctuation

525
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
Hello Judas, it's very nice to meet you could clearly thinking about everything that he

526
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
Might say being recorded

527
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
I remember his

528
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
Stating that he felt like

529
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,824
All the words that he ordered were being chiseled in stone as a result of Leaky Shed

530
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
You don't talk much

531
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,392
So after they heard the case the first time wudaokou couldn't make up his mind

532
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,488
And actually incidentally there is another Justice Justice Stewart

533
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
Who was the other Swing Vote in the case

534
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Who also couldn't make up his mind

535
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,680
The court decided to hear the case again in the fall

536
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
Just because they needed more time

537
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,640
And over the summer remain deeply divided that he actually

538
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,944
Written memos on both sides of the issue

539
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Doug Smith says Whitaker wrote both and opinion for intervening and Baker vs. Carr and Addison tag in

540
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Intervening in Baker vs. Carr

541
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:26,048
At the same time as he circulates

542
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,448
60 page memo explaining how this was a political question that should not be decided by the chords

543
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
He's God

544
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
A fire in his belly

545
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
He's not going to let this

546
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Number 6

547
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
Charles W Baker at Alice Cullen

548
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Monday

549
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
October 9th

550
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
1961

551
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,064
It's 10 a.m. and the court is back in session

552
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
Lawyer arguing the case against the Tennessee legislature begins to talk

553
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,072
Frankfurter stood quietly for about 5 minutes listening

554
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Without the lights

555
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,984
And then he starts

556
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,968
You gave a minute ago

557
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,792
Of course.

558
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
Frankfurter hammers the attorneys with questions

559
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
During the course of oral arguments

560
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:40,544
He speaks approximately 170 * 170 + 70

561
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Charles Whitaker

562
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Have some

563
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
For the allocation

564
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Amish legislatures to districts

565
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
17 *

566
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Well

567
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,648
After nearly four hours of oral arguments

568
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
The justice is recess

569
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
And going to conference

570
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
Frankfurter needed

571
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Desperate

572
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
He had a gun

573
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
And he would

574
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
Kept asking

575
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Like a

576
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,008
Dog after a bone

577
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Trying to persuade him

578
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
And that

579
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,384
Harassing a guy. I have to make a point

580
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
It was a nightmare

581
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
And I saw the night

582
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
How so

583
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Describe it to me well

584
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
He was

585
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
A nervous wreck and like

586
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,656
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I found out I don't know if he told me or his wife told me

587
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
He was on tranquilizers

588
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Overcome

589
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
What he thought was just work-related

590
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
Stress will clearly

591
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
Something was taking

592
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Hold of him

593
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
Who had trouble concentrating

594
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,760
Highway fraud I would characterize

595
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,808
Here's eventual breakdown

596
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,368
It's something of a slow descent

597
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,744
By the early spring after the court had returned from

598
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
Winter recess

599
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,096
Whitaker was absent from the

600
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Court

601
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,496
You mean like he just didn't either getting chill for work one day

602
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,312
Apparently so Splurge didn't know where he was

603
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
The other justices

604
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Didn't

605
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Know his whereabouts

606
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
He just

607
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Appeared

608
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Really in the middle

609
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
Of what's going to become one of the

610
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
Your Monumental decisions of the 20th century

611
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
He disappeared

612
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
She had to it

613
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Escape

614
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Where'd you go

615
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Well

616
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,400
He went to really what would be a cabin in the woods

617
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
In the middle of Wisconsin

618
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,592
And he called up one of his former law says he's in Kansas City to come up and join him

619
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
And according to Craig Smith

620
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,712
He in the sky whose name was Sam Milby

621
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
They would just

622
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Set there

623
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
On the bank of the lake

624
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
In silence

625
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
They would sit for hours on end not talking to each other

626
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
Just waiting for the justice

627
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Speak

628
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,864
We have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment but

629
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
I imagine he was just

630
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
Sitting there and he was thinking about these two realities that could unfold like

631
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
On the one hand

632
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
If a court stepped into politics

633
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:58,176
They can protect people

634
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
But on the other hand

635
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,488
President with the set

636
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,584
Would it make the court too powerful

637
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
How much case

638
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
W bush do to protect the people

639
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
Imagines mine went back and forth and back and forth

640
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,224
And when Whitaker decided he really had to get back to work than this

641
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
Protege would say to him

642
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
No just relax

643
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
Did you just take it easy and

644
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
Get yourself together before you decide to go back

645
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
After 3 weeks

646
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
Justice Whittaker returns to DC

647
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Back to worship

648
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
For a few days

649
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
But can't again his son

650
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
We found my father to be

651
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
Really in extremis

652
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,784
And debate and end I think I'm borderline suicidal

653
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
When you said that he was suicidal what do you mean

654
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,976
There was an instance in which my

655
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
Brother found my father going upstairs to get a shotgun

656
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
A few days later

657
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,592
Charles Whitaker checks himself into a hospital

658
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
There is

659
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,480
Some evidence that it was really Justice Douglas Who convinced Whitaker

660
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Go to the hospital

661
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
That's Justice William Douglas again

662
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
Hospital

663
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
A few weeks later March 29th 1962 the presidential press conference

664
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
From the new state department Auditorium

665
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
Washington DC

666
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
Several announcements to make

667
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
It is with extreme regret

668
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
That I announce the retirement of associate justices

669
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Supreme Court

670
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
Charles Evans Whittaker

671
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Effective April 1st

672
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Justice Whittaker

673
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
Remember the Supreme Court for nearly five years

674
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
Have the federal judiciary

675
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Beignets

676
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Is retiring at the direction of his position

677
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Reasons of disability

678
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
I know that the bench in the bar

679
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Of the entire nation

680
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,288
Join me in commending this to Justice Whitaker

681
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
First devoted service to his country

682
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
During a critical period and its history

683
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,528
Text I want to take this opportunity to stress again the importance

684
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
The tax bill now before the House of Representatives

685
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Wow

686
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
Whatever happened with the case with Bakery card

687
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
Whitaker didn't vote on Baker vs. Carr

688
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
So you could say that this

689
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Case that

690
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Essentially broken

691
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
His vote didn't count

692
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
Around the time that he was in the hospital they were sort of the liberal coup at the court where Frankfurter lost a couple of other

693
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
So in the end the decision actually wasn't very close at all

694
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
What was it

695
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
It was 6

696
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
2

697
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole kind of cluster we've been fighting over of how

698
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
How States in Tennessee Count Their voters

699
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,488
But this is something the court can and should look at

700
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
So another words I decided to

701
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Lower their arms and go into the thicket

702
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
Oh yeah they did

703
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,984
And just one or two final questions of what happened to Justice Frankfurter

704
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
The thing that I find

705
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Crabs most extraordinary

706
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:14,176
Is it less than two weeks after decision in Baker versus car came down

707
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,016
Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme Court

708
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
And

709
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
Frankfurter secretary found him

710
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
Sprawled on the floor of his office

711
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
From a stroke

712
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
He suffered a massive stroke

713
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,768
And the never return to service

714
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,608
And while he was in the hospital solicitor-general Archibald

715
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Cox

716
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Visit a Frankfurter

717
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
And Frankfurter

718
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
He was in a wheelchair

719
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
I could barely speak

720
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
But he

721
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Apparently convey John Archibald

722
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
Wilcox

723
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
That the decision

724
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
Baker vs. Carr had essentially caused

725
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Stroke

726
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
He felt

727
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
So passionate

728
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
The court should

729
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Stay out of the

730
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
McKay's

731
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Statkey physically

732
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Physically deteriorated

733
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
After the court

734
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Gone the other way

735
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,296
After Baker vs. Carr President Kennedy essentially had to Supreme Court vacancies to fill

736
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,880
Now Whitaker seat he filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate

737
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Frankfurters vacancy that second vacancy

738
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
That vacancy

739
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
See

740
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,120
That will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg

741
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
That is the fifth vote

742
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
That

743
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
The four liberals

744
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,360
What are regarded as the four liberals that becomes the fifth vote that they need

745
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:52,736
Really to create what has come to be regarded as the Warren Court Revolution

746
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
This is when the Supreme Court basically became an agent for social change

747
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Begins with a 1962 term that's the revolution that is going to change

748
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
One man one vote in a political boundaries

749
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
Confession the way we think of Criminal Justice

750
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,064
The way we treat 1st Amendment religious and obscenity issues

751
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
That's the Warren court that people run

752
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Member

753
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:36,768
And that's the court that came into existence when Felix Frankfurter left

754
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:45,216
And so just thinking about that question that that woman asked all the way at the beginning of the story

755
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Could you

756
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,544
Address what I see is the

757
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
Increasing politicization

758
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
Of the corriere papios is of which I guess was

759
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
Yoona voting

760
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
OLX Ching Bush to be

761
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
President you can

762
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,695
Kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker versus car

763
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
All the way to December 9th

764
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Mm

765
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,655
The polls in six new states have just closed and the lead story at this hour is

766
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
The state

767
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Florida is to

768
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Close

769
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
I think feel transported would have said

770
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
See

771
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
That's what I told you that's what would happen

772
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
Is that eventually you will you will be deciding a

773
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Autism

774
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Which

775
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
Presidential candidate

776
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,647
Essentially received the most

777
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Boat

778
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
For those who

779
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
Felt themselves on the losing side of bush V Gore

780
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
This was just

781
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Does frankfurters

782
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
This was the moment

783
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Bad Baker

784
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Car head

785
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
When I teach this to students

786
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,407
And particularly in the decade.

787
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Ricoh R1

788
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
The Descent sent to Ben

789
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Sentiments about this

790
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Still quite Raw

791
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,111
I would say to them well

792
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Is this

793
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Was Frankfurter right

794
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,255
And I remember a student in the

795
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Who said

796
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
In class I never thought I would

797
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
I would say this

798
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
But

799
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Because I hated the outcome and

800
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Bush V Gore I was

801
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
So angry

802
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Proceeded

803
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
But if

804
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
Bush V Gore

805
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
The price we have to pay

806
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
4

807
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
The courts make

808
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
In the overall

809
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
System

810
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Work

811
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
Somewhat more tolerable

812
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Play properly

813
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,527
It's a price I'm willing

814
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
If we totally sign off what

815
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:48,095
The Douglas Weiser lost track of time so after Baker vs. Carr was decided he went on to be a Supreme Court Justice for

816
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,495
13 more years and to this day he actually holds the record for being the longest-serving justice of all time 30

817
00:43:54,751 --> 00:44:00,895
Frankfurter so Baker vs. Carr was the last case that he ever heard

818
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
And he died a few years afterwards recover

819
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695
After Whitaker retired from the court he moved back to Kansas City with his family and his son said that it took them about

820
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
About two years to get better from his nervous breakdown but he did get better and eventually he got a job as counsel

821
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Open General Motors but

822
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,935
He never returned the benching never was a judge again

823
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
