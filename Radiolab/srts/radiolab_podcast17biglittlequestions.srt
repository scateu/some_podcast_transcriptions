1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,576
Hey I'm Jared I'm rubber, which is Radiolab and today

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
We're going to hit the phones

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
Hello

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Starting with this guy

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Mark Morrison

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,792
Hey Mark this is Jed calling from Radiolab

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Got ahold of him at his home in Olympia Washington

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
Houston traffic

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,336
All right maybe we should just jump in and you should just tell me the story

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
I was DJing a wedding

14
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
Out in Lacey

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Next town over

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
It was a hot

17
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Like

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Late spring time

19
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
Feeling like summer kind of day

20
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
And

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
A little rented

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,072
Facility that had like Windows on all sides and all the sudden the power starts flickering

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
And it starts

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Raining

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
Really hard

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Ben

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Free

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Are falling over

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Wendy's

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Disgusting

32
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
And if the sky turns

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Tonight

34
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Well

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Like 3:30 in the after

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,576
So Mark takes off goes back home

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Hang out with the new baby

38
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
And

39
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
We open up the curtain

40
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,024
Turn off all the lights and we're just kind of marveling

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Insane power of the

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Storm is happening

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
My wife

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
It is sitting on the couch my two year old

45
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Watching

46
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
Charlie Brown or something on

47
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
IPad

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
And then all of a sudden

49
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Thursday

50
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Snap like the sound of a whip crack

51
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
Or like

52
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Like a two-by-four be

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Snapped in half

54
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
And about

55
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Whitney Houston

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
2 feet in

57
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Front of my face

58
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Right next to my mother-in-law and the baby

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
There

60
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
A little

61
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Beer

62
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Of light

63
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
White light

64
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Just a little or

65
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
Size of like maybe an orange or a grapefruit

66
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Blurry edges around it

67
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
Floating in mid-air

68
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
Is bright is like the sun

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
They're like the bright it lit up

70
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
The entire room

71
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Wow

72
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
We all

73
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
Everybody in the room in unity

74
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
And Marx says this

75
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Sun orbs

76
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Covered in front of his face

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Muah muah muah baby a second when all the sudden

78
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Who's gone

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Yeah

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,984
That's some X-Files that right there

81
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
None of us had

82
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
Any idea what the heck happened

83
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
What did you go around the room be like

84
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Did you guys see that did you see that

85
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
Everybody thought everybody thought

86
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
My mother-in-law thought that I had like taken

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Cadillac firework

88
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
Throwing it up in the air

89
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
What did you

90
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Do

91
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
I didn't do anything

92
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
So what I did was

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
I started trying to Google it and there is

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Piano

95
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,704
Imagine trying to Google that you're not going to find anything

96
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Type into Google

97
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Fear of light floating

98
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Indoors

99
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
I didn't get very far

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,320
But I just wanted to get to the bottom of it

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
And so what Mark did

102
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
Is he setting of the computer any typed up this email

103
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,048
Basically saying like what the hell is this

104
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
And then he

105
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Sent that email

106
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Into the void

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
Which would be at

108
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
Gmail inbox

109
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,128
You know it's sat around for a while because we tend to get these kinds of questions

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
A lot

111
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,016
Are there more stars in the universe or grains of sand on earth

112
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
A lot a lot is it clean a minivan sticker V Apple why do some birds walk and other top kind of fish here why are horses

113
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Especially good things with a traffic jam random questions like

114
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,191
I don't poop questions why is different animal species act differently what happens when you flush a toilet

115
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,823
They just sorta pile-up we should have put them in this bucket year and then feel guilty about not answering them

116
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,407
And over the years while they keep coming so the bucket gets Fuller

117
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
And Fuller

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
+ 4

119
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
It's okay okay

120
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Let's just dump the bucket app

121
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
Until we're going to try and answer some of these questions today

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Beginning with the question about

123
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
The orbit can I speak to Martin please

124
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,639
Peter tok them

125
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
University of Florida

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Thank is it still good time to chat

127
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
It is about the only time because I'm going to go to dinner in about 10 minutes

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
How long we going to talk

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Well

130
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,791
So I told Martin the story thunderstorm boom glowing or poof gone

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Ya basic questions you like what is that

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
Well that observation is not uncommon and it's

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Call Jenna Lee called ball lightning

134
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Ball light

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
That's what it's called

136
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
An accordion Martin ball lightning

137
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Is timeless

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
Describe exactly the same thing

139
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
19th century and 18th century that used to commonly

140
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Come down the chimney

141
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Come out the fireplace

142
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Bow Wow

143
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
Analysis Martin we are living in an electronic world and so these balls of lightning

144
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,655
I'm Donovan telephone in airplanes they happen in submarines

145
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,727
Actually that's been reported

146
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,615
Lightning strikes outside an airplane and Eyeball comes to the windshield and floats down the whole plane

147
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
If I'm in that plane I'm thinking right

148
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Where your depends anytime you got electrical stuff going on you can make a ball of fire like that

149
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
So do we know anything about what causes

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
What it is exactly is it just another form of lightning that somehow manages to wall itself up and hang around

151
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Martin is actually one of the few people who has studied

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Ball lightning in the lab exe got funded by DARPA

153
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Trying to figure out how it works

154
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Wasn't quite able to

155
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
He says what's likely happening is it

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
When a bolt of lightning strikes might hit something

157
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
Boil water tree

158
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Substance

159
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,671
It's lit up and somehow phone to self into a sphere like a balloon there a bubble or something

160
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Like if you imagine

161
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Lightning hit some dust

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Shocks the Dust

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Changes chemistry

164
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
So that form some kind of

165
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Spiracles

166
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
Scaffolding

167
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
In the lightning

168
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Sticks to the scaffolding or something

169
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Maybe that's what's happening

170
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
You can't prove it there's some Theory which indicates that that might happen

171
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
But if you go in the laboratory

172
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
You trying to make it

173
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
You can't make it

174
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
So can't prove it

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
And

176
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,207
If you get a book on ball lightning or you get my book and look at the chapter on ball lightning

177
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
You'll see probably a list of 50 different theories of people of come up with

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
All the way up

179
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
Black holes and then discontinuities and time space and

180
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Things that are just

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Completely

182
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Almost out of this world

183
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
So they remain a mystery

184
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
But

185
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Well observed history

186
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,391
And other people don't have any good math for how lightning get started in a cloud

187
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,743
Really I didn't know that we don't know what how lightning can get started

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Shouldn't be able to

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
It shouldn't really be based on what the math says there's not enough money

190
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Saint Cloud

191
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
So you're saying understood

192
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Almost nothing is understood

193
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Floundering around

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Distance

195
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,647
Do you find yourself thinking about ball lightning and then suddenly just tiptoeing into an existential crisis

196
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
How little we know of the world

197
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,863
So I make my living as trying to uncover a little bit little more bits by little more bits but

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Yo there's lots of it at 9

199
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Mixed up producer Tracy hunt

200
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Goes on a field trip

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
Justin the very Hallowed Ground

202
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
The New York Public Library

203
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
The New York

204
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:41,119
Public Library

205
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
What is floryday

206
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,055
Right here in the grand hall is a beautiful chandeliers all over the place is gorgeous

207
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Collinwood field

208
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Millions of books

209
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
In every field of human endeavor

210
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,295
Row upon row upon row of shelves

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
Close to fifty centuries of human thinking

212
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,999
Millions of visitors like Tracy would walk through these hallowed Halls

213
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Question questions fueled by curiosity the desire for truth or knowledge for wisdom people trying to unravel

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
The mysteries of

215
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
The universe

216
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
I came here to ask him a question about catnip

217
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Cabinet

218
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
Yes catnip why why why can't I

219
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
So we actually got like

220
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
500 questions from our listeners

221
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
So I thought it might be good idea to take some of them to the library

222
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
So I met up with this woman

223
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
She walk me into this office

224
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
There's about like I don't know

225
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,543
All people sitting at their death

226
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
Imanage ask my DL and I've been in this department for about 5 years

227
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Smione

228
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,295
Nypl it's 917 ask nypl and putting phone number out there

229
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
And if you call them

230
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
And you ask him a question

231
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
It's their job to answer

232
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Yes and so we are

233
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,535
Like a call center so article day

234
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Starts with questions

235
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
And I get a typical day honey

236
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
150 to 200 and resumes telling me that most of the questions they get it will the weather be like this weekend.

237
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
Boring pay my library card expired or I wonder when you

238
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,759
Spock you know also they they get some weird ones

239
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Ichthammol

240
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Yeah

241
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
So I got a list right here and in the past they've gotten things like

242
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
What kind of apple did eat is it proper to go alone to Reno to get a divorce statistics on the lifespan of the abandoned woman

243
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Elicense in India what is the natural enemy of the book telling me how to be a mistress of Ceremonies at a musical or what does it mean when you dream

244
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Elephant

245
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
Advanced robot

246
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Biltrite

247
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
I was maybe a little dismissive

248
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Ford fuel pump

249
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
I mean all the questions

250
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Of course you're very important

251
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
We welcome all questions

252
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Play this by the way is Bernard Bernard and Marsha Bean has been working for asking my plc's about

253
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
2001 answer the question he did answer my catnip question which is large feline species like tigers and lions

254
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Lions have the same reaction to catnip

255
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
As domestic cats

256
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Yes I cats like catnip apparently tigers at least that I had all these questions so actually had them

257
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Take one that they thought was super interesting which one did you pick

258
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Tooth answer

259
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Having me get the exact wording

260
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
So

261
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,087
Yeah so here we go could you play a meaningful game of frisbee on the surf

262
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Pics of Mars

263
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
End

264
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
Yeah that was a good one and I think the word that makes it like just

265
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Really shine is

266
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Meaningful

267
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
So

268
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
The first thing he does you want to get me kind of doing some

269
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
Some searching you know again back-of-the-envelope kind of stuff here

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
A little disappointed that you didn't bust out any like books

271
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,407
I'm just looking up frisbee aerodynamic

272
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
She literally just turned a frisbee behavior on Earth

273
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
The spin of the Frisbee of course the lift

274
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Drag

275
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
But he looks all that stuff up

276
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
Assume that like aerodynamics on Mars

277
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
On Mars

278
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
Bear youth in the air there are so

279
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
Fitting lifting thing that you begin

280
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Frisbee

281
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Not have the same sort of

282
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,591
Hovering effect that a frisbee does here on Earth and it probably would be more like just

283
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Throwing up

284
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Ball it would just go

285
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,319
Ten feet away 15 feet away I don't think that that's that counts as a meaningful game of frisbee

286
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,951
People throw it back and forth but leaving.

287
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
You're playing frisbee

288
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
On Mars

289
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,631
I mean it's just that should be inherently meaningful

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
In a growing up I remember seeing

291
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
A rebroadcast

292
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Of

293
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,455
You know like the astronauts on the moon

294
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
Playing golf

295
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
And I'm sure that they were not playing like

296
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
You know PGA

297
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Gall

298
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,479
They were just you know amateur Duffer's but

299
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,087
They were golfing on the moon

300
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
I mean to me that's

301
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
Pretty good pretty impressive the venue

302
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Kind of

303
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:06,239
Makes the whole Endeavor meaningful I think in it and its way

304
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
Thanks to producer treatment

305
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
I asked you did ask them my dragons question

306
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Well then turn next up

307
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
Tracy Honda

308
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
And Dragons

309
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
Hey this is Christina Tracy High

310
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Just saying hey

311
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
This question is from Christina hard quiz

312
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,823
I'm a native of Novato at Northern California

313
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
And I was born and raised here

314
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Love this place

315
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,527
And you and what was your question to his if you remember what it was roughly

316
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Came across this

317
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Article about

318
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
These creatures

319
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Called ohms

320
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
That I guess we're being you know washed out of

321
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
These caves in Eastern Europe what are they called

322
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
These sort of like go online

323
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,983
Cave-dwelling amphibians there totally White

324
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,311
Skin is translucent very like otherworldly

325
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,639
The article touched on the idea that

326
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Ya folklore

327
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Thought that you

328
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Little Creatures were actually like

329
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
Dragon babies being twist

330
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Shout of

331
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
Of these caves where where these huge dragons live

332
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Spell

333
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
I started digging into it a little bit and of course you can only find so much on the internet but there was this idea of drag

334
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
Being assertive like a universal myth

335
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Across

336
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
You know different disparate cultures and

337
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
Christina started to wonder why it seemed that

338
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
So many cultures all over the world I'll have Miss

339
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
About dragon

340
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
What is it about like humans

341
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
About cause them to believe in these like huge

342
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
Scary fire breathing animals

343
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Set true that yeah.

344
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Sort out you had the northern European dragon that we're all familiar with then there's the Chinese

345
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,215
Dragon which is a little different that doesn't have wings doesn't breathe fire

346
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
Then there's other Dragon looking for two things the Nana Bolognese

347
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,015
Pool in southern Africa. There is the Amar associated with the Incan Empire yeah I think there's no doubt that

348
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
We have fabulous awesome

349
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Creatures like

350
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Dragons

351
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
In almost every culture

352
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
In the world

353
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
So this is Adrienne mayor research scholar in the classic

354
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
6 Department

355
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Stanford

356
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,399
And I'm most interested in is what sorts of things

357
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Found in nature

358
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Might have led pre-scientific

359
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
People

360
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
To believe that dragons or

361
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Monsters are there fantastic

362
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,919
The creatures really existed at least in the past or even maybe in

363
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Present

364
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Adrian actually got a book called the first fossil Hunters

365
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,367
That lays out the theory that a lot of these stories were actually based on

366
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
People finding old

367
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
Dino fossils and Bone fossil bones

368
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Are teeth or claws

369
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Footprints embedded in stone

370
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,935
So they see a set of old bones that they couldn't explain with any modern features

371
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
So the creature they go to is this

372
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Dragons

373
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Sheep thing

374
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Yes

375
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
But I do want to

376
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Queen Elsa

377
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
We can never know for certain which comes first.

378
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
Observations of

379
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Mystery is traces of

380
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
Of unknown animals or the stories of dragons we don't know which comes first she said it could be that the story about the Dragon

381
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
Ken was already there and then when they found some bones they just sort of apply those bones to the dragon f

382
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
If the dragon came before the bones where did it come from

383
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
There's another theory

384
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Some Scholars have said they're like

385
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
Monsters of the ear they arise from

386
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Ancient Memories

387
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
A very real predator

388
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
That were face

389
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
By our ancestors basically

390
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,575
Dragons are composite of the Seas creatures that used to eat us and in Huntington kill us like crocodiles

391
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
Saber tooth tigers and lions have bears

392
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Gigantic

393
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,743
Serpent snakes pythons Honda Raptors

394
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
They can take like this scaly skin of the crocodile the claws of the saber-tooth tiger in the seaport

395
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
He put the wing of the Raptors put them all together is all the old Terrors rolled into one like

396
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,639
Boom together

397
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Attack in to all those fears that are ready

398
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Cranberry inside

399
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
I'm going to go for that one

400
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,671
Yeah like that that works that that feels like an answer

401
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Scary that could be very destructive

402
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,047
What's kind of magical in in Game of Thrones

403
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
The intimate scenes

404
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Wholesale

405
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
Hard and bring you closer to these creatures that should be in a burning your face off

406
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
That she just used this whole Dragon thing to talk to

407
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
This lady at game from Game of Thrones

408
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Her name is Paula Fairfield and she makes all the dragon noises for Game of Thrones

409
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
Oh she makes the dragons what did you ask her I guess it was

410
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
What did you want to know

411
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
Well I wanted to know I like I wanted to know like how does she make

412
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,303
These

413
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,703
Sounds and it was really interesting cuz you know we're talking a little bit about you know how dragons are composite creatures

414
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,079
And she basically uses Composites to make these noises

415
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Absolutely take some places from

416
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Birds

417
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Ricci Chriqui bird sounds

418
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
In fact

419
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
Different kinds of reptilian recordings and stuff and key is it always scary animals

420
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:49,023
Dragon that sheet you know which of the Dragon said she's trying to actually create a performance Ford I have

421
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
Sounds I might choose simply by

422
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Certain personality traits that I might want

423
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Push forward

424
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,311
So in the case of drocon

425
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
So on the show there's the nearest

426
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
Dragon Queen and she has three dragons

427
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
And one of them is named Rogan

428
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
And she named

429
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
That dragon

430
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
After

431
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Khal Drogo

432
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Heard

433
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Hot late husband

434
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
So

435
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
Drogon is like her lover

436
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
He kind of has like a very affectionate

437
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Central relationship with her

438
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,016
He's whistling at her all the time he's looking at her butt and going oh baby

439
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
And so in order to kind of push for this sort of like

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Dragon sexual tension I guess

441
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
She uses the sounds of

442
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Two giant tortoises

443
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Animating

444
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Tortoises

445
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
It sound like

446
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Well

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
And I'm out to play it

448
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Wow

449
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,296
The grown of the mail actually became

450
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,672
With some working and you know just meant and stuff became I'm the source

451
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
The basis for

452
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Drogon spur with her

453
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Volaris

454
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
We need to respond

455
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
My people need me

456
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
The funny thing about the Pervert Rogan was watching people watch it and giggling when they heard it but not really knowing why

457
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
That's me and it's big

458
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Because it had

459
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,904
That ass instead that kind of sensual sexual Essence at / so yeah

460
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
All all kinds of things and

461
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
You know I also use

462
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
4

463
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Dragonfly wings

464
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
2

465
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,632
Make that kind of funny flutter of the

466
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Thorin sets

467
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Since moving like especially on the end of his tail this year

468
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
As you move through there was like a chitter

469
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
And that was like dragonfly wings

470
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Dragonfly wings

471
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Yeah

472
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,992
I I was wondering if you ever had a question about dragons that you would like to have answered

473
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
You don't know it says Cheerios

474
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
Because I think the thing that differentiates

475
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
It's the dragons

476
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
Preachers and makes them

477
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
Slightly I play

478
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Is the fire thing

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Where did the idea

480
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
That's a good question where did that come from

481
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
Well there many theories about

482
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
That actually I took that question back to a dreamer

483
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
The one that I like

484
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Is connected

485
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
To the devastating weapon called Greek Fire which was this unquenchable fire can't be put out by water

486
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Infected Burns and water

487
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
And so it was a Naval Weapon

488
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,576
And I believe that Scholars have found that

489
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Some of the nozzles for lasting Greek fire

490
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
4 shaped like dragon

491
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,608
So that the boat look like it had a dragon on board breathing fire at the enemy ships

492
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
So cool

493
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,960
They had dragons that breathe fire

494
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,544
I would make it back to to Northern Europe

495
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
That's the best theory I've heard

496
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
It's interesting

497
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,968
So it's like it's a drag it is a composite of all the things

498
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
Features of scared us

499
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
Now we're part of that composite I technology

500
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
That big dick

501
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
Is built becomes part of the creature that frightens us

502
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936

I'm a producer at Radiolab

526
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
And I'm here because I need your help

527
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
And I request

528
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

529
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

530
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Brilliant

531
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
Basically I want to hear about this

532
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
When a kid you know did something

533
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
It just means you lean back and say

534
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Well

535
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Maybe it was the moment that

536
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
A kid you've been reading to 4 months

537
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
Started reading back to you

538
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
Or maybe the kid was a piano

539
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,824
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

540
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Or maybe the kids in math

541
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Music in the margin of their geometry

542
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
We're interested in the

543
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Specific moments where

544
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
Kid does something super smart

545
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
It doesn't have anything to do with it

546
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928

Jad Robert Radiolab we are back

554
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
With more questions

555
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
Next one comes from

556
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Producer Rachel Cusack

557
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,280
So this question comes from Liam hamburger from Denver Colorado

558
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
I was browsing memes on my Instagram feed

559
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:23,264
The picture was trying to go to sleep

560
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,968
And the caption was her he's probably thinking about other girls and then

561
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
What do you say wonder what

562
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,160
Yeah so he said I wonder if I've ever bought milk from the same cow twice

563
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,048
So if I go to the store I bought a gallon of milk and then I go back maybe a week later I got another gallon of milk

564
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,400
What are the odds that the same towel is in both of those gallons of milk

565
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
I would say

566
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
The answer is almost

567
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
Certainly

568
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
100%

569
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
Start Benjamin he's a math professor Harvey Mudd College

570
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Claremont California

571
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
And I'm also a nap emoji

572
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
And how is he so sure that it's 100% according to Benjamin it all comes down to

573
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
And dare I say

574
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Calculator

575
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
So take a farm like Dale's here

576
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
My name is Dale

577
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,496
Pine Hollow Dairy Dale has about a thousand cows

578
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
And 22 time you cows walk into a milking parlor they lineup it looks like a wishbone all day all night

579
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,272
And they get hooked up with these black rubber hoses are your here and there is a guy putting them

580
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Machine on a cow and he hits the

581
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
Button that turns on the vacuum and then

582
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Out of there others

583
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
Into the big hose along the bottom of the floor

584
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Run to the house

585
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,352
And it's meeting up with all the milk from all the other cows

586
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Domenico's

587
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
From that room into another room or get cool down

588
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
Very cool down it goes into this rocket ship looking thing outside called a milk Silo where all the milk from Del's Farm

589
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Image of hanging out together

590
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
Until it's full

591
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Sending out

592
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,184
Over 8000 gallons of milk today on a

593
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Tractor trailer

594
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:23,072
Amazon picks up milk and it stops at another Farm in another Farm in another Farm until

595
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
The truck is full

596
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Full list of the processing plant

597
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,288
And once the processing plant all that milk is just mixed around even more with milk from all the cows Muresan

598
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
And I still have my

599
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,248
My back-of-the-envelope that have the

600
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,600
Calculation here here's with my something there are about 90000

601
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Drops of milk

602
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
In a gallon

603
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,488
I don't know a hundred thousand

604
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Contributing

605
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,072
Tempura chicken processing plant

606
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
A drop of milk

607
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,448
From anyone tile getting into any particular gallon but probably the case

608
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
Gallon of milk

609
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Contains

610
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Most of those cows

611
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
Contributing nothing in one drop of milk you could probably have a bunch of different milk molecules from a bunch of different

612
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
And so one glass of milk

613
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Might have

614
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
Maybe hundreds of thousands of different

615
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
County Public Schools

616
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
In my glass

617
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Wow

618
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:29,376
I'm going back to the original question Arts argument is that

619
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,008
When you're drinking a glass of milk there's like so many different bits of milk from so many different cows

620
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Then it's probably the case

621
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Two glasses

622
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Look now. You're almost certain to

623
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
A cow that was rapped

624
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,296
So you're bound to run into at least a little bit of one of those hundred thousand cows

625
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,112
Again there's no point being that every glass of milk

626
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
Thousands and thousands of different cows

627
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,328
Contributing to it a little bit of 10000 cows in every class in every glass of milk

628
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:05,728
I love that I don't know that I know it's great it's like you're enjoying the collective efforts of this entire species

629
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,872
Oh no I think it should be the product of one or two cows when you can picture in your head and maybe pat on the nose

630
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Thank you you could say

631
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
Yeah I know I'm with both of you I feel like

632
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,344
It weirds me out but I also think it's kind of cool at the same time what happens if you drink a glass of milk

633
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
In New York

634
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Get on a plane flight to Atlanta

635
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,560
Then have another glass of milk are you getting the same 10,000 in each class or are they different 10,000

636
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,632
Answer that question and it seems like no one really wants

637
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
To pay to ship milk that far

638
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,776
And so basically it done processing plant might be in a whole different group

639
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
If you really want to figure out exactly which plant your milk is coming from you can go to where is my milk from.com

640
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Yeah and

641
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
You input a little code on the top of your carton

642
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,672
And see how often that number comes up again each processing plant has its own code

643
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Show many stores

644
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Thank you just a big thanks to Dairy Farmer jail Mattoon over at Pine Hollow Dairy

645
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
Oh yeah

646
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
Glass or two for lunch and a glass or two for dinner probably two glasses each each meal if I don't

647
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Drink milk I don't feel good

648
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040

I have you on speaker phone and back is right here how's it going

655
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,224
So Zach Murray it was years ago actually they sent us an email

656
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
But what I think is like one of the most confounding perplexing mysterious devices

657
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,136
He can find inside anybody's home peso the microwave

658
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
I guess I guess what I'm wondering is

659
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,536
1 why were you microwaving peppers in too deep

660
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,584
GMM of this happen

661
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
What happened

662
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,704
Petzl quick scene setup Portland Maine

663
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472

Shortcut for something

666
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,016
And I said oh. Don't put those in the microwave

667
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
And I was just like

668
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
You're crazy

669
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,488
Hogwash

670
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
Mom put some peppers in the microwave in a spark

671
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
My first thought was that he was wrong that's what I thought I bet your memory was like there must have been a piece of metal in them

672
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:22,336
Nike wavys don't remember that and that's what was barking up cuz special I wouldn't do that

673
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,176
Nothing until

674
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
We have the ability to find this out

675
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
And I approve that's wrong

676
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
So that was like five years ago in the past so we decided we would actually do

677
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Our own experiment

678
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
The present

679
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
To get to the bottom of this

680
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
Do green peppers

681
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,424
Spark in the microwave first thing first I shouldn't bottom microwave

682
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
How's it going fifty bucks

683
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Alright alright baby

684
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
And carried it like

685
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
8 blocks back to work

686
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,344
Also bought a bunch of groceries because we're going to do more than just a Peppers test and 4 reasons

687
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,928
I'd rather not get into a decided not to start with the peppers

Set it

695
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
And forget

696
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,720
This little yellow spot just shot out from one of her slaves

697
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280

See who needs fireworks when you got it

718
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,328
Yeah cuz I don't want it yet is it going to look like who's on fire

719
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
Play Bad

720
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Take a break

721
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
What did you say to Maria after the

722
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Peppers

723
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Spark in microwave

724
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,344
I think I would I don't know I was totally speechless

725
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
So pepper spark in microwave that was settled but

726
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,728
The debate about my understanding of how microwaves work

727
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Why

728
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,568
Maybe it's just that ever have a lot of moisture in it

729
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,384
Zach maybe it's you put the pepper in microwave all that water get

730
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,784
Skin act as like Tinder and that lights on fire quickly

731
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
And I think that the green one

732
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Taste a little bit

733
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
Little bit of metal in there that Sparky

734
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Is your next step to

735
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,912
Find the appropriate scientist oh yeah I'm definitely going to try it

736
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
Put this case to bed

737
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Yeah just give us one moment

738
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,128
So ended up tracking down this woman is Caroline Caroline

739
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Okay

740
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Carolina Ross

741
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,040
Summer professor in the department of Materials Science and Engineering in MIT and experience

742
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Microwave a donut with some

743
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
With roast potatoes

744
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Yeah I've seen Sparks most potatoes

745
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Alright so yeah

746
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
So Astrid in the case of

747
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
The peppers

748
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
Potatoes or

749
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Are the grapes like all the different food that we tried

750
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Like what happens in a microwave

751
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
The food just relay

752
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
So they got some pieces of paper in the microwave

753
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Press start

754
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Like what

755
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
What happened

756
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Okay

757
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
So that was a

758
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
Gadgets in the microwave oven that produces the microwaves it's called a magnet phone and it's an interesting

759
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Thing in itself

760
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:29,792
Okay quicksand it's basically like this hunk of metal that makes microwaves but Kailyn told me it's really cool thing which is

761
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,912
If she's be used in World War 4 radar that was in the forties and then

762
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:40,544
In 1945 there was an engineer Raytheon who was working on these devices

763
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,384
And he found that some candy ball he had in his pocket got hot

764
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,992
Like this Cooks food until then SLI magnetron got thrown inside of a mailbox

765
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Indus was born

766
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
The microwave so it's an interesting thing in itself but

767
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,416
It produces a beam of microwaves and they

768
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,256
Bounce Around inside the microwave oven moving at the speed of light

769
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
What is pounding

770
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
Into the pepper

771
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Like shooting independent episode

772
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
And these microwaves

773
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,384
They are the right kind of frequency to cause the molecules in food to oscillate back and forth

774
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
You put the pepper in that so

775
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
The purpose of lots of water inlet Esquivel the things as well

776
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
And

777
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Those molecules stops absorbing the microwaves and bouncing back and forth and

778
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,464
Hitting each other and heating up

779
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,536
And then that fit gets even home satin even horse app

780
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Eventually

781
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
It could burst into flames

782
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
But that is not

783
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
What we're seeing

784
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
With our pepperoni

785
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
It's not no because

786
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Is Caroline

787
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
Find me a flame is very different

788
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
I got a spark

789
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
So one thing to keep in mind just that some

790
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
The pepper is fairly conductive it's go to all this water and that we know that water can conduct electricity

791
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,648
Computer has a lot of salt dissolved in it

792
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
Minerals things like that in that sense it's a little bit like a piece of metal metal as we know so

793
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Microwave energy Roswell as we all know

794
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
Yes

795
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,848
30 Gatti's pizza pepperoni microwave in there

796
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,736
Another thing is the microwave like the wave itself it has an electric field

797
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,600
Which house lights back and forth high frequency

798
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Shoot in a piece of paper what happened is

799
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Is electricity starts

800
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
Switching back and forth to Pepper on flowing

801
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,448
You can get quite big concert Electric

802
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,848
Yield around the food and that's electric field bills off enough enough and eventually it's big enough to

803
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Close the app

804
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
To Glow

805
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Around the food

806
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,807
Actually electricity coursing through

807
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,111
The air like a fluorescent light bulb

808
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
You can start to see these glowing balls of gas

809
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Floating

810
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
Text you the air turning into plasma

811
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,399
Now back in the center the microwave

812
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
RR little bit

813
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Pepper Wethersfield

814
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
Electrical current switching back and forth through those bits

815
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
Peppa and

816
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,407
If you have sharp corners

817
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
Tiny microscopic little points

818
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
Electricity electricity are concentrated at those Shopko nose like a lightning rod

819
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
NFL Corners electricity

820
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Bill

821
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Build

822
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Build

823
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Until

824
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
You got some mini lightning bolts

825
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
McAllen said everything in the microwave disorder

826
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Calm down

827
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,615
Until the electric field builds up again and it doesn't roll over letting loose these mini lightning bolts

828
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:00,479
Does a very Dynamic process you've got things being honest you've got things recombining

829
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,807
You've got charged flowing you've got light being emitted

830
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Things get hot

831
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,671
There's a big current flowing over that tiny fraction of a second

832
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
Lots of quantum physics in there

833
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
And then we hear a little thing

834
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
And then

835
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
With them

836
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Then we're done

837
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Nice job to do

838
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
How you doing

839
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Okay

840
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:31,455
Call Zach Murray told everything I learned about there's parking pepper and that even though both of them didn't have you text Siri like sack was right

841
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,551
Waters important part of Marie was onto something with this metal thing

842
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
It feels like it's almost like a little bit of like a marriage

843
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,207
Start pardon the pun between both your idea is that

844
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
What is what is happening inside this

845
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Black Box

846
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
So yeah

847
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
We have some some of the elements there

848
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
Yeah

849
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
It said it's about it

850
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
There was one

851
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
Thing that I ask all these questions

852
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
We are getting in

853
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,623
There was like this tiny little pattern of of married couples spending us in

854
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
There was one couple that was like

855
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
They're arguing about

856
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,399
The nutritional value of microwaving a potato another very

857
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,495
Long email about how they've been debating about how we perceive

858
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
Color

859
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Actually had a similar to

860
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
Yes it does

861
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Oh yeah

862
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,551
Sort of like

863
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Tone that I thought was

864
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,695
Lean and you thought was brown gray

865
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Yeah we have that couch for like

866
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
Between different houses in different

867
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,631
Probably like 5 or 6 years and maybe 7 years 10 years

868
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
And I

869
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,055
And I was yeah I always thought it was gray and still do but apparently you and your sister thought it was Green

870
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
You like them together for years and you never realized

871
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,967
You're saying something completely different

872
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
You don't have a green couch

873
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Producer Matt kielty

874
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:31,263
All right so that's just a few of the questions you asked us which we tried to answer

875
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
But that's just the first part of our effort we have another whole sequence of questions and answers coming up so

876
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,735
If your question hasn't been answered yet

877
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,831
Never know the next batch never there now question it's coming very

878
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
Very soon

879
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
