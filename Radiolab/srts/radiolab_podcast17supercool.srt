1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

Approaching things are kind of heavy right now could use a little lightning

10
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
This begins with

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
A very very

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Successful

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,712
A film editor with what you'll you'll meet him in the moment

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,064
A comes to us with an idea which Chad loves I hate and things go from there

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
Perfect

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,904
Hello hello

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Starts with Walt

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:06,816
Walter murch, film editor and sound designer and I've been working in film since

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
The late 1960s

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Resume includes

21
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
I want to make an offer

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
The Godfather

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,288
Apocalypse Now

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Carnival

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Don't see think we're talkin about

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Is the

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
One of the more spectacular stories I've ever

28
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
How do you

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Bump into this

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Well I was in

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Leon

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
In France

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Doing a film

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
Unbearable lightness of being

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
Is back in 1986

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
I was supposed to be there for a week and it wound up

37
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
Why was there for a month

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,704
But ran out of things to read so I went down the street from the hotel on

39
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
There was a bookstore

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,408
I was interested and still am in cosmology so I picked up a book by the

41
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Carl Sagan

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
French

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
My name is Hubert Reeves

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
You better

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
You better actually is French Canadian

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
You translate to stop signal

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
Merchants up buying Reeves book ghost

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
The hotel

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,072
Because he's happily reading away and he was trying to explain

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
With some

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Difficulty because it's a difficult

52
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Topic

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
How did

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
Matter condensed

55
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Out of the sort of

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Pork soup

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
But we believe happened right after the big bang

58
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
And he tried various

59
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Temperature

60
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
Scientifically but then he said

61
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
To give you a sense of

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
The Poetry of this moment

63
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
The best

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
Thing is the story that malaparte tells

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Who is malaparte

66
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Well

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
He was a journalist

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Poets

69
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Diplomat

70
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Soldier

71
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Prisoner film director

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
And somebody who

73
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
Got around and speaking of getting around in 1942 a

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Milanese newspaper

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Centinela Park

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
To report

77
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
On the eastern and Northern front

78
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
So the war

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,280
Specifically the Russian Finnish border you had a front-row seat of the siege of Leningrad

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
The agony of the Nazi bombardment of that City and its from there

81
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
In Menlo Park

82
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
So this

83
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
1

84
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Day

85
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
This wasn't in the winter

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,896
Malaparte was posted with a Finnish Army who were fighting along with the Nazis

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712
And they were perched just north of vinegar

88
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
On the shores of Lake ladoga which is this big

89
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Lake

90
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
About in the city

91
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
And on this day

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
The Nazis bombarded.

93
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
The start of the forest fire everyone ran for cover

94
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Soldiers ran Every Witch Way and in the middle of the forest there were Soviet forces that were locked up in a stable

95
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,920
And the horses

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
And broke out at the Stables hundreds of them and they just started running to get away from the

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Do you have hundreds of horses vaulting through this flaming Forest heading towards the open space I had

98
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,095
Which was the lake once they first out of the forest and go barreling into Lake

99
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
Stampeding one on top of the other

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
If y'all get deeper and deeper

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,919
In the blink of an eye

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Snap some shots

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
It just freezes

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Suddenly turns to ice with a bang

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
It goes from water to ice with this violence

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Snap

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
And suddenly the horses are in 2

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Malaparte right cities in the waves on the Lake Weir gripped in midair and sort of suspend

109
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Fade Out

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
The next morning when malaparte in the fins

111
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
Woke up and discovered the forest fire had burned itself out

112
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
And look at that the lake has frozen solid overnight

113
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
And his finished friends said yes that's sometimes

114
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
They look and see what are those bumps on the ice over there

115
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
They go to investigate and they find themselves in this

116
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Horrific sculpture garden of

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Horses heads

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
Sticking up out of the solid marble like

119
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
4 of ice

120
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
He said hundreds of hundreds of Horseheads leaderboard

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
These are these are not going to Decay right cuz it's freezing cold so they will be those horses stay there all

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Winter

123
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
Malaparte was there in that

124
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
Region of the world during that winter and every so often he and the other soldiers

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Go and have a smoke

126
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Letgo

127
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
Into the sculpture garden and

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
Wander around looking at this miraculous

129
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
To this image of the horses Frozen in this Lake beautiful and strange and disturbing

130
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
Profound in some way

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Latest Wonder

132
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
I told you I just don't trust this story it's not a scientific Lee impossible and I

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Keeping an open heart

134
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
You got it would this possibly be

135
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
Could there be a grain perhaps several grain perhaps a Lakes worth of grains of Truth

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
Just your mind is like loose like a

137
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Anyway

138
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,335
This year

139
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
We can strike that argument right now and take this up town

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
Alright let's do this

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Doctor's review sites

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Floors of argument

143
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
We ended up going uptown to Rockefeller University

144
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
Medical people who know about I so we're going to go play with some super cool ice

145
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Magnum

146
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
This fellow

147
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
I'm Alexander Petrov in the Raymond and Beverly Sackler felco

148
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:11,615
They occasionally almost show up and I almost meet them but I never have yeah

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
By the way the Sackler family

150
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
Recently come into a bit of controversy

151
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
We all know that now

152
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
We didn't it

153
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Daleks you must be said isn't amazing dude

154
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,463
Graciously agreed to demonstrate that you can in fact

155
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Create the conditions of that massive Lake

156
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
Inside a tiny little stupid

157
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
Destructive Falcon Falcon tube

158
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
The plastic tube filled with water

159
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
This is not normal water this is the really nice water it's very very

160
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,247
Pure water no minerals no Destiny like super distilled and he says when you take water like that and you cool it down

161
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,343
You can get it far below its freezing point and it won't freeze

162
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Unless that is

163
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Yeah but

164
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
You have a tiny horse here

165
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
We have a tiny

166
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
And we are going to drop that into the Falcon tube and do that

167
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
That's going to be awesome so we handed us

168
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:12,799
The tube I'm holding a little vial of supercooled water with it Alex what temperature do you think

169
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
This is mine this is mine

170
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
C Celsius

171
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
When does water freezes at 0

172
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,831
20 degrees below freezing point at Stillwater but not for long

173
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
Unscrewed the cap are you are you filming

174
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
We held the little plastic horse over the tube

175
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Count down or something

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Okay on the count of three guilty

177
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
At 3

178
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
2 1

179
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
Because the moment that little plastic horse hit the water the water slammed into ice

180
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Selling that little guy was trapped

181
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
In a nice guy

182
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Oh my God is Thor's is Frozen

183
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
Please remember the horse was plastic no animals were harmed in this experiment

184
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
It is honestly breathtaking

185
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
But it happens

186
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Selfie

187
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Catastrophic ice formation

188
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Just like that

189
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
You're the seaward Robert say it again

190
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Catastrophic

191
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
This is Virginia Walker

192
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
Andaman the department of biology Queens University

193
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Virginia was one of the many people that we called up to

194
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
To ask

195
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
What the hell like why does this happen

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Action this water just freeze gradually the way that

197
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Water does you know what 32 degrees Fahrenheit

198
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Whatever new

199
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
So you see this

200
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
That's why we have to stop at the beginning as Julie Andrews said

201
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
A very good place

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Start right

203
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
All right

204
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,983
So the only reason that water freezes normally at zero

205
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Celsius

206
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
32 Fahrenheit

207
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Is that the something they have that makes

208
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Freeze we Colette and UK later

209
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Sounds like a superhero

210
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Yeah I'm alright

211
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Citizen ukulele

212
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
A nucleator is like

213
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Accede

214
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Right

215
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Didn't know this but it turns out

216
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Water almost always needs a seed

217
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
In order to grow ice

218
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
It turns out water by itself is not actually

219
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
That good at remembering how to become ice

220
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
That is Erin Pettit

221
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
She's a glaciologist

222
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
At the University of Alaska Fairbanks and which of these is it when water cools down the molecule start to slow their movement

223
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
A little bit closer together that point they want all hold hands and become I set the water molecules don't quite remember

224
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Very well

225
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
How they're supposed to be organized

226
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,671
Bill equate do you stand here and I stand here how do we do this again

227
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
They need to be shown what combination of angles work the best to create a nice day

228
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Table

229
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
Structure what they need is a speck of dust that's the nucleus

230
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
He throwing some dust and to otherwise pure water now they have a guy

231
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,895
Because I scan start to mimic whatever the the the shape of the Dust particle is

232
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,015
What happens if the water molecule start to form a cage around the dust particle in that case shape

233
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Is very similar to the shape they need

234
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
To make ice

235
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
Something that I like that's how we do it

236
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
Sooner sense the dust particle is reminding the water molecules

237
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
How to freeze

238
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
No I do

239
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Think of it like that

240
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Bridget says it's actually not quite so

241
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
So gentle really what's happening is the dust particle is

242
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,591
Forcing the water molecules into the right shape around it

243
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
It's like a it's like a command

244
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Nothing about memory is its

245
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
It's a physical thing

246
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
They just got jammed in there

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,439
Started

248
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Dog ate so if

249
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
As we just learned water needs

250
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
The catalyst nucleator

251
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
In order to

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Fries

253
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,935
Doesn't least raise the possibility that that

254
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Finnish Russian Lake

255
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
And reached

256
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Supercooled state

257
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
Along come these horses and they

258
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
Where the nucleator maybe they had dust on their hair

259
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Or whatever I don't know

260
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Whatever it was it started a chain reaction

261
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Ice

262
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
Spread outward from these horses shot across the entire leg

263
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
And froze the whole damn thing

264
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Once

265
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,887
An actual excuse me for just a second because this is like at reading like in post I have

266
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,103
We're going to take a break and we'll continue this

267
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Meaningless tussle in just moments

268
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,063
This is Alicia Bridges going from Saskatoon in Saskatchewan Radiolab is supported in part by the

269
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Alfred P Sloan Foundation

270
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,695
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

271
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
More information about Sloane @www.

272

Flooring.org

273
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

274
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,055
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

275
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

276
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

277
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Williams

278
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,415
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

279
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
It just means you lean back and say whoa

280
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
How do they do that

281
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,143
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

282
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

283
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,919
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

284
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
We're interested in the

285
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Specific moments where

286
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,855
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

287
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
If you have a story

288
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,279
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message

289
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
And that's where you're at. Org / brilliance

290
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Thank you so much

291
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
Okay so big Jad Robert Radiolab before the break

292
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
We posited what I thought was an interesting Theory robber

293
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
Not buying it now get to your skepticism I want to talk

294
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
A little bit more

295
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
About nucleator

296
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Because when we were talking with Virginia

297
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Tell us something kind of cool

298
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Astrolabe

299
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
What else

300
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Nucleotide

301
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
We learn about Josh but what else can do

302
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Okay

303
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
So

304
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
The best nucleator

305
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Is ice

306
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,687
So just have a little bit of snow falls into some water or a little bit ice

307
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Forms in the water organically

308
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,575
The water molecules will rush around that and Bam if you don't have ice

309
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
What is the second best thing

310
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Tenor ukulele size

311
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Happens to be bacteria

312
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
She says there aren't

313
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Three different kinds of bacteria

314
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
They can generate these

315
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,471
Special protein big hunk and protein that can instantly turn water into ice

316
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,567
In fact we were reporting the story of video started circulating on the internet

317
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,943
It showed a scientist taking a bottle of water squirting out a little bit of this bacteria in a minute

318
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Nothing just shot in dice

319
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
And that

320
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Cool thing is

321
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
These bacteria are actually Plum pathogen

322
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Plant killer

323
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
So you've probably seen bras

324
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
Growing in your backyard or whatever and it can be all covered with frost

325
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
But then you know the frosting melt and it's still green

326
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
But if those bacteria present

327
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
She says they'll spit out their proteins

328
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Under the plant

329
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
Generate seed ice crystals

330
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Ice crystals

331
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Then slice the plan open and

332
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,455
Expose the inside of the plant at the bacteria site yummy

333
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,039
His lunch and the eat the eat the inside of the

334
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Good strategy

335
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
That's not the cool part

336
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
Regina said she is also found these proteins

337
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Bacteria that don't

338
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
So that made me think

339
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Mater wonder why

340
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
Why would they need to me

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
And that's when it

342
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
It occurred to her and a few other

343
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Maybe it's about

344
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Transportation

345
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Exactly where

346
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Nothing about these bacteria just sitting on these play

347
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
And what happens is the wind comes along

348
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,759
Blues up this little bacteria into the upper atmosphere

349
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Blows them literally up into the cloud

350
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Did not particularly cold hardy

351
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Situation

352
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
Do you not want to be all the way up there

353
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
They got to get back down to the Earth

354
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,839
And unless I hit you right on those horses that you keep talking about

355
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
This a light

356
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
They might not come down to us

357
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,775
So what day do Shih Tzus back since they use the plant trick they spit out these proteins

358
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:49,151
Into the cold wet Cloud which galvanizes the water molecules around them

359
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
The Forum

360
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Snowflake

361
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Around their body

362
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
So now they got this little hovercraft

363
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
They can use to

364
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Post on down

365
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,071
With they make ice they can get back down and they can get back down into different place

366
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
And start a new colony of bacteria somewhere else

367
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,983
And so but this way they get dispersed around the whole us

368
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Think about that

369
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
The next time it's winter

370
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
It snows

371
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Apparently

372
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
If you melt

373
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Each snowflake

374
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
You'll find a little bacterium inside

375
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
You're saying all of them

376
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
I haven't looked at

377
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Every single

378
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Snowflake

379
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
But it makes perfect sense doesn't it

380
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
That's a bit that's a very very cool idea

381
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
I suddenly like the bacteria movie

382
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Helluva lot better

383
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
The horse movie

384
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Solis

385
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,447
At least as a shot of being true

386
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Yeah

387
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
The horses

388
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
So when we were reporting this story.

389
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
Darren Pettit in Virginia walker and a bunch of other

390
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
We asked

391
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Could entire leg

392
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Flash frozen in an instant

393
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Trappin all those horses

394
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,999
Uniformly the answer that we got was no

395
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,631
Did you hear her know there did you hear the sound of it

396
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
Can you say absolutely not or is it just a kind of gentle no

397
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
I'd say that's an absolutely not

398
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,383
Because Aaron told this when you're talking about freezing and it's

399
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Prior Lake

400
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
Will you got a lot of problems to consider first

401
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Process of

402
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Freezing

403
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Actually is a source of heat

404
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,647
Itself because like when water molecules form bonds to make ice

405
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
That's a lot of activity

406
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
The inactivity producer

407
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Energy and now

408
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,119
That's going to make things a little bit warmer not to mention the fact that horses are warm-blooded animals

409
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
But they also would slow down the process

410
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,799
Also the water would never have been pure enough to super glue in the first place because I

411
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
There's too many things in the lake that would

412
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,223
Provide that initial nucleation plants organisms dirt

413
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,319
Did somebody actually see this what is the actual evidence that

414
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
No

415
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,951
Nobody saw any of this as it actually happened

416
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
When we told Walter Marsh with the scientist

417
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
In typical Baltimore fashion he was

418
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Iseecars

419
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,495
Reminded us that he never told us it was true that malaparte often mixed fact in

420
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
Addiction and a theory real reason he's attracted

421
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
The story

422
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,943
Because it offered a metaphor for cosmology the beginning of the universe

423
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Really

424
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
I mean

425
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
If you'll excuse me for a small bit of skepticism is true for the universe metaphor metaphor

426
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,511
Even so you mean here's what I mean

427
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
And if you're a physicist listening right now just turn off

428
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,311
So you can think of it in one of two ways right the first is that idea of super Cooling

429
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Wechat Rockefeller where

430
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,455
Under the right circumstances water can cool down way below its freezing point

431
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Not freeze

432
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
And then all of a sudden

433
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
Innokin suddenly do that

434
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
What you thought Rockefeller in the test

435
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
According to Jan 11

436
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Professor of physics

437
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Barnard College

438
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Colombia universe

439
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
And therefore holds because

440
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:27,263
That Bizarro flash freezing phenomenon actually happen repeatedly

441
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
She says in the moments after the big bang

442
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Yes

443
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,919
Supercooling is definitely something that happens in the early yunnan

444
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
She says right when the universe got its start

445
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
Still small like a size of a grapefruit

446
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
Inside the grapefruit is extremely hot back then it was probably a million billion trillion

447
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Million times hotter

448
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,631
A million trillion trillion trillion times 32 times hotter

449
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Bedazzled grapefruit began to expand the temperature started to drop and it dropped and dropped to a point where

450
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Universe should free

451
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
To speak but it didn't

452
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,783
It's waiting is waiting for you and you're like what's happening why aren't you freezing then suddenly

453
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Exchange

454
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
The guide

455
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,440
Okay I don't know exactly what you're saying we keep going a lot of phase changes some of them

456
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Super cool don't worry

457
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Okay

458
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
There's another parallel which I think is actually even more

459
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Has to do with those seeds

460
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Do we talked about

461
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
If you go back to the Grave

462
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
Okay inside

463
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
It's very hot you got this wash of energy in this energy

464
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Is

465
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Uniform

466
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,456
Write all the same thing

467
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Spread evenly

468
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Everywhere the same

469
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
Dentist in school you begin to get these

470
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Tiny

471
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Punctuation variations

472
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Temperature

473
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
Density for the little bit hotter and denser in one point

474
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Then another we're talkin about clumps

475
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,960
Like maybe were here is a little bit more matter and heat than over there

476
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
And bees rrc

477
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,896
I don't think that you're describing seed like I understand see Caesar Little Things

478
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Things that attract others

479
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
Behave just like seeds

480
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,648
Because as the universe cooled down and expands and begin to add all these new forces and all these new particles

481
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Gravity electron

482
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
John Adams

483
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
Those little bits of variation from the beginning or still there

484
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
And now they're growing bigger

485
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Now we have gravity

486
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
Writes a little concentrations of stuff are now attracting more stuff

487
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
More stuff in the more stuff in as Universe expands they expand until ultimately those little blips have

488
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,688
Massive objects amazingly the largest

489
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,784
Structures that we know about in the universe have their seeds in these tiny f****

490
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Does that mean when you go

491
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
On a

492
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
On a star

493
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Worst

494
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
Kind of voice you and your spaceship in your going out

495
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Some incredibly

496
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
Rushing through the universe

497
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
And you see

498
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Huge clouds

499
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Gas with

500
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Nurseries for

501
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Stars and you leave them and you go to a Galaxy and then another galaxy that has got to be here any Galaxy over there and what you hear

502
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,432
You're saying these massive structures

503
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Walls of galaxies

504
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Neighborhood

505
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Stardust

506
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
AR

507
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
Reflections of a very

508
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
Early moments

509
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Something went

510
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
In the initial broilers

511
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
This beautiful structures that you're describing are like the snowflakes around a little bit ago

512
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,800
What is that mean that the empty spaces that we see when we gaze at the

513
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Current universe

514
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Are actually filled with something that hasn't

515
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Cool yet or that his

516
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,552
What are is invisible to us or is working under different rules

517
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
I can say we might not have seen the last of the basement

518
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
Our universe is absolutely continuing to cool

519
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Is it really yeah

520
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
It's very cold right now

521
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
We have this

522
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,864
Dark Energy driving the universe

523
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
2 expanded a never accelerated rate and it's conceivable that in the future that energy won't do or some phase transition

524
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,616
And it will go away or or Decay to something else

525
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
And this new state of matter

526
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
It might do something different to the evolution of

527
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
So we might have a phase transition in our future

528
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Suddenly in a

529
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
Oldies

530
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,664
We have many people to thank who helped us on this particular podcast totally

Translate

540
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Russian and finish book

541
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,128
Oh and last but not least Walter murch

542
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
My hero

Jaguar

544
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
I love you

545
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
And more importantly he released

546
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
A book

547
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Translating malaparte from

548
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Italian

549
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
English

550
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
Which is where we got

551
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
The story

552
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Of that

553
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Dove the horse

554
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
It's called the bird

555
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Swallowed it

556
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
