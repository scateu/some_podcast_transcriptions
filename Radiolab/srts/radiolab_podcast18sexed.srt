1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,840
Before we get started just to note

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
This episode contains some strong language

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,264
As well as content that may not be suitable or at least ready

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
For younger years

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
It is an episode about

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Sex ed

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Okay thanks

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Ouat

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,088
Northern listening to Radiolab

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:30,208
Radio WNYC

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
Hey I Molly Webster

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
This is gonads episode 6

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
And it's our last episode

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,104
I'm going to go cry after this is done but first

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
I want to share with you this really

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,296
Fun thing that team gonads did in May

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,648
And that is we did a live event on sex ed

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
You know if you've been listening to this series we have been looking at the biology of biological sex and sex tutor

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Termination

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
And one of the things he kept thinking was like

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Pan

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,032
Now that we know how complicated it is like how do we teach this stuff

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
And how do we teach this

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Staff

25
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
In a climate where

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
People are really polarized and divided

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
And thinking about all this

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Text said it just felt like more than radio story you know if you bring up sex ad with anybody they have store

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
No worries they get excited they get animated

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,072
It really felt like something that would live quite beautifully in a live

31
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Space in a live event you know almost like a recreate the sex-ed classes we all may or may not

32
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Have gone through

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,592
So today we'll be bringing you clips of that show and it starts

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Which atom rod

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Hello hello how are you guys doing

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
All right

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
So so so excited you were here so

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
I guess I should just say welcome to Radiolab sex ed

39
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,512
That is a sentence I never thought I would say

40
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,912
In the 15 years I've been doing the show I never anticipated this moment where I be on stage

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Thing that you alive

42
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Group of humans

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
But you know here we are

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
So I actually didn't have sex ed

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,200
So I am looking forward to learning something tonight

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Please welcome to the stage Radiolab Molly Webster

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Hello hello hello hello

48
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
Well this kind of feels like my sex ed class which was like

49
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
Like nerve-racking and you're not sure how it's going to go

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
So to start the night

51
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
We are going to go down South

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Mississippi

53
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
2011

54
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
The state

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Passes a law that places some

56
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Restrictions on sex set

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
Notably when it comes to talking about

58
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Condoms

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
The Lofts

60
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
No instruction or demonstration on that

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
So that's

62
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Sanford Johnson he is a sex educator in Mississippi

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
And so on the one hand you might think

64
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
No big deal right

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Plastic kids can figure out how use it we don't know

66
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Map to show them everything

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
Sanford says

68
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
It's not really that easy

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
I will tell you a story when I was a high school

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
Teacher

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Delta

72
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Because I'm

73
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
The school brought in

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
A guest

75
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
Certified sex educator to talk to the kids about sex

76
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
It is stuck with me

77
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Reset when you make cock

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Make a call

79
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
In the time it takes you to drive

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Store

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Really said that

82
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
In the time it takes you to driver

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Store

84
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
To your house

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Aluminum 1/2

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,536
And every time it takes you to take it out of the wrapper and

87
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Put it all

88
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Illuminati

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,423
And I was thinking that's how fast work

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
Does Sanford and all of his teacher friends were like well if this is what kids are being told maybe we really do need to

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
To do this kind of damage

92
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Castration

93
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
But the question is

94
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
How

95
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Surfer stand for this all came to a head

96
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Teacher training

97
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
He was at so the teacher training was to

98
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Train teachers

99
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
And how to

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Teach sex ed

101
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
And is part of the training

102
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,863
One of the teachers was like up in front of the group and she was supposed to explain

103
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
How to use a condo

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Because this is the caveat in the law

105
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
You can talk about a condom

106
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
You can explain or like a show

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
How to use one

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Answer this teacher

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
So as she talks

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
An SUV

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
You couldn't help but ask

112
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Panama

113
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Somebody from the state park

114
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
I don't think

115
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
To do that I really don't

116
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Talking with your hands

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Was now illegal

118
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
And I got that

119
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
NSC

120
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
And

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
So we thought

122
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
It's hilarious yes but it's also like

123
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
You need to tell me

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
The kids about condoms we don't really know how to do it

125
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
And just thinking about this the next

126
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
Gay Sanford came up with something

127
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
That

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
I think might be one of my most favorite things on the internet

129
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,143
Right now

130
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
In the shadows

131
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
IPhone video in which Sanford Johnson standing there

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
I was 1 foot bear

133
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
While

134
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
He's holding a white tube socks

135
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
And a sneaker

136
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
And remember

137
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
According to Missy

138
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Mississippi law

139
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
He's not allowed to

140
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Perform an act

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
What kind of damage

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Castration

143
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
With a condo

144
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
So what he does he holds

145
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Does tube socks with Cameron

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
He says

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
I want to make sure that you come out

148
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
Cuz I want to make sure there's room for my television

149
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
When am I

150
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
And all I do is your problem now

151
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423
If you want to roll it

152
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,551
This video lives on our website and you should absolutely go watch it when you're done with this episode

153
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,719
This video is delightful but it served a larger purpose for us which is that it reminded us

154
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
There are a lot of different ways to have conversations about sex

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
And the body

156
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
And we thought okay

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
What if for our lives show

158
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,823
We try to reframe the conversations happening around sexy

159
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,711
What if we use metaphor and euphemism and comedy maybe even a little meditation

160
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
As a way to navigate all the stuff

161
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Swirling around sex ed weather that's a lot in Mississippi or just the general awkwardness that comes with this

162
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Topic

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
So to do this

164
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,607
One thing Sanford and sex Educators from all across the country told us was that a key part of

165
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Assassin classroom

166
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Was

167
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,751
Question box where students could drop in anonymous questions

168
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
And then the teachers would pull them out an answer them to try and facilitate

169
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Discussion

170
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
So we thought what if we make our own question box

171
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
And try and answer the questions

172
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
With this reframing

173
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,135
So we gathered questions from listeners Reddit Sanford

174
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Fifth graders

175
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
It's in no way comprehensive but we gave it a try

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
To kick us off

177
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,839
Here's Majel Connery singing the first question this is just

178
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Turn a mic and a vocoder

179
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,239
.

180
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
.

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,607
Thank you

182
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
It's really

183
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Unbelievable

184
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Feels like someone

185
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Shoving a knife up inside me

186
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Slowly

187
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
But

188
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
With no rhythm that I can track

189
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,647
But you never quite get my head on top of it of predicting it

190
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
If you'll like

191
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Angel and I can't move

192
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Baxton daroga

193
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,471
She's twenty-four of filmmaker and she's talking about what she goes through every month when she gets her

194
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Now

195
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
.

196
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,919
Sort of the weird topic still a little taboo hush-hush

197
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
Isave paternalism Maybe

198
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,599
Like it is a little hard though roughly half the planet doesn't get them

199
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
And even if you do

200
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,535
Every. Is so different they're kind of hard to talk about butts in the

201
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
Has seemingly found a new language for discussing her. And it's with

202
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,495
Kind of an unexpected companion

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Some background

204
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
So

205
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,967
I have endometriosis which is a reproductive illness that one in 10 American women have

206
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Where your endometrium which is usually

207
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Lining of your uterus that gets shed during your period

208
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Start going all these places it's not supposed to

209
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
So on your organs

210
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,839
We did actually such growing outside of your uterus

211
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Each month

212
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,239
And I have no idea about this I feel embarrassed is a 35 year-old woman to have gotten to the

213
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Disappointed not known this

214
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
But each month your body tries to

215
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
Push out all that extra tissue that

216
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Since places

217
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
The cat that would have been

218
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
And so it's very painful

219
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
And you can take birth control to help eliminate the

220
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,719
The pain which attended did for many years but then she started getting depressions and all these complications and so she had

221
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
How to stop

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
And as soon as she did the pain came Rush

223
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,911
King back I got my first period off of birth control I was

224
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Maybe 20

225
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
2 years old

226
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Hit me when I was at

227
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407

And then I had like 30 minutes to get to JFK

232
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
And all of the night

233
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Couldn't move

234
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
She said she just started froze in place in front of the food court

235
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703

He was very helpful but the pain was so bad she was just like I have to call somebody and I still have Wi-Fi

241
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
President called my dad

I asked him what was it like to get that phone call

250
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Couples hiding from me because I couldn't do anything but a helpless

251
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
You can do this

252
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
Feel emotions but not able to

253
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439

Lucinda was in the Casablanca airport and he was all the way in Illinois

256
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
He just started trying to do

257
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Everything

258
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Close your eyes.

00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:00,799
What are you feeling meanwhile sendas literally

260
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
Baby like being in the labor room

261
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,527
She was crying and moaning in Goulds trying to make her feel better as a tossing out all these ideas

262
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
The pain still really bad

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
And then my dad said

264
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Think about a color

265
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
I think about the color red

266
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
And then shifted to different color in your brain

267
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
In that moment

268
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
Send it became 11 years old

269
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,311
It was her first. And the pain was

270
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Terrible

271
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
I was

272
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Laying in bed

273
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,271
My mom couldn't be there and she was almost right there but she had to be at work as having really bad cramps

274
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
So was my dad and my uncle

275
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
Leaning over me trying to help me I was just like

276
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
Mortified that I wasn't really worried about it

277
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
And

278
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
You're my dad

279
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Turn on Gregorian chants

280
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
And

281
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,639
Burn some incense and surveying over my head and he was staying alive

282
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Just

283
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Track the smoke

284
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Figure rise and

285
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Just follow it all the way up

286
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
Imagine you are the smoke and you're just

287
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Bloating and I feel like committing suicide

288
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
And then he was like

289
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Okay

290
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Close your eyes

291
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Imagine

292
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
A color what color are you seeing

293
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Send a realize

294
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
In that moment she could actually

295
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
See the pain it was a

296
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
A thing that had a shape to it that she could identify

297
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
And then

298
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Like okay and now

299
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,951
Time to change it into a different color with your brain

300
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Like ice blue

301
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,239
Cindy found herself thinking back to that moment and once again talking to her dad in

302
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
I'm trying to transform the color of

303
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,127
The pain I remember seeing them on the little

304
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Staircase that leads up to the

305
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Playing

306
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
And I was like ripping on to the

307
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Bar

308
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Try not to fall over

309
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Migrating my

310
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
He just like clenching my job

311
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Fascistic

312
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
The color red

313
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
Okay I see it yeah I see it all right

314
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
Okay come on turn into something else

315
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Pink baby

00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Okay alright

317
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
And she says standing there

318
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
About to board the 7-hour flight

319
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
It actually helped

320
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
And then I'm still in really bad pain

321
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
But mentally I can

322
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
I can stay here

323
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Fit inside of it

324
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
It's like it's very non-judgmental it's like okay I'm feeling pain let's really feeling

325
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Because in his in sushi

Traditional Sindhi culture Linda and her dad are from Southern Pakistan

00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
You don't like

328
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Try to avoid buffering

329
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Instead of just try to

330
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
Breathitt like when someone dies

331
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567

Keep going through it

342
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
To sit with the pain

343
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
That's Point number one

344
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
In point number two is

345
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
Pain to me seems pretty dark

346
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
I don't know about you but I don't know if I would actually think

347
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
About a color

348
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
But Cindy said

349
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
For her family

350
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
It's not that surprising cuz your dad like a little obsessed

351
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
The color

352
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Post-it note hot pink

353
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Bright orange lily

354
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
Purple Rain Purple Rain

355
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Is that cultures that just Unity

356
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Ranmore Common

357
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,383
Send us laughing here but if she was being honest she would say that when she was a

358
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
The kid

359
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Color palette

360
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Open sister really embarrass me

361
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Sorry

362
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
In the end

363
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Color was

364
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
The place that she and her dad were able to meet

365
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
And then just keep meeting

366
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Because the month after Morocco

367
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
Another. More pain she called her dad

368
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,519
The next month another. More page called your dad

369
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
And then the next month

370
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Yeah what are you saying doing in this moment

371
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
The first thing I'm trying to do is just to get closer to

372
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,319
To be in the color rather than trying to switch it right away

373
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,927
I'll close my eyes and

374
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Focus in on

375
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Where the pain is and what it feels like

376
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
And I let it just kind of

377
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Shoot up into my brain and it feels like kind of like

378
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
You watched like a watercolor palak watch across the page you know and everything

379
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
Read all the sudden and the first thing

380
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
I think James

381
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
Haha yeah that's it later

382
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
To be one with it in Nevada

383
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
And then

384
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
I try

385
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Suggest

386
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
Kind of a shift to the Colorado start like no changing with him a little bit and

387
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Orange that's like mixing with the red and then pushing it all the way to something

388
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
You know it's like a wash and it gets like

389
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
And all the sudden the wave is coming in a different color

390
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
At this point in the live show onto the screen these amazing images

391
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
They're hyper saturated

392
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Happy

393
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Surreal

394
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695

395
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
If you want to see them you can go to radiolab.org gonads

396

397

Cinda's inspiration for these photographs is what she sees in her Mind's Eye when she's in

398
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,031
Incredible

399
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Pain

400
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
And she's able to capture the images write them down as her dad is coaching her through

401
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
The color meditation

402
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063

He thinks a lot about the scaling

410
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
The universe in this game of all time

411
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
And then our smallness

412
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,367
Significant or unhappiness in our suffering is anything about all of that

413
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647

A Simons Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process

462

463
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
Additional support for Radiolab is

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

467

And I'm here because I need your help

468
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
And I request

469
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
For those of you who

470
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

471
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Aunts and uncles

472
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,864
Teachers looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

473
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Brilliant

474
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Basically I want to hear about this

475
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
When a kid you know did something

476
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,800
It just means you lean back and say

477
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
How do they do that

478
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Maybe it was the moment that I

479
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

480
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
Or maybe the kid was a piano

481
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,880
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

482
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Or maybe the kids in math class

483
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

484
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
We're interested in the

485
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Epic moments where

486
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,888
A kid does something super smart

487
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
It doesn't have anything to do with

488
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
If you have a story

489
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Go to radiolab.org

490
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Flash brilliance

Flash Brewing

495
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Thank you so much

496
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
This is gonads episode 6

497
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
This is our live show about sex at

498
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,080
So far we've talked about condom demos without any condoms

499
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
.

500
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:58,272
We even went on to talk about the deeply important topic of what happens to all the bananas after condom

501
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Banana demos

502
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
But

503
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
We ultimately went on

504
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
To discuss

505
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
Question that is one of the primary reasons

506
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
I wanted to do this show

507
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Annies

508
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Anythink

509
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,776
Is there anything off-limits

510
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,896
What you find is you can get together a room full of people who you think

511
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,760
Have the same opinion on what should be taught in sex ed in schools

512
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:34,112
But once you boil it down to the nitty-gritty and the fine details

513
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,928
You realize everybody dress a-line

514
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Somewhere

515
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,512
Enter wrestle with outline drawing

516
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,608
We got together a panel of really smart people who think about this

517
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
And we presented them with real-world scenarios we ran into while recording this issue and we tried to have

518
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
Have them do something where they like waved Flags

519
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
For when they saw the line was crossed or 4 when they supported the line that was being drawn

520
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm not sure if the flag thing work too but you may hear reference to it

521
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,648
And so I would like to welcome to the stage I'm going to move

522
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Maybe I shouldn't

523
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
I'm going to stand here and then milk

524
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,984
Education historian and author the sex-ed book too hot to handle John Zimmerman

525
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Muslim youth activist Dahlia

526
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
And sex educator Erica Hart

527
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
Okay so the first one

528
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
December 1st 1994

529
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
Surgeon General Jocelyn elders

530
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
Who is appointed by Bill Clinton

531
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,704
Teaching school children to masturbate as a way of avoiding the spread of AIDS

532
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
She was asked by

533
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
Dr. Rob Clark a psychologist and a unaids conference about the

534
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,456
The prospects of a more explicit discussion and promotion of masturbation as a means to limit the spread of the virus

535
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,832
And she began her reply by saying she's a very strong advocate for sex ed in schools and early age

536
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Quote as per your specific request in regard to masturbation I think that is something that is part of

537
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,792
Human sexuality and is something that should be taught

538
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,448
I think masturbation is really really important

539
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,336
That's part of like a sex ed curriculum but for this reason absolutely not

540
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,480
Like she really liked politicize that reason and it was used not for her own sexual benefits but as like

541
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,880
A way to downplay AIDS and be like this is terrible I don't want anyone to know about this deal with this

542
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Like I don't this seems like

543
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
A red flag to me

544
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
Interesting episode was invented

545
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Comedian on

546
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,288
It was cast it was reported as joycelyn Elders saying that she thought that in schools

547
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Teacher should

548
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
Teach students

549
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,456
How to masturbate that is not what you were saying

550
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,552
What you were saying was masturbation support of human sexuality

551
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,672
A people should be informed about that that's very different than saying we're going to teach them

552
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,560
Which I would then posed to the panel is like would you go as far as doing a how to

553
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
In a sex ed class

554
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
How to masturbate or do you just introduce it as an idea

555
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Well we can talk about what if if there's a yes in there I want to know what a gif

556
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
There's a curious if that's age-related you can't necessarily teach how to and I think also speaking to what you said about

557
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,296
Jocelyn Elders this is another example of how

558
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
Race and sexuality gets

559
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
Completed or not necessarily completed but definitely comes to the table is at

560
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Jocelyn Elders was like literally

561
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,072
Essentially lost her career talking about this was just shows the

562
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
Anti-black origins of ever talking about sex and how our bodies are used in on the lines but when we start talking

563
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,800
Timeout ways that we can actually own them is now a problem

564
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,896
And the other part of that is that you don't necessarily cheap someone

565
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
How to have how to masturbate hashtag Cosmo you can't really do that because

566
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Everybody has a different

567
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,648
Body right and everybody's body is function differently

568
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,976
Like for example me I'm a breast cancer survivor I don't have nipples

569
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
So to be like oh you can stimulate your nipples that would be

570
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
Triggering for me cuz I don't

571
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,472
Have that body parts that feel good for you like I told my fifth graders

572
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
Yesterday

573
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
I never like what like what does that mean I'm like any part of your body you could touch in that is called masturbation right

574
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
So now we know what it means and there's not this

575
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Weird thing around this

576
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,672
I'm am I doing it right Miss which I get questions about oh yeah am I doing it right it feel good to you

577
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Yes

578
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:00,352
This has been a hugely contested question across American history

579
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
Masturbation

580
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Specifically and

581
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
If you

582
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,288
If you don't want to read about masturbation don't study sex education because

583
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,360
Define it's the most contested subject

584
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
Explicitly in only about pleasure

585
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Right

586
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
It's not about procreation

587
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,808
Even though I expect that many people in this audience think that

588
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,136
It sex is for pleasure it's important understand that there are

589
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
Some 330 million Americans

590
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,608
Write some of them think that it's only reserved for heterosexual marriage and it's only reserved for procreation

591
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,496
Discussion

592
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
I was going to say what's the role that

593
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
That

594
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
Like religion has Miss coz masturbation is so tightly.

595
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
Hi to you know I was raised Catholic

596
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Definite No-No right

597
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,368
It said there's bits so tightly tied to that I wonder

598
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
How do you respect

599
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,488
Assertive like religious space when you want to introduce a topic like

600
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Masturbation

601
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,192
I mean a lot of my students will say things like well

602
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
For example God is a man

603
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:17,152
And I don't necessarily agree with that but I have to kind of hold space for that that their understanding of it so say

604
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,248
Same thing with masturbation where it's like I can't masturbate because I'm

605
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
Christian or I'm Catholic

606
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
Okay so you will not masturbate then

607
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,672
Still have to talk about masturbation as you are in

608
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
My sex ed class

609
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,584
And that's a topic going to be to talk about it not necessarily not talk about because there's some students who are religious

610
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
So you don't have to opt-in to everything that I'm saying

611
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
It's just knowledge for you

612
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,800
So you don't go around shaving yourself or someone else for engaging in such Behavior

613
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,688
It's really it's really difficult you know I mean there's shockingly little sex at in the sky

614
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,088
And a lot of reasons for that but one reason is that we differ so fundamentally about sex and sexuality

615
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,232
Or here in lower Manhattan this is not a representative already

616
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
And and sexist

617
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
Tide to use a loaded

618
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
Word are most intimate ideas of ourselves as human beings

619
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
And so if you look at

620
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Western democracies

621
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
What you find is people that objective sex education monster among two groups white Evangelical Christian

622
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
And also recent immigrants

623
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,368
Especially immigrants from

624
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,720
You know I mean these are often groups that agree about nothing else

625
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,816
But in the UK and Sweden and Canada United States

626
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Every account if they are shared objection

627
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
Every newspaper account must use the headline

628
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
Strange bedfellows I've never seen a single journalistic account

629
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
These are people that basically group that nothing including immigration

630
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:59,040
Write up this is hard and it should be hard for people like myself on the left because we say we value diversity

631
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,368
But we also want this thing called comprehensive sex education

632
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
Square that Circle

633
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
You're not into anything

634
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah so I was raised Muslim and I think it's not

635
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Don't teach your kids about sex it's more of us an unspoken heterosexual we use it to procreate

636
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Safeway and I hate like feeding into this like American narrative like Muslims are like all straight cisheterosexual

637
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,856
What are Generations coming and we're like all clear and whatnot but

638
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
But

639
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
It's hard to navigate

640
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
Sex in general let alone masturbation because there is a stigma that's tied not just within the religion but within our own communities

641
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Okay so this one

642
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
What happened at

643
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
Charter School Rocklin California

644
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,080
So a kindergarten class

645
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Student can bring it a book

646
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Can a book have you read during story time

647
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
And so for one of the week

648
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,320
A transgender student brought in a book called I am jazz

649
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Is a book about a transgender

650
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,720
The teacher read the book in class

651
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
And then

652
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
There was a really interesting reaction from the parent

653
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,008
Like a holy crap while we were not prepared for this our kids came home with

654
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Very confused and tons of questions

655
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,432
And I thought this was an interesting one because a lot of what we've been talking about a serf formalize sex ed

656
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
And this is informal sex at

657
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,624
Informal per say I mean it's just about

658
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,184
A person's experience and what

659
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
Cisnormativity does which assist meaning like

660
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
The world is very stiff

661
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Gender dominance

662
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
Is like

663
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:55,520
This is weird now we're going to maybe we should have had a letter about this even need a letter about talking

664
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
About George Washington

665
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Or the Civil War

666
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,176
Or the Vietnam War or World War so why is it that we are talking about

667
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,992
Trans person that now you need to be warned

668
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
That you're going to talk about this

669
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
Tell you what about you I know we were talking backstage you said

670
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
You could go either way on this

671
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
Yeah because my only saying my only qualm is like says people don't know how to facilitate discussion support under with their kids

672
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Especially if your kindergarten

673
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,704
My boy my girl like these questions that you said this yard to ask so I can wish that

674
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,032
The parents knew about it justly be able to facilitate evaporation

675
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,616
It would have been like a productive experience for the kindergarten

676
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
A letter like if

677
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,248
I'm kind of like a letter

678
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
So that way they would have been able to know about this beforehand so like the kid wouldn't come in at like 4 p.m. to be like I don't know what's happening this is what happened at school

679
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,256
You about it beforehand I feel like it could have been a more productive conversation

680
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Look it's really hard

681
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
I share the sentiments that we just heard about cisnormativity and I'm deeply support of a trans rights

682
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:02,592
But I'm also supported the public schools and I understand they are under threat

683
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,480
All right and I think that there's a really delicate balance here if you want people to support your public

684
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Schools UK

685
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,856
At the same time transmit the message it's somehow

686
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
They just didn't get this thing this sex

687
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,000
Sting right and weed school have to intervene

688
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,144
There is a fear I mean I think and what you were saying there's a centering of institutions in this country

689
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,288
It's like up the institution needs to be upheld like don't mess up the school the school is going to fall apart

690
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,152
And if the school for the part that we have nothing rather than centering the most marginalized

691
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
And I think

692
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
To think

693
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,784
Combat a school is going to fall apart but not

694
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,160
Trans folks and non-binary people and genderqueer people. Think about their experience

695
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Is is

696
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
My mind f***

697
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
For lack of better words I think

698
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,352
What is missing in sex education is talking about

699
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,680
Intersectionality which is not just a celebration of

700
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,776
Various identities were talking about the ways in which people are impacted

701
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
Systems of Oppression

702
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
So actually talking about that when you talk about masturbation is this really something that someone has access to if you're talkin about

703
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,576
Putting on a condom why is it that Mississippi the poorest country in this country

704
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
Have no what cannot talk about condoms

705
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:26,048
Like that is really a function of race and class right and really being mindful of that really bringing that into your

706
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Classrooms of people

707
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
Don't necessarily do that they're like up let's just talk about sex and let's just have this conversation and be mindful

708
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
Of the things in which like people are also bringing to the table yet John

709
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
An honest intersectional approach would also acknowledge

710
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Seems anathema

711
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
Don't think they belong to the public school

712
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,952
Believe that their familial and religious matters and not school matter

713
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
I'm not saying I agree with them

714
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,840
I am saying though that an honest intersectional approach

715
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,424
Would have to acknowledge that would have to take

716
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Account of the fact

717
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,824
We are a diverse society and many of our recent immigrants not all

718
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
But many

719
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,432
Find these themes inappropriate for a public

720
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,040
What I said I said it matters that you actually talk about where people are

721
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
You actually get interested and if someone is dealing with

722
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,696
Being documented they probably don't want to talk about masturbation

723
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
As the conversation went on I wouldn't say that we ever actually came to a consensus on any single cell

724
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Scenario

725
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
You can feel it gets torn

726
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,008
But what was brought into the room all of the different things that go

727

00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Bondage and 9th

731
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904

12th grade or live

733
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280

738
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Of the night

739
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,760
Which is a batch of questions

740
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
From

741
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
What is sort of the

742
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Quintessential

743
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368

Stop

748
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
I'll just do a little thing

749
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,800
So last week we heard

750
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
About the sex educator

751
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Who made

752
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
An amazing discovery

753
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,504
This educator is teaching a workshop at a middle school in Southern Maine

754
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
And they were talking to the school nurse

755
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,672
And as they talk they saw that on the nurse's desk there was just like

756
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Overflowing

757
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Envelope

758
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
At she asked what it was

759
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
And it turns out

760
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
The nurse said oh those are my fifth graders

761
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,496
And so we obviously were like we want those

762
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
Thank you very much for telling us the story

763
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,872
And they're pretty great

764
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
And so

765
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,968
We're coming to the end of the night

766
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,576
And like all sex ed classes we've only gotten through about 5 Quest

767
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,952

768
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488

I take long hot tubs

797
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Does that mean I won't make a lot of

798
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Sperm

799
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535

808
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495

811
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
Other girls have developed but I haven't

812
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Can I use a cream

813
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,863
I think creams are always good especially in winter

814
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,263
I would say go for it a little coconut butter it's going to happen eventually just keep moisturized it right

815
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,967
What happens when two sperm reach an egg at the same time

How does a penis fit in a vagina

825
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
It's really hard but there's there's a lot of maneuvering and I would say use

826
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Use each other

827
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,743
When girls are still young does milk come out of their breasts

828
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
When they squash them

829
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,167
I guess it depends how hard you squash them

830
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:34,847
Why do girls have the baby and feed it and help make it in the boys don't have to do anything but help make it
