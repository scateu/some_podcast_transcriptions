7
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Call at on the media

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
The part 3 of our series

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,848
Busted America's poverty because a little while back

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Brooklyn style she put together a wonderful set of Story 5 and all I believe about poverty in the United States

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
It's pretty

12
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
Pretty amazing series and we figure

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,440
Part of what we should do here always is present not just our work but great work that's happening around us

14
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
So we decided to bring Brooke

15
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
Into our studio hello

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
Nice to see you in our territory to talk about what she found in to play a spa

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Parts of the series

18
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
I have to say that except for my comic book

19
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Which tells you a lot

20
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,640
This it was the hardest thing I've ever done professionally

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,504
Really you know it's breaking down a ridiculously complex story into little

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Yeah yeah components and then putting it through the on the media Play-Doh extruder so they came out media shape

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
And the thing is is

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
What we do what on the media is we

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
Examine the

26
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Prevailing narrative and use those as a way to discuss the reality

27
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
I forever be a beggar if you haven't heard on the media you definitely need to listen to

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Non-immediate

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Wired listening

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
These days these days

31
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
But in this series what Brook

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Does is C sort of

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
Goes episode-by-episode in examines

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
One by one that does a big

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,256
Media myths when it comes to Poverty you know like that

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
In 1 episodes.

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
You know the myth of laziness

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Poor people art

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Just lazy and another episode she tackles the myth of the social safety net and it's only going to catch you when you fall

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
That's right

41
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
The upward Mobility myth

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
The one that paints America is a nation where

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Everyone has an equal chance.

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
To surmount any obstacle

45
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Dance from Rags to Riches

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,136
It's an idea phone on our Shores by a founding father and self born into poverty

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Benjamin Franklin

48
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
He's the youngest of 10 sons and his sister

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
Jane is the youngest of Seven Daughters

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Benny and Jenny there called when they're little

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Your father's a Candle Maker in a soap boiler historian Jill Lepore author of Book of Ages the life

52
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Opinions of Jane Franklin

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Rights that Jenny and Benny Ark

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,408
Quotes he teaches her to read they spend their childhood making soap and dipping candles

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Benjamin is an apprentice to his brother who's a printer

56
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
And when he's 16 or 17 year runs away to Philadelphia

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Sofia and he eventually opens up his own printing

58
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,464
And he does so well that Franklin actually manufactures most of the paper

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
The colonies in the 18th century opens up

60
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Owns

61
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
A whole lot of paper mills

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Tiffany 18th century is made from Rye

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Enzo Franklin in his newspaper the Pennsylvania Gazette

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Princess little notices

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Bring in your rags

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Cash for rags

67
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Then sends them to his mail to people

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Franklinville also get the license

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
In Pennsylvania to print paper currency

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
The Franklin literally

71
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Turn Rags to Riches

72
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
And that's really where the notion comes from

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Just think about the phrase Rags to Riches

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Comes

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:47,584
From Ben Franklin having opened up a bunch of paper plants and then paper was made from rags

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,704
And he printed currency and made tons of money doing that hence

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,008
Literally Rags to Riches

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
That's enriched and of course is

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
Fiend for his service to the new nation

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
He recounts his Rags to Riches Saga in a groundbreaking memoir

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
The only

82
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Stories of lies at that point

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
Are the stories of the great of kings and princes

84
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Franklin starts out as a popper

85
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Essentially

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
So he published his autobiography

87
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Be a model

88
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
For young men

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
He wantsto story

90
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Having made his own ride

91
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
This is not to slight the man

92
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Helped draft the Declaration of Independence

93
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Invent the lightning rod his

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Stove bifocals

95
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,663
The flexible catheter and the glass armonica you're hearing now

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,551
And who also launched the first lending library and also the first publicly supported Hospital

97
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,647
Clearly Ben does not want the poor struggling

98
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Starbucks medicine

99
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
What is the general principle

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
He's okay with struggle

101
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
He famously wrote

102
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
The best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading or

103
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Driving them out of it

104
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
And that

105
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
The less was done for them where they did for them

106
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
He's responsible for himself and his great success in his success

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Alone and people in his life

108
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Depend on him

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
On whom he may have depended for support he erased

110
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
And that becomes

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
So much apart of

112
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
The lyric tradition of American autobiography

113
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
So it's like the original pick yourself up by your bootstraps story is like a Ben Franklin

114
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Dimensions of a piece

115
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
One notable absence from Ben's book

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,287
Is Sister Jane married off at 6:15 to a Nair do well with a history of mental illness

117
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
Cast onto two of their sons

118
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
And when most of her 12 children died too young

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Jane races there

120
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
And their children

121
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Children

122
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
Her whole life is constantly trying to Scrabble together

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
Some kind of living by taking in boarders taking in laundry

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Making the family soap

125
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,583
Pop anything in Remembering how important that story is to our sense of

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
The American past is

127
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
Benjamin Franklin sister

128
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Indoors the Fate

129
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Almost

130
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Everybody else in the 18th century does she remains in the station to which she's born and she writes with love to Ben

131
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Epsom impediments

132
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
Are just too hard to break

133
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Through and that's far too much

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Potentialist

135
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Squandered

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Through an accident of birth

137
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,415
And that's the story of Jane Franklin pushes His Brilliant woman

138
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Struggling you know gif

139
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Figure out how to get firewood

140
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
For her many many many many children taken care of Franklin's parents him he abandoned who are sick and destitute in their old age

141
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,311
He comes to Boston anorexic giant Monument to their memory that really just celebrates him and his generosity

142
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
Did the historical record is asymmetrical we know so much more

143
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
About the people who thrive

144
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
And so little about the

145
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
The people who don't

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
You really have to think hard

147
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,903
What is a story tell me what is it not telling what is Franklin's RV tell me what is it not tummy

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Who's missing here

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,303
I love that part by the way I did too but it occurred to me that the myth

150
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Activism

151
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
The story that Ben Franklin told about being an American Boy

152
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Annabelle

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
The upward potential of that

154
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
Or if you started poor

155
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Butt shot

156
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
You couldn't make your voice at the top end

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
That story is still

158
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Pruitt in many people's minds and it started with Ben Franklin but that's exact

159
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
Play the point we're making in the shower

160
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,487
Ever since the self-made man has been the Avatar of the American Spirit

161
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Especially in politics

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,911
Starting with Old Hickory Andrew Jackson right up to Hillary Clinton's fighting her draped making dad

163
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
And Donald Trump claiming he grew his fortune from nothing

164
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
But up

165
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
Small multi-million dollar loan from his father

166
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,479
Likewise the 2004 election feature Dick Gephardt son of a milk truck driver John Edwards

167
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Son of a mill worker

168
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
And Barack Obama

169
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Son of a goat herder

170
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
Reading Jon Stewart to ask Daily Show senior political analyst Stephen Colbert

171
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Thick does it ring Halo

172
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
If everyone

173
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Trumpets this

174
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Bootstrap

175
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Story

176
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Wow

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
That's pretty cynical John

178
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
I for one connected with what they were saying

179
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
Then again I myself

180
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm from Humble Origins

181
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,711
My father was a poor Virginia turd Miner

182
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm sorry

183
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Reminder John that's why I believe in the promise of America

184
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Son of a turd Miner from one day leave those worthless text behind while still using their store

185
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Enhance my own credibility

186
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,847
In terms of the idea of the American idea of upward Mobility the bootstraps myth

187
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
Clearly it happens enough

188
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
So that it persists

189
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
But what what is the case you would make happen enough to make it

190
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
More likely to be in America than to be in the Philippines or in Argentina or

191
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,327
Mexico or is there some kind of analysis that says how many people

192
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Born into a certain

193
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Social place

194
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
End up

195
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,263
Moving up like how many what percentage of Americans

196
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Throughout the course of their life

197
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Actually do better

198
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Well

199
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
The way that you measure this generally

200
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
Is how many people go from the bottom of the fifth

201
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Income bracket

202
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
To the top

203
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
I'm from America on the average is about

204
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
7 and a half percent

205
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
That's

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
If you are

207
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Is it really sounds low to me

208
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
It really

209
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,655
I would imagine it I was hoping for sugar from the bottom to the very top why is that in Canada

210
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
Lights that nearly and in Denmark better and less

211
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,799
So we decided to look at the numbers of hard numbers

212
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
Denmark is 11.7 it's much better than America is at 13.4 which is

213
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Roughly double

214
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,087
You know there's a bunch of countries all across Europe that do better than we do so you know

215
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,927
When it comes to the basic measure of upward Mobility

216
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Not only are we not unique

217
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Resort at the bottom of the pile when measured against them other countries while you sure yeah

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
Crucial thing to remember is that even within the US your chances of moving up there he's

219
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
Subway from one place to another there's a

220
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
Famous researcher named Roth

221
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Chatty at Stanford

222
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
And he showed that in some regions of the country your chances of moving up

223
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
A really good the best in the world

224
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Places like

225
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
San Jose San Francisco Seattle

226
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Salt Lake City to San Jose 12.9% San Francisco 12.2 dc11

227
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
Seattle 10.9 saltlake 10.8 when you get to

228
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,799
Columbus or 9 Atlanta Milwaukee Charlotte Four Points

229
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
4 in Memphis

230
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,223
It's closer to 3% this is the percentage

231
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Of people who are able to sort of move on up

232
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Yeah it sounds like the bootstraps myth

233
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
Is pretty much not there except if you like born in San Jose

234
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Place like that

235
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
Yeah so that just shows that

236
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Your likelihood of moving up

237
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,167
Is based on where you are even more than Who You Are

238
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Let's listen to more of that story Teddy the worst-performing neighborhood sarkar later

239
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Did with segregation income inequality

240
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Single parent families

241
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
Poor schools and lack of social cohesion

242
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
These neighborhoods

243
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Are very often black

244
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
And overlooked when official set budget priorities

245
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
Teddy says that government

246
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Can effectively begin to Boost mobility

247
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
By investing in and fixing those neighborhood

248
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
Meanwhile I can do a better job of moving families

249
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Especially with young kids

250
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
I would have some

251
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
25% of the Gap Band Yearning between blacks and whites

252
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
Is driven simply by the fact that blacks

253
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
Tend to grow up in neighborhoods that are much worse on average

254
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Cny

255
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,111
The government already spends more than 20 billion dollars annually

256
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,231
On housing vouchers calculated to enable poor families to rent in better areas

257
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
But they can take years

258
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Even decades

259
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
To get

260
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,447
And when they get them Most states allowed landlords to refuse vouchers and they often do

261
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Sobeys families wind up where they started

262
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Paying a Savvy slumlord much more for much less

263
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Because there's no place else for them to go

264
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
In 1863

265
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
The Negro was told that he was free as a result of

266
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
The Emancipation Proclamation being signed by Abraham Lincoln

267
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
He was not given any land

268
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
To make that

269
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
Freedom meaningful

270
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,471
Martin Luther King at the National Cathedral in Washington 1968

271
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,079
It was something like keeping a person in prison for the number of years and

272
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
Suddenly discovering that

273
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
That person is not

274
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
Guilty of the crime for which he was convicted

275
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Just go up to him and say now you are free

276
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
But you don't give him any bus fare to get to town

277
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
And the irony of it all is that at the

278
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Same time

279
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
The nation

280
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
Failed to do anything from the Black

281
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,799
It was giving away millions of acres of land in the West in the middle

282
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
Which meant that it was willing to undergo that's right persons from Europe with an economic floor but not only did it give the land

283
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Built

284
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Land

285
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Grant colleges

286
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Teach them how to farm

287
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
It provided

288
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,511
Low interest rate so that they could mechanize out forms

289
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
And to this day

290
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,911
Thousands of these bad persons are receiving

291
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,775
Millions of dollars in federal subsidies every year not the phone

292
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
American soil from the vet people

293
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
Tell Negros that they must lift themselves

294
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
By their own bootstraps

295
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
It's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps

296
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
But it is a cruel jest

297
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Say to a bootless man

298
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
That he ought to lift himself

299
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
By his own bootstraps

300
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,311
In 2003 the National Bureau of economic research published a famous study

301
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,639
In which researchers responded to help wanted ads

302
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:46,527
Clerical administrative in customer service jobs in the Chicago Tribune and the Boston Globe

303
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,111
Applied with names associated with whites like

304
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
Greg or blacks like Jamal

305
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
Based on naming data for babies born in the late 70s

306
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
The white names produced 50% more call back

307
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
A white name yielded as many more callbacks is an extra eight years of experience on a black resume

308
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,591
In another study based in New York whites with criminal records

309
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
Got more callbacks than blacks with clean records

310
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
So much for bootstrap

311
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
EB White Once Road

312
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,623
Luck is not something you can mention in the presence of self-made men

313
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Indeed surveys find that

314
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,303
Wealthy people are far more likely than poor ones to say hard work is what leads to

315
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,631
6s and 2 credit hard work above all

316
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
So they're happy lot in life

317
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
Of course hard work and talent matter

318
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
But they offer no guarantee

319
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Has Robert Frank

320
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,687
Professor of Economics at Cornell University observes in 6s

321
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
And luck

322
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Good fortune and the myth of meritocracy

323
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
He said success may also hang on the month or location of your birth not to mention the wealth you're born with

324
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
But when we compose our personal narratives

325
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Those things recede into the Mist

326
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
As Frank found when confronted by Fox News host

327
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
Stuart Varney

328
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
You are lucky

329
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
That's outrageous

330
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
That is outrageous

331
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
What about the risk

332
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,759
You know what risk is involved in Coming To America with absolutely nothing

333
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
You know what risk

334
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
With a British accent

335
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,999
A total Foreigner you know what

336
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
I do

337
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Is it luck

338
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
You hold a tenured position

339
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Yes

340
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
I'm insulted

341
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
If you come to America

342
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
How do you play by the rules

343
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
You work hard

344
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
You get discipline inside yourself

345
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
That's not true

346
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,631
I got in my cab leaving the studio and of course only then that I

347
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Think about all of it

348
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:17,311
Fat pictures he'd thrown my way that I've completely failed even to swing it but I'm speaking sometime later at New York

349
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
University

350
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,151
He said he'd come to the USA with nothing

351
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:26,783
He had a degree from the London School of Economics that's that's coming to the US with nothing

352
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
He had

353
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,671
Somehow overcome the handicap of working in America with a British accent

354
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
Americans love British accents

355
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
He said he took risks

356
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
What what's a risk I looked it up

357
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
Merriam Webster

358
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,215
Risk is the possibility that something bad or unpleasant

359
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Such as an injury or loss what happened

360
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Who took risks

361
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Any 6 seater

362
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
Well that means by definition that he was lucky

363
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
.

364
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
But I didn't have the wit to point that out

365
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
What does it matter pointing it out

366
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Well as Frank notes

367
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Several studies suggest

368
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
That when we

369
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Feel gratitude

370
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Play more generous to strangers

371
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
When were reminded of Lux importance

372
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,495
We are more likely to plow some of our own Good Fortune back into the common good

373
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
We under play lock

374
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Because we can recall our own

375
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
Struggles far better than the faithful but fuzzy role of chance

376
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,039
And because the very idea corrodes our face and free will

377
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
But mostly because

378
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Like Penny Franklin

379
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,951
But deeply invested in our own autobiographies

380
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Take me

381
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,631
My parents went broke a couple of times once we had to put all our stuff out on the lawn to be auctioned

382
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
I went to college almost totally on 8th

383
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
But I always knew

384
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
I was going to college

385
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,383
Even on nights when supper with leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken I brought home from the job

386
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
I knew

387
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
This was temporary

388
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
So I can say wow I'm really self-made

389
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
But I know I'm not

390
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Sure

391
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
I always kind of knew I was lucky

392
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
But not into working on this

393
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Series

394
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,047
Did I really begin to understand what that meant

395
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Hard work is

396
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Real

397
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Bootstraps are bunk

398
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
And social Mobility

399
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,079
Unless a nation chooses to build the infrastructure the roads

400
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
On which a person can move upward

401
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
The pretty much can't get there from here

402
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,903
Where to take a quick break and when we come back we'll take a look at another myth about poverty

403
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
Brooke Gladstone and

404
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
You'll

405
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Hear an interview that just

406
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
When I heard it

407
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Like stop me cold

408
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,679
This is Sam calling from Denver Colorado Radiolab

409
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
Supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

410
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,079
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

411
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,175
More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

412
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

413
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
And I'm here because I need your help

414
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
And I request

415
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories

416
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I

417
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
So did something

418
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

419
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

420
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math

421
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,279
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

422
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

423
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,495
It doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story

424
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
T-shirt with us

425
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

426
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,407
Record a short audio message for us

427
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
And that's radiolab.org brilliance

428
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Thank you so much

429
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
Hey back I'm Jedi Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich says Radiolab

430
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Series of stories that

431
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
They broadcast called busted America's poverty myths already going through the upward Mobility but

432
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
This next one

433
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
It gets a little more

434
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Personal

435
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Let me just say that

436
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
What is the most important

437
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Hearts

438
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
This whole Enterprise for me

439
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
Was to let people

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Tell their stories

441
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Bully as they could

442
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
In their own voice

443
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
And I

444
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
And that was the case was Margaret Smith

445
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,496
She started doing with me and end in chat in chapter 4

446
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
Yes can you can you set up

447
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Set up the conceit

448
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
So we did the myth of bootstraps

449
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
And this was the myth of the safety-net

450
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
That's what this was about

451
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,464
And I'm Brooke Gladstone busted America's poverty myths

452
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
This time it's limited America's social safety net so imperfect still is able to catch p

453
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
People eating conomic freefall before they slam the pavement but there's no way to confront that

454
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
Without conveying how that

455
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,688
So prepare yourself for the narrative equivalent of black

456
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
And I talked about

457
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
How

458
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
Many many people only have

459
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
$1,000 or less in savings

460
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
And that a majority of people

461
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Would not be able to

462
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
Save themselves from

463
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,424
A relatively inexpensive from her point of view

464
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Short-term emergency

465
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
I'm so what I was trying to do in that episode

466
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,152
Was to describe the way that people put their lives together

467
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
And how fragile

468
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,760
Those arrangements are

469
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
And Margaret was an example of that

470
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
So get ready for that

471
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
Boom Splat I mentioned at the top

472
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
The sound of someone

473
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Crashing through the safety net

474
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
How are you

475
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
We're at the YWCA Family Center order Lyon

476
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Columbus Ohio

477
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
My name is Margaret

478
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
And I have

479
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
6 children

480
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
5 boys and 1 Girl

481
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
The reason I ended up in the shelter

482
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Because

483
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
My son was shot outside of our house

484
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
P17

485
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
He knew the girl

486
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
He's the dater and he didn't want to be with her anymore

487
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
She came with some guys

488
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
And they shot my son six times

489
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
He like Mom help me I feel like I'm about to die

490
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
So you're not going to die on me today

491
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
All the kids were sitting in a tree watching

492
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
I'm seeing this Plus

493
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Good shot of his neck

494
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
Hog rider blanket put around his neck

495
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Put a mod in it

496
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
I told my 15 year old daughter I need you

497
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
To put your hands right here and apply pressure to his neck

498
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,064
11 year old went to get a pillow off the couch to elevate his head

499
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
He says sissy keep talkin to me talk to me talk to me

500
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Timeless finally got there

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
As he is in ICU fighting for his life

502
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
I go home three days later go to the landlord to pay the rent

503
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
She tells me did you get the eviction notice

504
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
I said what eviction notice

505
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
She said we have a three-day eviction notice

506
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
So I called the attorney that was over the property

507
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
My day was made a mutual decision

508
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,576
To leave in 45 days by let him know that I can't leave in 3

509
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Because I'm still at the hospital

510
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
You had violated your agreement in their view because you had committed a crime at once

511
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
For lack of

512
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Payment it was

513
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
Because

514
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
A crime was committed on the property

515
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
But it wasn't

516
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
The people that live in the property that committed the crime

517
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
He was a victim

518
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
So I ended up in the shelter

519
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
I lost my job

520
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
I worked at a customer rep

521
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,576
Southern Connecticut Gas gas pump

522
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
They could hold my position they had me go through Aetna

523
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
To see if they will get it approved

524
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Under Disability

525
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
They denied it

526
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Sunny can't hold my position

527
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
44 week I need to take care of my son

528
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Set a timer knighted me

529
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
So not only did I lose my place

530
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,336
I lost my job and I ended in the shelter

531
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
And not only that

532
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
All my kids are spread out in different places

533
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
My son is still healing

534
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
He still had nurses

535
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Physical therapy

536
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
It is just breaking my heart that I can't be with my kids

537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Where are they

538
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
My son is at my mother's

539
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
My daughter is at our aunts

540
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
And my other son is out of cousin

541
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
And I have the two youngest ones with me here

542
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
It's just been a nightmare

543
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
I've been trying to find places

544
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
But everytime I go to the place

545
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
3x

546
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
Well how are you going to

547
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Continue to pay the rent

548
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
I'm going to go to work

549
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
And pay the rent like any other normal person

550
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Badoo

551
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Just right now

552
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
My main focus is getting my children

553
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Back together

554
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
In the house

555
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
Me and my family were victims

556
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Apocrine

557
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
So why should we

558
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Lose everything

559
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
Because of what someone else

560
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Created for us

561
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
It's not fair

562
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Tell me about you

563
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
My oldest son

564
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
That's why I'm he's a diabetic

565
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
23

566
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Very good kid

567
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
He helps me with the children while I work

568
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
My other son

569
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Raymond cook

570
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
Is the one that was shot he was 17 years old

571
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Every morning

572
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
He would

573
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
Get the kids off the school which is down the street from my house

574
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
And then he will go to school

575
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
So by him being in the hospital

576
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
That

577
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
I didn't have the kids in daycare

578
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Because I feel like I had enough older kids

579
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
We can put together

580
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
And make this work

581
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
So everything is just

582
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Screwed up

583
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
My 15-year is my daughter

584
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Tiara cook

585
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Straight Outta roasted in

586
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Tigers basketball

587
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
She wants to be a lawyer when she grow up she's trying to get a scholarship

588
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
11 year old

589
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
What time is the alarm

590
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
He

591
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Is so supportive

592
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,192
When I was at the shelter in my room

593
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
I just broke down crying

594
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
He grabbed me

595
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,592
Mommy is going to be okay

596
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,408
Can you put my big head on his little shoulder

597
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
UC with some skilful juggling should maintain a stable if fragile life for her family

598
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
But lethal ex-girlfriend

599
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Sweating like a hurricane in

600
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Blew it apart

601
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Margaret has health insurance

602
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
The kids and food stamps

603
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
But no money

604
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,704
There's a lifetime limit on cash assistance of 60 months and Margaret had used it all up

605
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,800
Many years ago when her father died she required long treatment

606
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,104
To overcome a suicidal depression

607
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Later she had diverticulitis

608
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,992
And she has a mass in her throat surgically removed

609
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Then a hip replace

610
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
She needs another one but obviously that will have to wait

611
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,976
Now she has to get all those balls back up in the air I got to get my kids out of here

612
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
We done came a long way

613
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
You from the projects

614
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
Semi moving living on my own

615
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
The last 7 years

616
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Paying regular rent

617
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
I didn't ever want to go back

618
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
2

619
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
The projects

620
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
My needs are all my life

621
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
That project will destroy

622
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Especially young men

623
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
You don't have a chance

624
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,992
You got people that's in the gang over here it'll swallow your kids up

625
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
I had to go

626
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
It came to my house

627
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
So

628
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
It's what I say

629
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Even people that got money and

630
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Power

631
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
Don't walk around with your head up high

632
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
Some people look at you like all your beneath me your this year that but I'm still a person I have a heart I haven't been since I might not have got there

633
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Forget

634
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
But I'm working towards it

635
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
You treat people

636
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,176
How you want to be treated rather they have a dollar in my pocket a penny or you

637
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
A millionaire

638
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Because

639
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
You never know when it's your time

640
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
Anything can happen

641
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,440
You might be on top of the world tomorrow but it can end for you to next day

642
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
And you will go through poverty what we going through

643
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
James Baldwin once observed

644
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,168
Anyone who's ever struggled with poverty knows how it's

645
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
How extremely expensive it is to be poor

646
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
If you're poor you pay more for public transit

647
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Because you can't afford a monthly pass

648
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
Or you rely on old cars that break down and cost more to fix while paying gas prices that have out

649
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Run your wages

650
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,112
You pay more for car insurance because of where you live

651
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
You pay more for rent

652
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
And your place is worth

653
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
If you're poor you're unlikely to eat healthy meals

654
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,608
Because healthy food costs an average of $45 more a month

655
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Minimum wage

656
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
You can't buy any food cheap

657
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,008
Sleep because it cost more in poor neighborhoods

658
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
And without spare cash

659
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
You can't even save by buying in bulk

660
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
You're less likely to have a bank account because of

661
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
Soaring fees and penalties

662
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
You cash checks at places that take a cut

663
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
You also pay a higher percentage of your income in state and local taxes but no rest of us do

664
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
And so on

665
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,560
It's Death By A Thousand Cuts and no way to staunch the bleeding

666
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
As Baldwin wrote

667
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,936
1 feet have simply been placed on the treadmill forever

668
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,520
Yuan 30 by now and nothing you have done that's helped you to escape

669
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
The track

670
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
What is worse than that

671
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
The nothing you have done

672
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,456
And as far as you can tell nothing you can do

673
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
Will save

674
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
Your son or your daughter

675
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Bonita same disaster

676
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
Possibly coming

677
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
And

678
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Like I know

679
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,216
I know that people construct their lives in such a way where there is zero margin for error

680
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
On some level I think every parent who isn't

681
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Made of money

682
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
Lives in that state where

683
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Any moment

684
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Drop everything to go deal with a sick kid or whatever

685
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
But this was that

686
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Ordinary experience

687
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Taken to a degree that was

688
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,368
Shocking was truly shocking

689
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:59,744
That you could see somebody making it and then suddenly they fall and they fall so hard and so quickly

690
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
And

691
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
For no other reason than they just got black

692
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
You know from me

693
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
To hear that

694
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,008
FICA so yes the shooting was

695
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Uninvited and unexpected

696
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
But

697
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
Then comes the eviction

698
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
And then comes

699
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
The refusal to amend

700
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
Or in any way

701
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Spoon the eviction

702
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
In the face of what is

703
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Obviously

704
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,928
Well that's because people

705
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,768
Find Lisa saying if there is any police action on your property

706
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,840
You have an instant eviction

707
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,168
I mean it isn't instant it's 3 weeks and they won't

708
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
Stop it they won't stop at for anybody I've heard this

709
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Over and over again that

710
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,872
Wasn't just because of some recalcitrant landlord

711
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
That

712
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Is

713
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
What goes on every day

714
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
In America

715
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
