17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,800
A really important moment

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
American History X

19
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
You have to say

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
American cultural history

00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
Yeah and

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
It almost feels like a single

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Individual

24
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
Walks into one room

25
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,440
And says something startling to a group of very important people

26
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
Cousin accidental

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Mama did he just happen to be over here talking again so by a crazy quilt

28
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Serendipity

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Enormous changes come out. That may be oversimplifying it and I'm sure there's a lot else going on deeper

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,896
Inshallah rhythms but the changes come

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Almost by accident

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Because someone

33
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Mrs.

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
A train

Yeah yeah that's it that's a pretty good are you there you go okay

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
So can we play it

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Yeah let's play it

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
This is unerased

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,328
A new podcast reveals the hidden history of conversion therapy in America on Jad abumrad this

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Episode 3

41
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
Start this episode by talking about one of the great successes in psychology

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
If you're living with a mental health problem

43
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
It can be hard to know which way to turn

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
What to do to feel better

45
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
Call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
You hear about it sometimes the news around a treatments for PTSD like suppose a soldier

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Triggered by a loud sound

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,792
Well what the therapist will sometimes to do is take that same sound play it for the person

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
Over and over but under less and less

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Stressful circumstance

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
Until gradually over time

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
The sound gets less stress

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
CBT focuses on goals

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Focuses mostly on the present-day as things that are affecting you and your life now these kind of techniques can help

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
People with gambling addiction stop gambling people who smoke stop smoking it is a hugely important

56
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
Wave in Psychotherapy is often called the second way

57
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
What is the verse this is the second end

58
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
What follows is a story about one of the grand pubahs of this second wave and a grande

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
Awakening has he had

60
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
It kind of blew up the world

61
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Okay maybe that's overstating it

62
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
But

63
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,504
Turn up the volume

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Case in point this guy this is David tiesler we bumped into him digging through some archives at The Association for Behavior and cognitive

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,512
Therapy central office, only I and him were hunting around for some tapes

66
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,120
While they were obviously mentioned it like yeah Jerry Torres

67
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
He's trained practically everybody in the field

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984

70
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Ja

78
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Careers

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
You might call him one of the six

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Cardinal Bishop

81
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Contemporary psychology

82
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,983
Is Sigmund Freud

83
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
It's Gerald Gerald middle initial C

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Last name davisson Davison

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
Professor of psychology

86
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
University of Southern California

87
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Jerry Krupp the 1940s Orthodox Jewish also playing stickball in the streets of Boston at a time

88
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
And when the streets were pretty empty

89
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,167
Because of the work that was a good little boy and didn't get into trouble and no

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,007
Says he was kind of a quiet kid wasn't a particularly cheerful

91
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Child I would say

92
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
Analytical

93
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Watchful

94
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,431
Neo Jerry eventually finds himself one day working in a ham fact

95
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
That's wonderful

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
Can Ambien be like Hammond like a man

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
Well okay have a weird place for a Jewish kid to be but there he was

98
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
I had a job

99
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
In the graveyard shift that would start like that

100
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
Midnight and go until 8 a.m.

101
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
One day he is at the ham Factory or maybe on his way to the ham Factory board what was there to do so I always I was reading

102
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Somehow I settled on

103
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
Freud's introductory lectures at Clark University

104
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
That he gave in the early 20th century

105
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,855
So he's reading freudenheim Factory reading Freud's lectures and something about it

106
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Hooksett

107
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,743
But also horrifying this book made a profound impact on me

108
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Unstoppable

109
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
Rent professional

110
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Okay so this is Freud that you're hearing right now don't know what the hell you saying the only recording exist

111
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Unconscious

112
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
Talking about the unconscious and kind of make that word out

113
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
And Jerry says the whole idea that you could like peel back the layers of a human psyche

114
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
It was absolutely

115
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Almost voyeuristically fascinator

116
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
The same time

117
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
He says

118
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
Like some of the things Freud was saying

119
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Weird how can Ford say

120
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
If you dream of a

121
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
Train going into a tunnel

122
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,975
You're really dreaming of having sex with your mother

123
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Anyhow something about the book both

124
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Intrigued and enraged him enough

125
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Did he goes to Stanford and then Stony Brook

126
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
And to make a long story short

127
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Ends up standing at

128
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
Exactly the right place

129
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
Where many streams converge to create the first real upending of Freud

130
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,503
The behavioral therapy Revolution

131
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,391
Previously it been all about dreams and the subconscious now with scientific

132
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Experiments

133
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
You know the basic

134
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Question

135
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
How do you get with a suffering human being

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
And help them

137
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,191
How do you make someone happier less anxious to express

138
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,359
Do you remove the first patient you start seeing yeah it would be it would those so-called

139
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,943
Yavis yunnan yavis yav is

140
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
It's it's another acronym alcohol in it

141
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Young

142
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Young

143
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
I want the A stand for

144
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Able or Interactive

145
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
The yavis patient

146
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,583
It's the patient's release

147
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
It is a term psychotherapies that describe the perfect young attractive verbal intelligent and successful

148
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
That's it you got it

149
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
So you know early on he says he saw a lot of people who were

150
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Your classic garden-variety neurotics

151
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Not afraid

152
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Compliment creature in butt

153
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
He said that is what they used to call me

154
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
The whole reason we're telling you this story is that

155
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
In that initial batch of patients

156
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Jerry says

157
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
He began to see

158
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Like fairly frequently these young man walk in

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
They're mostly young men

160
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Who complained that they were

161
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Sexually attracted to other men

162
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
And they really wish they were

163
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
That's right

164
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,591
He says he can't remember how many exactly walked in maybe somewhere between 4 and a dozen I'm trying to think of

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
They were they all came

166
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
And then I supervise some cases

167
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
And the training clinic at Stony Brook they all came

168
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Because they weren't happy

169
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
And they wanted to change they wanted you to turn them from gay to straight

170
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Yeah

171
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
And not wanting to

172
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
Olympos my

173
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,143
Heterosexual values on them some would say my heterosexist values on them

174
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
I would check it out with them

175
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Can you tell me a little bit about what your

176
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
Living situations like your social life and

177
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Xiamen apartment off campus

178
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
By myself

179
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,015
In fact the film

180
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
Where I really roll played myself I wasn't acting but we did have a graduate student

181
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Play the role of a

182
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
Troubled homosexual young man wanted to change

183
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
You'll see in that film

184
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
A pretty reasonable

185
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Rendition have you ever previously

186
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
No

187
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
I thought of going before then

188
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
Terry says the film that he made with your hearing

189
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Is survival composite of all the cases and Esau of this kind and what you see in the film is hems in a suit

190
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Sitting in one chair

191
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
Couple feet away from him is a young man with big 70s hair

192
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
What's a mage

193
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
And the guy explains that he

194
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Having trouble concentrating

195
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Having no

196
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Call trouble getting down to work it turned out

197
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
But he was recently prices

198
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,311
Buy an intensification of his long-standing attraction to men

199
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Jerry says initially

200
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
He had no idea what to do with these case

201
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
They were anxious

202
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Very depressed

203
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
These are folks who

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
The kind of people could

205
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
You know

206
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Commit suicide

207
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
He says he felt like he just had to help that's what I was taught

208
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
That's what I was taught

209
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
And so in the film

210
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
You don't after maybe I don't know

211
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
15 minutes

212
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Jerry says to the guy

213
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Outline for UA

214
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Now before we actually get in

215
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Procedure

216
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,599
Just a little bit of context is necessary

217
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
I not suggest

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
Sexually I'm taking a lot of waste time Jerry was not the only therapist in the situation there were a lot of therapist

219
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Is around the country trying to quote help their gay patients

220
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055
Anything that we can do to prevent future Generations

221
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
From suffering this Affliction must be done

222
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
The overall approach certainly did not start with me there were other people who were doing what we

223
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
What's called behavior therapy with gays

224
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Most of it

225
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Was aversion therapy

226
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
Turtle file Spanish comes from your body

227
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
The odor so strong which was applying electric shocks when they saw pictures of

228
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Same sex people

229
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Or making them

230
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Nauseated

231
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
With injections we vomit again and again all over everything is one of the leading of

232
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
Aversion therapist coming to Stony Brook where he's training at the time to give a lecture

233
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
The guy showed 16 mm

234
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
Films how it was done

235
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
Hooking up gay men to electrodes to their fingers of their forearms show them pictures of men naked men

236
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
Physical pain

237
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Do it again

238
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
This bothered me just personally this had the this is Bob the idea of an intense

239
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Ashley inflicting

240
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Physical pain on

241
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Other people

242
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
I just worried about it

243
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
It was cringeworthy

244
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Interesting Lee

245
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Jerry

246
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
Doesn't fault the researchers who administer those shocks

247
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
Pictures they were like dentist before Novocaine

248
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
2 in a pulling a tooth I'm old enough to remember

249
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
What going to the dentist was like to get a filling or getting

250
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
A tooth pulled

251
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Before there was Novocaine

252
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Decide to write analogy

253
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
It was your tooth hurts you need to have it pulled out you don't need to have your homosexuality pulled out of you may not think so

254
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
But if if you're gay

255
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:30,239
In the 1960s

256
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Haunted and discriminated against

257
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,663
CBS News survey shows that two out of three Americans

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
Discomfort or fear and being told that your

259
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
An evil person that you're disgusting these people need help and so what Feldman was trying to do

260
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
Helping a eating aversion therapist who's the guy that showed

261
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
That felt he was doing the best

262
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,095
That he could given what was available knowledge

263
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Yeah

264
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Yeah that's why I don't demonize

265
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,615
As Jerry is sitting there in the bathroom watching this guy Feldman show this film

266
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
People being tortured

267
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
He says

268
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
He just kept thinking

269
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
She's do we have to do it this way

270
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
The people were saying

271
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
Well but it works and

272
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
That's what the literature was telling us

273
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
But I was thinking while other other ways to do it

274
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,375
And so what Jerry decided to do was take the basic idea of aversion therapy

275
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
And flip it

276
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,983
So what am I supposed to do now I'm supposed to argue well

277
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
I want you to connect to

278
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Follow Me If You Can I don't want to say now

279
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,711
Nswc in the film he basically tells the patient

280
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Baidu

281
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,367
Grab a copy of Playboy magazine

282
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
You go to the nurse and get a copy Playboy was what I thought of as

283
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Source of material

284
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Attractive

285
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,655
Women then he says when you get back home get yourself aroused or whatever you're cussing

286
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,007
Think about a man think about his body

287
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
Homosexual image

288
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
There comes a point

289
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
You know

290
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
The inevitable point

291
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
At that point of

292
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Inevitability switch over to the female picture

293
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
Have you ever had your climax

294
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
And

295
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
My schedule was it said of shocking people into hating their Gay Thoughts he would gently encourage them to take their positive

296
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Gay Thoughts

297
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
And map them onto a different body

298
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
I fact I think the technical term was orgasmic reorientation

299
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
And in the video apparently it's

300
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Seems to work

301
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,967
In the video of Jerry checks in with him about 10 times

302
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
And the guy tells him it first

303
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,855
It was really hard for him to finish the deed while looking at female pictures

304
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
But then it got easier

305
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Any easier

306
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
Until finally after about 10 of these sessions

307
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
I really feel like I'm really getting into it now

308
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
What happened was

309
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Every time I masturbated I found now

310
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Erin go straight through

311
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Without any trouble you know what

312
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Do you like you like what

313
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
I think the thing I like most is I now see some direction I feel myself

314
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Moving

315
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Towards something as opposed to

316
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Not knowing which way I was

317
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
NFL

318
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
And I think that's a good feeling

319
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,207
Okay setting aside for a moment the question of whether this therapy actually

320
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
What

321
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
I think you can guess the answer to that

322
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
And it is not the point of the story

323
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
What happened to Nick

324
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
Is it disturbing takes on an entirely

325
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Surprising

326
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Inconsequential

327
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Life of its own

328
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
And that's after the break

329
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,431
I'm Jenna Home Run Race on Radiolab

330
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
This is Katie from Big Sky Montana

331
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,343
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

332
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,439
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

333
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
More information about Sloan

334
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Www.

335
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,167
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

336
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,287
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

337
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

338
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

339
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,391
Williams basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

340
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

341
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

342
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,775
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

343
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

344
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

345
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
If you have a story please share it with us

347
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

348
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Thank you so much

349
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
I'm dead I'm running Robert krulwich this is Radiolab we're listening to a story from the series the police called on her

350
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
Ray stantz get back now to the story of

351
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,047
Dr. Jerry Davidson and the gay cure it is 1966-67 Jerry has pioneered

352
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
This new

353
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,167
Kind of conversion therapy called orgasmic reorientation is made a video about it

354
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
Shortly after making this video Jerry found himself reading

355
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
The very magazine implicated in his therapy

356
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Naturally reading it just for the articles

357
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
As they say

358
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
And

359
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
I was reading the Playboy forum

360
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,855
That's the section the magazine where readers write letters talk about stuff voice concerns and in the Forum

361
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
This could have been

362
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
Around 1966 or 67

363
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,839
They were people writing in trouble by their homosexuality

364
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
He's only found when I was in the hospital the doctor

365
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Told me they were very futuristic

366
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
And I should try to adjust

367
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
My condition

368
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Well

369
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Being a card-carrying behavior therapist

370
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
I wrote a letter

371
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Play boy crazy with me and I said

372
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
Actually there are new procedures

373
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
For helping gay men

374
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Become less gay and comes from behavior therapy and I don't know what else are low

375
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
Well

376
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
They reprinted it

377
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
What ensued in the Playboy form over the course of many issues

378
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,079
Many years since I was a vigorous

379
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Back and forth

380
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,759
Jerry's letter prompts series of other letters some positive some negative one in particular which calls out of her

381
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Immersion therapy

382
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,903
At the cruel thing which then causes one of the world's leading aversion therapist

383
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,743
Guy by the name of David Barlow to jump in and defend himself

384
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
He writes

385
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,399
Are procedures are not torturous or the Inquisition rather methods drive from experimental Laboratories

386
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
And carefully applied to consenting human beings

387
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
To relieve suffering

388
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
That letter prompts a famous gay activist

389
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
Frank kameny to jump in with his own response

390
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
He writes

391
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,479
I find the August Playboy Forum letter of David H Barlow

392
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Ben Savannah Lester death

393
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,367
Not only the failures of psychology and Psychiatry their approach to homosexuality

394
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
They also have the dangers of human engineering

395
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
You're so weird fact

396
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
Kennedy's letter was titled gay is good and just a few years later post on wall

397
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
That preys

398
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
Would become the slogan of the entire gay rights movie

399
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
And this is maybe the first time

400
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
That phrases used

401
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
In the pages of Playboy everyone

402
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
Raves about how Interactive

403
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
The internet is

404
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,792
People forget how interactive Playboy magazine was

405
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
Okay so this is a little bit of a digression

406
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,704
But I think it's one so worth taking that's James Peterson

407
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,288
I was senior staff writer /

408
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Senior editor

409
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,944
Free Playboy magazine Playboy from 1973 to 2003

410
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
He sort of the institutional memory of the old Playboy

411
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
Last Man Standing

412
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
There is James reminded me

413
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
I never even knew this

414
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
Begin with

415
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Hugh Hefner's

416
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Intent with Playboy was just to show naked lady

417
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Yashow philosophy

418
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
3 actually spelled out in great detail

419
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
I call it the term paper

420
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
That changed America

421
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Hefner was an under

422
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Graduate the first Kinsey Report on male sexuality came out

423
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,184
Tens of thousands of people have cooperated it was a bolt from the blue

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
It changed hafner's life it came out I think maybe

425
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
48 and it describes the range of male sexuality

426
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Without judgment Kinsey describe Nails on a range of

427
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
125 from Strictly heterosexual to strictly homosexual but in the Middle where

428
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Show me like 35% of American men had had a homosexual experience in their adolescent

429
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,792
So the straitjacket was

430
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
Release and what struck Hafner

431
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,776
The indicated for the first time statistically the great disparity

432
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
This dissonance existed between

433
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Hyperfest

434
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Police and Thief

435
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
The actual

436
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,248
Actions of society between sex laws

437
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,112
Versus what people were actually doing this is one good reason for

438
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Questioning some of the old morality

439
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:29,024
And so I would have to start a Playboy along with the magazine and

440
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Playmates

441
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
Along with all of the televised parties from the Playboy Mansion

442
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Along with all that James says he wrote this constant stream of sa monthly installments

443
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
1s a month

444
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
For two years

445
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Like really long essays

446
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,832
Some capitalism religion essays on the history of sex

447
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
Collectively became known as The Playboy philosophy

448
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
The philosophy really I think

449
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,000
Here's an anti puritanism

450
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
And James says behind the scenes through the Playboy Foundation we were funding court cases it Advanced cave

451
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Hayrides abortion-rights

452
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Birth control rights

453
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,336
James says the Playboy Forum was part of that whole initiative

454
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Right after he finished that 2 years old

455
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Chain of essays

456
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
After them created that space

457
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
In the front of the magazine

458
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
4

459
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
People who had

460
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
Nowhere else

461
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Tutor

462
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
And it was in that space

463
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
Where you had some of the first

464
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Open

465
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,840
Discussions of homosexuality in America

466
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,656
Ever and I said you know it's you look back

467
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
The sexual Revolution happened on the Newsstand

468
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Testing

469
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,664
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

470
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Locate back to Jerry story recording of a workshop by Gerald C Davison October 6th 1972

471
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
To New York Hilton

472
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:03,744
Playboy letter episode of side Jerry continue to push his Playboy therapy and in fact he says

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Monk's therapist

474
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
Technique kind of started to blow up

475
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,960
And in 72 he ends up getting invited to give a workshop I want to

476
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Yearly convention

477
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
Do you some ideas and

478
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
Data and whatnot from our point of view as we have been

479
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Working

480
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
With homosexuals skip over the actual

481
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Specifics of that Workshop

482
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,648
Well I think it's clear that we have solved all the problems of things field has

483
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,744
Because what's more consequential

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Is what happens after the pain

485
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
Jerry is a hanging out waiting for the room to clear and this young young man walks

486
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Chubby he was a little chubby

487
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
But my age

488
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
Cherry was 33 at the time very pleasant

489
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,920
Very friendly lot of smiles I don't recall if he had any a beard

490
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
He came up to me

491
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
Introduced himself as a graduate student

492
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Rutgers

493
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
He said I you know I heard your talk

494
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
I thought it was

495
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Interesting

496
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,512
I'm actually give you talked myself the next day if I hang out some flyers for it

497
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
And I said

498
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
I don't mind at all of course

499
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Decision was made

500
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
2 attack

501
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
What

502
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
We called The Gatekeepers

503
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Of American adults

504
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
This is Charles Silverstein he was at

505
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
Young therapist in training with the flyer

506
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
Vanessa Jeri he was gay

507
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Was part of a growing movement of activist

508
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
They were targeting people like Jerry

509
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
The behaviorist

510
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Have a different point of view

511
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Unlike the Freudian weirdos

512
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Their scientists

513
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
I would say

514
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
He said the public trust at the behavior therapy

515
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
They had a lot of

516
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,728
What's this way over public opinion so if they could convince Jerry and his colleagues

517
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,056
That homosexuality was not something to eat the cured

518
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
Maybe the public would go along

519
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
The question was how do you do that

520
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
How do you make the case

521
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,136
This was around the time when gay activist would start

522
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
Zapping meetings where they basically go to a conference with therapist for meeting

523
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,632
Storm an event grab the mic and just take over

524
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
Charlie's

525
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
Sense with this Gonzo approach

526
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Was not going to convince

527
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
The people that need a convincing

528
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,760
Like sharing so when he approached Jerry after that Workshop very polite

529
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,136
And friendly simply handed him a flyer said hey mean if you folks are doing a thing come by

530
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Tracy just had a sense

531
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
His heart was in the right place

532
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
So we thought maybe I'll take a different project

533
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
I remember looking at the flyer

534
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
And seeing

535
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
I wish those radical gay activist all these troublemakers

536
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Man I've been called in Mike

537
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
We haven't called a natzi

538
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Fascist

539
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
So I remember looking at the flyer

540
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,712
Say to myself well there's no way I'm going to go to this

541
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,320
So he shoved the flower in his pocket yeah I wasn't interested went off to the next panel

542
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
The following day finally the conference

543
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Sunday morning checked out of the hotel

544
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
And I was on my way to

545
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
Leave Penn Station to go back out

546
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Stony Brook

547
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
He says on his way out he kept bumping into colleagues were like hey great Workshop love to Playboy therapy thing

548
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,568
Until we stop wechat and at one point I looked at my watch

549
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
You realized

550
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
I could not make it down to Penn Station

551
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
And I thought

552
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
How the next train doesn't leave Uno

553
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:43,648
3 hours later sending had some time to kill and for whatever reason the thought popped into his head

554
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
The kid from Rutgers with a flyer maybe I'll go

555
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Because I pulled out the

556
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
The flyer he gave me

557
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
I hadn't thrown it away

558
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
And I found the room

559
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Anna went to the room

560
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
And it was a madhouse

561
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,152
Choke the room was Electric in the sense that it was absolutely packed

562
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,064
Charlie and two other gay therapist run stage there may be a few hundred people in the audience of the woodlands family Incredibles 2

563
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
Fayette never heard

564
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
A gay person

565
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,720
I mean a baby seem gay people interrupting attention but never

566
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Take Park

567
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
ISO in my

568
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:25,888
Hollywood imagination of this moment people are shouting they're waving no no no no

569
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
Charlie says this time he worked very hard to keep

570
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Professional respectful

571
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
So it's at 2 it's it's

572
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Cordial

573
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
But fierce

574
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
I was at the top of my phone

575
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
When it came time for him to speak

576
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Charlie says he took aim

577
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
That idea hit her

578
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
People like Jerry repeat

579
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Over

580
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
I only work with people want to change what's the

581
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
What's the big deal

582
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
That idea

583
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Usually said that

584
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
We asked them to read the remarks

585
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Discussion of mail

586
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
Homosexual

587
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
To suggest

588
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,496
The person comes voluntarily to change your sexual orientation

589
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Is to ignore

590
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,336
Powerful Environmental

591
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
Stress oppression if you will that has been telling him

592
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
For years that he should change

593
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,320
To grow up in the family where the word homosexual was whisper

594
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,928
To play in the playground and hear the words faggots and queer

595
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
To go to church and Harrison

596
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
And then to college

597
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,120
And here of illness and finally to the counseling center

598
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
That promises

599
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Cure

600
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,032
Is hardly to create an environment of freedom and voluntary choice

601
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
What brings them into the Counseling Center is guilt shame and the loneliness that comes from there

602
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
If you really wish to help them freely choose

603
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,136
I suggest you first desensitize them to that guilt

604
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
After that it's listening to us but not before

605
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,560
I don't know any more than you what would happen

606
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,656
But I think the choice would be more voluntary and free

607
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
And it is

608
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Yes those are my

609
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Do you remember how those words hurt you

610
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
How it affected me very deeply

611
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Affected me very deeply

612
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
Jerry says he went to Penn Station

613
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
O'Charley's

614
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
Speech into the counseling

615
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
What is scale

616
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Echoing in his mind

617
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,264
52058 Broadway to 517 on the train back Stony Brook

618
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,176
Sat there staring out the window at the scenery thinking thank you

619
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
So I was running through the whole talk

620
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,088
In my head

621
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,744
He says by the time he got to Stony Brook

622
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
He felt something change in him

623
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,144
I went to school the following day

624
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
I know I began

625
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Talk to people about what

626
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
I have just heard it

627
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
The convention

628
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,336
And how it's got me to thinking

629
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,480
Jesus teaching a series of undergraduate classes at that time and he would get up in front of the classes in for the first time think

630
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
What if some of these students are

631
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
In the closet

632
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
Talking to people

633
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
Mulling things over talking to students

634
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
I began to think no

635
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
What I've been doing

636
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
Was absolutely wrong

637
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
Meanwhile his film on the Playboy therapy was still making the rounds still gaining converts

638
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Love the film

639
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
The film have been out

640
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
4 year already

641
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
And by the time the film began to be shown

642
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
I was already

643
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Wishing that

644
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
Wasn't being shown that I had no clue

645
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Control over

646
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
1973

647
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
Couple months after that convention Jerry gets nominated

648
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,256
As the president of the aabt the gigantic organization that had

649
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Thrown the conference he just attended

650
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Becomes one of the youngest president ever

651
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
The following year

652
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
He was due to give the presidential

653
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Address

654
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
This is where things come to a head

655
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,872
Conference that you was held in Chicago it came at a time

656
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
A break

657
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Forever and

658
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Foment

659
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
He says in the days and months leading up to the conference

660
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
People on

661
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
The radical left were calling us fascists and Nazis

662
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,464
And they were publishing circulars were their home addresses

663
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
Someone publish your home address absolutely

664
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
We had the high was president of the association of time

665
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Remember we all had walkie talkies

666
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
And

667
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
We hired

668
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
Plain-clothes people in Chicago Police

669
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
Because we were that afraid of violent

670
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,224
Set the scene when you give the speech how big is the room big big room

671
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Big Ballroom

672
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Mm

673
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
These are all therapists

674
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Yeah

675
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,136
And how are you feeling before the speech very nervous

676
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Terrifying

677
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,304
He says before the talk he'd actually met Charlie at a diner and told them about the species

678
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Remember him saying

679
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,728
You know that your reputation may suffer but have to remember that in those days

680
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
If you said something positive about a homosexual

681
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,408
People will suspect you people may think that you're gay oh he must

682
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,736
Okay that's why you saying he warned me he warned me

683
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
Colleagues and my friends

684
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,536
I want to make plane if not perfectly clear

685
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
That I am speaking only for myself

686
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,728
On an ethical issue that impinges imported Leon artherapy Enterprise

687
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
Jerry began to talk by telling the audience I wish today to voice some concerns I have been wrestling with for over 3 years

688
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
That he's troubled surrounding the way Behavior therapist

689
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,272
And for that matter all other therapists

690
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
Heaven approaching homosexuality

691
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
Did he like a lot of the therapist in the audience

692
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
We have been approached by client

693
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Gay men mostly

694
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
Who want their help

695
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
We made straight to us that they are troubled by their homosexual Behavior or feeling

696
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
But then he asks Silverstein's question

697
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
What is it actually mean

698
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
To help you

699
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,944
A Silverstein put it at the aabt convention two years ago in a discussion of male homosexuality

700
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Let me court again

701
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,856
To suggest that person comes voluntarily to change his sexual orientation

702
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:43,744
Environmental stress oppression if you will

703
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
It has been telling him for years that he should change

704
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Super All in the Family where the word homosexual

705
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
Play who did you in that speech what was la

706
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
That's quite please consider me the code from Silverstein

707
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,896
What drinks stain

708
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,456
And the loneliness that comes from their secret

709
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,552
Another word Silverstein's suggest that we must go back in the causal Network

710
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
And ask ourselves as determinists

711
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
What are the determinants of the client asserting to you

712
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
That he or she wants to change

713
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,376
Jerry that delivers the simple point which is that the problem that these people are asking us to solve

714
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
Is the problem we created

715
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
That we labeled

716
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
As a problem

717
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,712
And tell even if we could affect certain changes

718
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
There is still the more important question of whether we should

719
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
I believe we should not

720
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
To us now

721
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Too many of us now

722
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,912
That may sound like kind of a simple easy obvious

723
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Thing to say

724
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
Say everybody else was arguing

725
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Is that the attempt

726
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
2 Chainz sucks

727
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
Sexual orientation

728
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Ended in failure

729
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
That was not what

730
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Keep that he did something

731
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Quite different

732
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
He said

733
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
And that's me

734
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
It makes no difference

735
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
How successful the treatment is

736
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Is is

737
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Immoral

738
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Charlie says he was the

739
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,960
First person to say that to ever say

740
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,776
That trying to change sexual orientation was in

741
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
Immoral things

742
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:40,480
And that's not a trivial thing

743
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,320
That's one of the early Tremors in a tectonic shift

744
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
Manchester view but all of science like science to that point

745
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
Concerned itself with objectivity

746
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
That was all that mattered

747
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
We stand apart from the world

748
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
And we examine it as it is

749
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
Objectively but that

750
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
From this moment for it would start to be questioned all over the place

751
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
Even in places like mental illness

752
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
You know you look at history

753
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,968
You see that some diseases come and go

754
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Why would that be

755
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,088
People will begin to argue that even mental illnesses

756
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:23,744
Are social constructs created by the society by the people who study them

757
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
With Jerry was doing here

758
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:32,192
He was Shifting the language he was saying forget

759
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,008
Objectivity forgetting bulshit empiricism

760
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Let's talk about that

761
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
Let's talk about morality

762
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
We shouldn't do this

763
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
Not because it doesn't work which it doesn't

764
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Because it's wrong

765
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,928
I hope and I recommend that we continue to devote the necessary energy

766
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
To the important shower

767
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Thank you

768
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
You right about that moment like as you were talking about how like the air

769
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
Felt in that moment you right

770
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,480
Friends commented afterwards that one gets that kind of Silence when everyone in a room full of 1000

771
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
People stops breathing at

772
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
At the same time

773
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Yeah yeah

774
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Exactly right

775
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
I remember that

776
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
I just remember

777
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
That intellect what are they going to do

778
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
When I say this

779
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
And it turned out

780
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
That what they were doing was holding their breath

781
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,520
Did you eventually clap

782
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,384
But afterwards Terry says at the reception

783
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
You walked in and it was like parting the Red Seas

784
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,808
Nobody wants to talk to they're all looking at me and I remember

785
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
One person I will not name him

786
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,280
He came over to me and shook my hand and he bent over and give me a kiss on the cheek what didn't

787
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,144
You like that because you said those things

788
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah and I said

789
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
I said screw you

790
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
So it took a while

791
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
Gypsum board

792
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
They did start to come around

793
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
And get on the right side of History

794
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,320
It's not a straight line by any means but there is a line

795
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
You can draw between Charlie's words coming out of Jerry's mouth and the epically huge decision that these psychiatric community

796
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
As a whole would make

797
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,864
To remove homosexuality as a mental illness from the DSM that big

798
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Bible mental illness

799
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
Siri speech happened right at that beginning

800
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
When science was just starting to wash its hands of the whole idea of

801
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
What's interesting

802
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:56,832
I fine just as one final thought you could read this entire story as a as a sort of Prelude

803
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,696
Psychotherapist were basically ready to say that homosexuality was not an illness

804
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Bible 1986

805
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
That is precisely

806
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
The time when the Christian Community

807
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Walked in

808
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
And grab Vuitton

809
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
The scientific communities

810
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,312
We're accepting homosexuality and they were saying that it's not a disorder anymore

811
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,384
They were removing it from the DSM 3 which is why we need

812
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
To do what we're doing because Christians have to fight the battle Christians have to fight this battle homosexual sin

813
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,856
Because the professional counseling Community won't do it anymore

814
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
Still it was very explicit in your mind oh yeah

815
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
Did that that story

816
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:40,096
Is it storming that we eat here in the next episode of unerased which I think we might also play on Radiolab

817
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,704
I hope so because I all of a sudden instead of talking to data

818
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Talking to

819
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Jeans instead of talking to

820
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Chemicals now you're talkin

821
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
To either God or your

822
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Parents

823
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,783
Teachers or your Society or the pressures that are all around you and it gets

824
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
Greeley

825
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Really lonely

826
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
Really really tough

827
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,743
This episode of Radiolab was drawn from unerased

828
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:14,143
The Untold History of conversion therapy in America that series I worked on with books feature Stitcher and lemon house

829
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Conjunction with feature film boy erased

830
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,263
