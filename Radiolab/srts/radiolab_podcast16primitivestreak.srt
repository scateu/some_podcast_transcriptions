1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,840
Are you awake

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,520
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,640
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
We're going to

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,856
Starts with a conversation that I had with Jad a few weeks ago

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
So

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,256
I like medical stories about you through this you know

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
And so I read this website

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Cups that news.com

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Mariah is sort of really it's like a new weather Boston

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Collection of really amazing like medical reporters

12
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
And

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
I will click on surveys that look interesting

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
And there was one about

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
We've just grown embryos

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
Human embryos for a long time in the lab and

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
That was when I read the phrase

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
The 14-day rule for the first time

19
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
It was that

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Apparently there's this thing that you can't grow an embryo in a lab

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Pass 14 days

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,424
Which I didn't even know you could grow in embryonal Abbott all right

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Or the people were

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
Or that

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
I mean I guess I knew IVF

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Happened sure like tattoo babies how long is the average IVF situation how long is an embryo in a dishwasher

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,320
Then I realized I didn't actually even know that either so then I just spun out so like the whole article is just interesting to me cuz I was like

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
I don't know about any of this

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Emily Webster this is radio from today on Radiolab

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm hole into another universe and Robert you're coming with me tell me about the universe

31
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
You're going to want to buy a ticket because in this universe are twins and souls and mice and something called the

32
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Primitive streak and they're all gathered together around a certain rule

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Well you can fertilize an egg to get fertilized

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,584
And then the egg is fertilized egg it multiplies X cell divides so scientists could take it

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
To watch it grow to learn about human development

36
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
But then I have to stop

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Fa14

38
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
That's the rule

39
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Is this a medical kind of thing or science

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,200
Limitations Medical Science in there

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
But philosophy and ethics

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Obviously religion and

43
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Shebang I have water

44
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
I'll take a sip

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Okay are we going to begin with this guy Leroy Walters

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,144
Okay he was an ethicist at Georgetown University now retired

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,752
And to me he started the father of the 14-day rule

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
I never thought of myself

49
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
As the father

50
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
14 day

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
He totally is well

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
We shouldn't forget the context of

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
73

54
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,136
Alright so 1973 Leroy has recently graduated with doctorate in ethics

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
From Yale University and he's settling into his job and it's a Time medicine and ethics

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
Sort of Collision Course

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Yes

58
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Yes

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Good evening

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
January 8th 1973

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Happens is clearly

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
That a

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
Unborn

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Within the meaning of the Constitution but just six months after that decision be issued

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
Go research became of Hot Topic

66
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Name of a testimony

67
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Even an instance of decapitating fetuses and then around the same time

68
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
Guinea pigs the research involving human being

69
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
Civil studies that were done on African American men without their knowledge

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Paralyzed without their informed

71
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Women with intellectual disabilities

72
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
You have all these questions swirling about like

73
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,983
How we feel about the human body whether or not we want to experiment on it what are we protecting what don't we protect

74
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,615
It just sort of this to Whirlwind and

75
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
You are about to see a historic but most relevant for our story

76
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,623
July 25th 1978

77
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
UK wear now

78
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
Incising the uterus itself

79
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Produced

80
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
A child with the aid of in-vitro

81
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Fertilization

82
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,847
The first baby that was born from an embryo that was grown inside of tube

83
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Babies not open her eyes yet

84
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Everyone in the World list

85
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
FastMed

86
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
But there were people

87
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Who predicted Doom

88
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
What was the Doom

89
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,815
In vitro fertilization would lead to

90
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Reproduction is

91
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
Form of manufacturer

92
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
So the government was grappling with

93
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:41,759
We need more regulations or we need as a country to think about like what are ethical guidelines are

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
The department of health education and Welfare

95
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,927
Put together and then call the ethics Advisory Board

96
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Doctors Lehman academic

97
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:56,863
Even a Jesuit priests who consider moral and ethical questions

98
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Human fertilization

99
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
It's meetings and discussions open today

100
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,359
Now as part of those meetings the Border colonies expert Witnesses and one of those Witnesses was our Boy Leroy

101
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
Write the staff director Leroy like

102
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,343
Ethically tell us what we should be thinking about when it comes to embryos we are to regard them

103
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
And he says well there's a spectrum and on the one side You could argue human embryo should be

104
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
Protected from the time of fertilization

105
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Forward

106
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,959
We shouldn't even be growing embryos in a lab at all but then there's the other side

107
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Possession was that

108
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Research could be done until about 8 weeks fetus at about 8 weeks

109
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Can have a reflex

110
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Response

111
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
To a stimulus

112
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
And then

113
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
At some point

114
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,647
A Committee Member turns to Leroy and she says

115
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Where would you draw the line

116
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
A+

117
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
He says well

118
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
I would say for me

119
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
14 days

120
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Y 14

121
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Well Leroy had a couple different arguments

122
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
1 before 14 days 50%

123
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Overly human embryos are simply

124
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Laughter

125
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
They just sort of Shed from the woman's uterus

126
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,623
And don't develop further if we are already losing 50% of them naturally

127
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
We don't have strong moral obligation

128
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Toward early human embryo

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
You can even posted as the

130
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Metaphysical

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
The question

132
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
If these are important beings why do 50

133
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
8% of them

134
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Disappear

135
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
And we never have any knowledge of

136
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
Argument number two

137
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Splatoon 2

138
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
2

139
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,199
As in Twin embryos can recombine

140
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
And a one embryo

141
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
Right right before 14 days and embryo doesn't know if one embryo or vasectomy one person or two people

142
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
So is leer I put it it doesn't have a

143
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
And that happened around 14 days argument number 3

144
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
The Primitives

145
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Streak

146
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Appears

147
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Primitive

148
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Streak the perimeters

149
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Is the

150
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
First indication of a

151
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
An axis

152
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
Of the future body

153
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,431
People see it as I got the body starting to organize

154
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
You might say it's

155
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,855
The outline of the spinal cord that will develop later on the first hint of like

156
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Shape

157
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
All of those seem to kind of

158
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Converge

159
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Around

160
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
14 days

161
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Eventually the committee decides to take Leroy suggestion and recommend that all research on human embryos be stopped

162
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Get 14 days

163
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
With

164
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
High expectations

165
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Since we submitted the report

166
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
The Secretary of health education and Welfare

167
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Joseph califano

168
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
On May 4th

169
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
1970s

170
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
And on July 19th

171
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
1979 before he could be

172
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Respond

173
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Secretary kalifano was fired

174
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
By president

175
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Jimmy Carter

176
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
It was part of a whole cabinet shake-up

177
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
And so

178
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
The report has been sitting on shelves

179
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Gathering

180
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Dust

181
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
And there has never been

182
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
For Maurice

183
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,431
It did end up becoming a guideline in the US It's actually an international guideline but we never actually needed it

184
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,015
Because 14 days that was so far beyond

185
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
The capacity of researchers

186
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,415
The culture early embryos that it also seemed like

187
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Safe

188
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Safe

189
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Marker safe

190
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Foundry

191
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,447
Because and this is the interesting thing with IVF

192
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
We're familiar with 0 1 2 3 4 5

193
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
6

194
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
Which is about the time they put the embryo into the mother

195
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
So nobody is ever really seen how an embryo develops from day 7 through 14

196
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
So interesting you can't

197
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
Photograph it through the body for like various reasons

198
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
For one No One Ever Knows they're pregnant that are really like

199
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,119
When did you and your wife realize your pregnant looks like a month after the fertilization

200
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,239
Yeah it's funny it's like when she ain't you even if you're trying you don't actually know for weeks until

201
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Yeah

202
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,407
And it's so small that even if you did know the way it attaches to the uterus it start

203
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
Burrows in and

204
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Kind of can't see it

205
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,855
At the same time scientists are pretty sure that this is a very important moment in development

206
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
They just can't get to it

207
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Wait wait

208
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
Life Magazine 50 years ago published these gorgeous pictures of

209
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Of a fertilized cell

210
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
And then

211
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
Beautiful little baby with eyes you just

212
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
Yeah but this is a that they have

213
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Pictures of sperms and eggs

214
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Then there's a blank spot until at least three and a half weeks

215
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
So that Magazine spread

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Didn't show

217
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,063
The first Pew II

218
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
In the development of the human being that no scientist has seen

219
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Ever know

220
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
Yeah so this is this kind of. Which in the textbook who would find described as a black box which

221
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Brings us

222
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,519
The Magdalena at the University of Cambridge in UK

223
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,639
Cheat for years have been trying to figure out how to grow embryos during this period

224
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:34,271
But if we're Joseph Spider-Man the problem was at this point the embryo is beginning to attach

225
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
To the mother's uterus and so just need certain things from the mother and if

226
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
You try and grow it in

227
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
A dish

228
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
It just shrivels up and dies

229
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,095
Yes yes so that the time we were trying critias scratch our heads and come up with that Mustang

230
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
Enrichment environment we could imagine

231
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,775
Like maybe I can make a recreate that really warm cozy

232
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Home

233
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
Put in a dish without the mom interesting so so experimented like what is the right

234
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Bath

235
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
At the growing embryo needs it needs

236
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
Yeah and they decided that while they're still trying to figure it out they would just do it on my sombreros first and Sochi

237
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Started essentially just

238
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
Coming up with like chemistry concoctions

239
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
They started with the gel which was of particular elasticity and then they

240
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Made from Human placentas added some hormones like progesterone along with fiber

241
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Escrow factors like someone would sell this is

242
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Looks like a face cream or something

243
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Play even tried serum from that's what I sent us that actually really didn't work.

244
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
For five years they put stuff in everything

245
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,031
I ended up with something at least on my seem to work really well so they thought okay

246
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
Maybe it's time we try this with human embryos

247
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
We took two Andres just two human

248
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Blastocyst

249
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Put them in a dish with their chemical concoction and

250
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Amazing Grace

251
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
It works

252
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
One of them

253
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Ditch maker

254
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
213 days

255
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
The other one didn't but it's right

256
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,191
Suddenly they have an embryo that was growing heffle into date

257
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Deny

258
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Big Ten

259
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
11

260
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
And they were able to see all of these moments in human development that

261
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
No one had ever seen before

262
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
And and guess what Robert

263
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
I got to see them too

264
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Do you want to come of course I want to come okay good Alicia go right now I mean we are going to go

265
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
But we're good actually have to take a break first

266
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
So we'll be back in a bit

267
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Hi this is

268
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103

274
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

275
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
And I'm here because I need your help

276
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
And I request

277
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
For those of you who

278
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

279
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:40,895
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance

280
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Basically I want to hear about this

281
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,247
When a kid you know did something

282
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
It just means you lean back and say

283
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
How do they do that

284
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Maybe it was the moment that I

285
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,231
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

286
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
Or maybe the kid was a piano

287
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,887
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

288
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Or maybe the kids in math class

289
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
Music in the margin of their geometry

290
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
We're interested in the

291
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Epic moments where

292
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
Kid does something super smart

293
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
It doesn't have anything to do with it

294
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
If you have a story

295
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Go to radiolab.org

296
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Flash brilliance

297
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
And record a short audio message

298
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Again that's radiolab.org

299
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Slash brilliant

300
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Thank you so much

301
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
Okay we're back I am Robert krulwich

302
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
I Molly Webster

303
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,943
He is really 11 today the 14-day rule

304
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
Last we left you we had just met a woman who managed to grow a human embryo in a lab write up to the 14-day line

305
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
Now we get to see it right after you promised

306
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Yes

307
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
When your phone on when your phone off

308
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Good luck

309
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
Lucky enough for me there is in embryology lab right here in New York Rockefeller University

310
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
How are you

311
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,847
Run by this guy

312
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Fake being a scientist

313
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
Ollie's team building off of magdalena's work

314
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
Today we're also going human embryos in the lab

315
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
The 40-day mark

316
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,439
So he invited me up to see them seeing something that

317
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
No other human beings has ever seen

318
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Except the group in Islam

319
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
And obviously might just laugh

320
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
How many people are in this lab that you think so.

321
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
I think we're so total 25

322
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
So then I'll be like 26

323
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
So Ali has to step out of the room

324
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
I'm excited but thank you Ali and he passes me off to the guy that runs like the human embryology

325
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
You research at the lab

326
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Craft and a lab technician

327
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Chichirya Pellegrino

328
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
To Julia Pellegrini

329
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Okay

330
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
We go into the lab

331
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
Benches microscopes and people pipetting and

332
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
So

333
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
There's a little sticky on the fridge that says

334
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Experiment 27 embryos here

335
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Entity Leah pulls out like a plastic

336
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
Box that has a blue bottom and like a white opaque top

337
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,967
So they just came off and inside there was kind of like a microscope slide and the embryos were

338
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Attached to that

339
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
There's condensation on us we have to wait like 10 minutes

340
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,927
Weirdly nerves but eventually they like look down into this like

341
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Little

342
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Square well

343
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,119
10 millimeters by 10 mm and I have a little bit of liquid in it

344
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,191
And then inside that liquid

345
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Offices

346
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Human embryo

347
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
How big is it how big is an embryo

348
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
In my mind I do imagine

349
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
A tiny little

350
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
Human isn't even human like at that point

351
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
Tiny. Right there no is just a little white

352
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
.

353
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Really small

354
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
I took a grain of sand

355
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,839
And it looks like I kept also thinking that it look like if you took

356
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
Sheet of typing paper and you took

357
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Pin

358
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,287
Poked a hole in the paper and a little pinpoint of light came through

359
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
That's what it looks like that

360
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
I cannot believe that goes into a

361
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
Five foot nine tall human being

362
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
So that was a day 12 Andrea we were looking at with our naked eye but gets into chili also

363
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Badass microscope

364
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
What do I don't want to break anything

365
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,143
So we could look at a bunch of images and see the development of an embryo day by day

366
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Starting with

367
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Day 8

368
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Right here like you have the embryo man

369
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
What are you

370
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
What is it look like

371
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
It's

372
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Tewksbury lunar 2

373
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Blown-out Grace

374
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
Sphere that has like modeled surfaces

375
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
But inside of it are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cells are primitive endoderm and there's a happy glass

376
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,975
There were like three different types of cells but to me it like looks like a simple structure

377
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
And then

378
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
This is the same embryo the next looks totally different so starts to get a little more complex

379
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,543
Now we can see nuclei there's a nucleus

380
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Make me switch from 9 to 10 so what are those

381
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,599
Droplets now there are these like spiritual balls around the edges and that could be any number of things

382
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
Just think they might be fat and the embryo it starts

383
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Warming like the asymmetry like you see things move to different areas of the cell

384
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Inside

385
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,959
And then your inner gut cavity that starts to form and solve

386
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
A new cell type would never stand the yolk Sac Rebecca Graham cell

387
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
So it's totally new type of cell no one's ever seen before so we don't know where it comes from and neither does anyone else

388
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,087
Damn excited every time you open one of them locate a 11

389
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
They'll abandon really like looks at different to me

390
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
School Daze thirteeners all this brightness at the bottom in the upper left-hand corner

391
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Remind me again the last is that is the cell type from which the entire body

392
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Eventually emerges

393
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
Guest says those are the cells that all of the body comes from like all the other stuff is mostly just support

394
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
So it's like that it's like the Primal like

395
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
Primordial

396
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Yeah

397
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Yeah

398
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,703
So actually got there on day 13 of the experiment so all of the embryos were just sort of

399
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
Waiting to get today 14 and

400
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
That was it

401
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
And then I was just sort of

402
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
Spit back out into the real world

403
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
Are they learning fantastically new amazing things based on this so they're like the the the big take

404
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Play the both of the groups had

405
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Why is that

406
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,792
This embryo glue for another week without any maternal input

407
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
And it grew basically as it should have

408
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
Which was mind-blowing to me into all of my colleagues

409
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
That the human embryo

410
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
Will behave in a self-organizing manner

411
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
In the complete absence of maternal input

412
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
At least for 14 days

413
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
Like I think they always thought

414
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
Even if they got the chemistry right there be some sort of system breakdown because it wasn't getting imp

415
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
From the mall

416
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:52,256
Interesting ways I keep thinking of it is like the anti Mother's Day message

417
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Camera doesn't need you happy Mother's day but the edges the one pro promo

418
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
Saying is by the way by the end

419
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
In between day like 12

420
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
14 and became

421
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Clear that it started meeting

422
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
The Eternal Empire

423
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Well so they always cool was like they saw that the embryo start

424
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Deforming

425
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
Tunnels and Pathways for the mom to like

426
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,256
Infiltrate but there were little tubes and Pathways of foreign war like nerve attachment could happen

427
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
And like circulation

428
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
Sewage pipe repairs itself in this week

429
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,960
The mom and the connection really cool it's like

430
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Play cooking itself up to the network

431
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
I know it's funny as I coming online is like a human being

432
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
The cool thing was

433
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,064
Guess told me that right around Dayton along the edges of the embryo

434
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,952
This hormone shows up that your body had doesn't have before it's called like a gonadotropin

435
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Do you know when you take a pregnancy test

436
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,328
The thing is reading is that hormone

437
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Is that

438
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
He thinks like

439
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
The embryo Broadcasting

440
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,288
Cyclone boom boom mic out to the rest of the body

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
Like I'm here I'm here look at this hormone

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
Wow that's super cool

443
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,064
What is it like to look through a microscope and see

444
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Day 8

445
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
When we've been stopped at day 7 since

446
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
The 1970s or day 9 or 10

447
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
It's hard to describe it

448
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
When people receive

449
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,168
The digital image of the Hubble telescope

450
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
First uri's

451
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Who are getting it in the screens

452
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,384
I guess it has to be something but he seemed enough for that

453
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
When I look inside

454
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
409a attorney at the time where

455
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Nobody knows

456
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
Even exist

457
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
Is the same as

458
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Looking at dimensions

459
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Never imagined

460
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,304
Whatever see because we didn't even know they exist

461
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
But then at day 14 you have

462
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
To essentially embalming

463
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,712
You like, I can make it stop growing and

464
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
Freeze in the place it's at

465
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,344
They caught fixing but if they wanted to we could they go past 14 days

466
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Maybe but

467
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,464
Ali he said that as I got closer to day 14 they noticed

468
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Changes in the embryo that made it

469
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
Clear that it started needing more than just a current Bassett it was in

470
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Okay

471
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,984
Like embreeville Lou says it's 2 in Magdalena says it's like everyday feels like an accomplishment

472
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Oh my gosh I grew another day and then you start like

473
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Sharing it on

474
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,176
Another day another day oh my gosh here to 12

475
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Becomes like your life

476
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Champion

477
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
And then you're like

478
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:00,928
Stop you're done and I felt like when I was standing there was like oh that's a bra

479
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Because

480
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
I wanted it to grow grow grow grow grow

481
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
But he said don't want it to grow grow grow too far

482
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
So is like

483
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
Curry 15 16 when does the joy of my voice stop

484
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Eventually

485
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,224
That's uncomfortable this is something that

486
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Touches Us in The Roots

487
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Overtone definition

488
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,648
So far being in existence and individuality

489
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
Tecumseh like a Pandora box

490
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
So

491
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,072
Yes you would open it but you have to be ready

492
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
To see what's in it

493
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,752
If technology has no moved it a whole nother week so we can go for 14 days

494
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:51,360
Maybe it's pretty soon you can go a whole nother week and then home other week

495
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Does that mean the rules going to have to change

496
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
That is a conversation that's happening right now

497
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
This research was published there were commentaries and articles and columns

498
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
Songs about what do we do about the 14-day Rule and there's

499
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,072
Conferences are competent Boston that's happening in the fall

500
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Like you could choose

501
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
Could do any number of things it depends on where you sort of throw down a biological or moral marker that you feel come

502
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Comfortable with like you can keep it at 14 days instead of keep it around like this idea of twinning and The Primitives

503
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
You could move it a week out to say the day 21 when there's interesting sort of neural phone

504
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,648
Folds in divisions that are starting to happen in the brain

505
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
You could go to 8 weeks

506
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,232
But it could also go back to zero

507
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:44,352
There's no consensus on the scientists are the first to say like

508
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,912
They don't want to make this decision

509
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,520
They just think maybe we should have this conversation as a group so the

510
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Society decides not us

511
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:59,712
So yeah and then we'll just like if you say that like this amazing is like the Hubble telescope how did it feel

512
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
When you're like I've gotten this far and now I have to end it

513
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
So that's the toughest question you can ask me today

514
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
For me for sure

515
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Who was important

516
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
2

517
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Stop the experiment

518
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
Where there was still a message that you could convey

519
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
That would not offend people

520
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
This is more than just saying

521
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
What is the

522
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
British an engine

523
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
Reproductive biology especially in human reproductive biology

524
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
To make sure that you don't know fans

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
People sensitive

526
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Identity dignity

527
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Religion

528
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
So Ali he finds himself

529
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,328
Trying to keep all of these different perspectives in his head

530
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
All at once

531
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
So. Lifted the Catholic point of view is

532
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,032
Human Origins perception then I have to respect also the Jewish point of view

533
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
That's just you know what is a harpy

534
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Also

535
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
Respect the Muslim point of view about the origin of human life

536
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:07,040
Which surprisingly for one seems to be similar than the Jewish point of view is also heart piece

537
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,624
I wish I could respect the Buddhist point of view

538
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
And what about the Hindus

539
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
The booty says if you don't cut the umbilical cord when you're not independent you're not a human being called an organic human being

540
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Asian deuces

541
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
I don't know what you guys are talking about

542
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
There is no

543
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Origin or ends

544
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
What are circles within circles within circles

545
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
