1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,840
Is Jad Radiolab so

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,912
We're at the here is a show we originally released

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
About

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,264
Six seven years ago we decided to revisit a trees

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Mind

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Style started off

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
I'll say more about it

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
Are you weightless

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,648
Listening to Radiolab

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,768
Radio WNYC

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
Okay ready alright let's open the show today

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
Test test on a sunny street corner

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
New Jersey where are we now we are on Washington Street which is the main thoroughfare in Hoboken

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
It's a nice day in Hoboken people are out and about after work

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,136
Name is John Horgan I'm a science journalist he's also a teacher

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,952
And John is out today with our producer Lulu Miller

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Doing

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,864
What do you often does wishes to go up to someone he doesn't know

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,008
Only take a minute at moment and I can give you

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
Will humans ever stop fighting Wars once and for all

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
No

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Because of

23
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Greed

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
And one UPS

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
To explain John's been asking this question

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Will humans ever stop fighting wars

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
What's 4 years

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
These are him this question

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
Snapchat about war get something really Bass

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Do we feel we can change

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Who We Are

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,032
Any kind of popped out of his mouth was 2003

33
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
In a friend asked him to give a talk at a church just a few days after the first invasion of Iraq

34
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
So here I was in this

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,088
Church and I remember the mood was very somber

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,928
I was determined to try to make people

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Feel that okay

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
This is a setback but still

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
You got to believe that this is possible and I try to list all the reasons

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,728
Hennessy was making his case and getting worked up

41
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
You look at the 60 or so people were there in the audience is that all right

42
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
How many of you here believe that war

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Will and someday

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
And I think one or two people raise their hand at a 60

45
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,672
And John thought way

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
This is really Who You Are

47
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
And so that's actually when I started

48
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Reading as much as I can about all these things and dug up some surveys from the 1980s

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Sounds about 20 years ago

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
People were asking this question

51
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
You think war will ever end taking surveys

52
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
A snowman that they were not the most scientific

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
But like the results

54
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Seem to indicate

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
That we used to be optimistic

56
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Back in the 80s only one and three

57
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Got that work

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Is a minority

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Where is today

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Will Youmans ever stop fighting Wars once and for all if you take that question to the streets of Hoboken

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:21,472
You'll find love about nine out of 10 people

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
Saying yeah I think so

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
Never know

64
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
Might be called up John again recently to ask

65
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
Have the results change cuz he has

66
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
Kept on doing a survey and he said no

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
6 years later it's

68
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,208
Still roughly eight or nine out of ten people say no we'll never stop fighting

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Same results

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Depressingly

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
The worst part

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Is it when he asked the next

73
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Why do you think

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Invariably he gets

75
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,312
Something like I think there is a human nature is to for greed and to always want more it's just

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Human Nature

77
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:09,600
And I don't think we're ever going to learn why do you say that I just think that it's too ingrained in our human nature

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
So

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
So

80
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
So

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
So

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
So we want to challenge that last day

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Too ingrained in our human nature that was handed down to us

84
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
From our primate ancestors violence meme

85
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Who knows

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Question is

87
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
How ingrained is that

88
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Well yeah

89
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,639
Me if you think that we have inherited something yet what can we do about it we Stocker can we change

90
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Phoenix Wright choices

91
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,783
So he's got for you this hour or three stories where choice

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Individual choice

93
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Challenges destiny

94
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Maybe

95
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,975
I'm Jared I'm right by Robert krulwich this is Radiolab

96
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Stick around

97
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Here's the thing

98
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Did not mean the present

99
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
This show was

100
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,151
Are usually inspired by an anecdote that I'd read about the New York Times is Guy Martin bunzl

101
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Was telling a story

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,575
When he was 18 it was 1966 I believe you sitting on a plane and a guy next to him

103
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Sad looks

104
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
The stewardess and then says

105
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Not another negro stewardess

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Something like that

107
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Sky Martin buns over by the way the classroom

108
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
He says

109
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Thinking back on it

110
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
That was an interesting thing

111
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Because

112
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
Had that guy on the plane said that a few years earlier would have been like

113
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Commonplace

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Had he said it a few years later

115
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
It would have been intolerable the right then

116
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
It was neither

117
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
It was things were shifting

118
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
And he said

119
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,439
You know it was like this guy was shouting through an open window Between Worlds

120
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
That was his praise

121
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Open window Between Worlds

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Totally lodged in my head

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
And I've been thinking about that phrase a lot

124
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
This feeling that maybe the ground is Shifting beneath our feet not quite sure

125
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
And that's actually what brought us back to the show that feeling

126
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
Is each of the stories in this

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Show

128
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Kind of suggests that

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Window Between Worlds

130
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,319
So what we going to do is as a redo the show after a couple of stores are going to check in real quick

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Whether we feel like we passed

132
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Through this window into a new world or whether we're still

133
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Stuck in the Middle

134
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
You just you just heard Lulu Miller

135
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
I briefly in art and that last few minutes

136
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
She at the time with our producer now of course she is

137
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Become Superstar host of invisibilia

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Damn

139
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
To the show began with

140
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
A familiar voice

141
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Remember this guy Roberts

142
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Sapolsky

143
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Robert sapolsky

144
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,391
We've had on the show couple times he's a neuroscientist spends most of the year at Stamper unilab

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
Rat scientist doing the real biology in the lab

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
In the Summers

147
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,375
How am I going to spend time in East Africa in the Serengeti studying while Bevins there

148
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
Why you but it was you working now

149
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
Season 2 this is interested in studying stress

150
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,103
Effects stress has on the body and turns out baboons

151
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Are perfect

152
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Source of data

153
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Because

154
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
They're always under

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,807
You know the one thing we know about baboons on forever

156
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
Is it a fight baboons constantly not just metaphorically but literally have been V

157
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Textbook example of a highly aggressive male-dominated hierarchical Society

158
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Crosby's animals hunt because they live in these aggressive troops on the Savannah parentheses

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
Like we humans used to invest we evolve very similar like they have a constant Baseline level of aggression

160
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,759
Which inevitably spills over into their social life

161
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Which is why he's

162
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
So what's supposed to be does basically he goes into the bush

163
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Any watches

164
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
More than they are in a whole sale today. This is covered with these field notebook

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Each one containing detailed notes

166
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,239
Who groom who and who's not getting along with who and who's messing around with who in the bushes

167
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,847
He tells the following story of a particular moment in his baboon watching

168
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Which completely

169
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Changed his life

170
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
James how he sees the world it happened about 30 years ago

171
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Supposed to be the young guy just out of grad school

172
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Settings first troop might

173
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
My first Baton Rouge

174
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
True. We love these rare animals I was very

175
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Connected with

176
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
The most ways a pretty average group or basic

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Baboon Troop

178
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
The females were highly affiliated with each other

179
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,751
They had a very stable ranking system the males meanwhile

180
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,847
Highly aggressive dumping on each other cuz that's just what males do

181
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Right

182
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
Okay mid-80s

183
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
A big boom in tourism in Kenya of Wonders for the economy lot Sanu lodges lot to Lodge expansions

184
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,791
And there happened to be the next territory over the tourist Lodge in this one particular Lodge

185
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
She says he's gotten really big

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Really fast

187
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
And during the time the lodge greatly expanded their garbage dumped me they stated they just dug a hole out behind the

188
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
A large when you stay a tractor came out

189
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
With the leftovers and dumped it there

190
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,271
So we're talking about here if you can easily imagine is he big steaming pile of

191
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
Trash half-eaten Food baking in the Sun

192
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
Smell wafting in the breeze

193
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,255
From miles and miles and into the nostrils of baboons everywhere

194
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
So

195
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
It was not long before a troop of baboons

196
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Possible

197
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,935
When your boss covered the garbage and just order cheating on it

198
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
I hear there are eating leftover

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
Desert Sun

200
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,639
Chicken whatever is done

201
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Dumb full of

202
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Food must be to a baboon like

203
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Like wandering into

204
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Manna in the wilderness

205
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,647
So this troop almost immediately shifted their entire Behavior

206
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,791
2 they just slept in the trees above the garbage dump and instead of getting up at 6 in the morning to start forging

207
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Are they would waddle down around

208
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,215
2 minutes of mine and the tractor would show up at 9 and dump the food and they would have

209
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,055
20 minutes of sheer Frenzy

210
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
And then they go back to sort of being couch potatoes

211
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
And this is how it went for a while

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
So they're over there

213
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Living off of garbage

214
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
And

215
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Somehow some of the males in my troop figure this out

216
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Ismael's think

217
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
We got to get in on this

218
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
We got to go over there

219
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
And take their food what emerged was each morning a bunch of males would run a kilometer or so

220
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
The garbage dump in fight their way in

221
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
So every morning there be a showdown

222
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,455
I'm basically yeah they would come back with canine slashes and stuff like that and fat but also have

223
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Drumsticks

224
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Cakes

225
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Hamburgers

226
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
This ritual

227
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Accessible C1 on for year and then

228
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
You years into it

229
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,535
I got word that there were a couple of baboons in this garbage dump Troop

230
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:20,191
That looked awful and something was wrong with him these guys from Elijah called him and said hey you better get down here and look at this and

231
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
When you got there

232
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
What he saw

233
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,359
Was horrible animals with rotting hands walking on their elbows

234
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
So

235
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,551
Trying to figure out what this is about get veterinarians involved when we finally figure out is tuberculosis

236
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,647
Infected meat have been thrown in the dump and then eaten by the baboons

237
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
And this is really bad news

238
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Because well tuberculosis in people

239
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,095
Is it really slow moving disease he be kills non-human primates in weeks

240
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
And it's a nightmare of a disease

241
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
For them in just a short time

242
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
The garbage dump Troop

243
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Was completely decimate

244
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Not to mention the tough guys in sapolsky

245
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
The ones that have gone to the dump every morning

246
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,247
They got two of the same kind of rotting hands and they all died

247
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
That must have been really

248
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Kind of tragic

249
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Not

250
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Good. For me

251
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
These were my animals

252
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Grown up with these guys

253
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
But yeah while sapolsky was heartbroke

254
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Now that half

255
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
The alpha male

256
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Super Dad

257
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
He didn't notice

258
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Strange things start to happen

259
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Change is harder than well grooming spiked and I sit on a branch and I take

260
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Please out of here

261
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,463
Be as well either usually when a female Grooms of a male the male is never received

262
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
But suddenly they were

263
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,143
Even weirder you saw a adult male sitting in contact with each other and grooming each other

264
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
It helped how rare that is

265
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,799
Be like it from something in the middle of round 5 of a heavyweight bout

266
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Mike Tyson just decided to stop boxing and Evander Holyfield hair

267
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
If you were babbling all legit it would have been less shocking if these guys had wings

268
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Door were photosynthetic or something up to then I've seen like 30 seconds of male male grooming the corset

269
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
15 years but at the time supposed to be kind of wrote it off this is just some freak event wasn't going to last

270
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Sookie actually stop studying

271
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Non natural event removing half the study subjects

272
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,527
Scientist became less interesting to you know that was the rationale it was just too painful to go on walks

273
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
These guys

274
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
So I moved to the other end of the reserve

275
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Like 40 miles away and started with a new troop there are an for 6 years I would not go anywhere near the corner of the power

276
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Park is I just

277
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Be there

278
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Fast forward

279
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
6 years

280
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
We come to the MoMA

281
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
That really change things

282
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
Strand really flipped him into a different way

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
And it happened

284
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Kind of bags

285
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,663
It's about 6 years later out there

286
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
For the first time with

287
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,527
Who was destined to become my wife and

288
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Decided I wanted a kind of show her where

289
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,999
I am grown-up what part of the part I'm going to go to the old haunt yeah basically she went there

290
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
And the truth was there and they were acting pretty much the same as before lots of grooming not so much fighting isn't that

291
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
Nice and they're still like this great Remnant true

292
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Just pointing out all the different baboons are there

293
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Steven

294
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Whoever

295
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
And then it

296
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Hixson

297
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Houston or whatever

298
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,295
There was only one male left

299
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
We've been there at the time of the TB outbreak

300
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
One meal

301
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Stick with me for just one second and you will go

302
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
The thing about male baboons

303
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Christian artists

304
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Hands around puberty

305
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
The Mills get a little ants

306
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
I get itchy

307
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
They're bored and they just pick up and leave

308
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,591
So in a troop any of the adult males grew up someplace else which meant these new guys at work

309
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
We're coming into

310
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Sapolsky Stroup

311
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
Coming in from the outside from the old world order jerky real dog-eat-dog world out there

312
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
What's he got to figure these new mails are coming in

313
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
Withhold expectations that they're going to have to kick ass

314
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
To be respected which would mean

315
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
This whole Kumbaya

316
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
Situation should

317
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Evaporate

318
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
The moment these guys show up

319
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
But it didn't

320
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
It's stuck

321
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Oh my God

322
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
The new guys are learning we don't do stuff like that here

323
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,551
You guys are learning a new way will that means the old way the violent way

324
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Isn't the only way

325
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
This this lured me was one of those moments

326
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
Will be one of the three or four that sign for once in my life

327
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
The key question was how do these guys unlearn their entire

328
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Fire childhood culture of aggression blah blah and somehow learned we don't do

329
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Stuff like that around here

330
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Wow

331
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,831
Well what will how do they unlearn something that was supposedly built in oh

332
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Midas Moline

333
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
But but here's

334
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Sapolsky

335
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Ears

336
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
And this is really going may have to do

337
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
With that

338
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
Precarious moment when the new guy comes

339
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
Now normally what happens in this order status quo

340
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
Is it the new guy arrives and it's

341
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
That really bad

342
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
It's awful

343
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
Can you look at them and eat just identify with

344
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Like freshman year of college or something

345
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
They're completely peripheral every male whose higher-ranking dumps on them

346
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
Baboon is completely ignored by the lady who just sit there

347
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,511
Somebody groom him my God I went to sophomore year until

348
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,815
Somebody groom him come on

349
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Why don't they

350
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
Cuz they did some adult male would have attacked them hopetown ladies hang back while he's out there biting and

351
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
Incline and trying to scratch his way and we've got here

352
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,919
Is a cycle that is a good tip for a long long time

353
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
But if you make one small change just remove the alpha male take him out of the equation

354
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
Suddenly the females are more relaxed and more likely to take a social gamble of reaching out to some

355
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
Somebody new the key thing is the females

356
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Early enough everything's different remarkable in your typical true

357
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,151
3 months on the average before the first female rooms in this true

358
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
6 days

359
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Can I out 6 days a week

360
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Compared to 3 month

361
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,367
Yeah and a world in which from day one as an adolescent male you're treated better

362
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
Something about the aggressiveness melts away

363
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
The thing though is Jabba.

364
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Before we get too carried away would you have to ask

365
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
The question just how permanent is

366
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
Change is

367
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,567
As nice as it is so I explain this whole story that you just told

368
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
To a professor at Harvard named Richard wrangham

369
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
Brother innov-is hear music evolutionary biologist

370
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Annie's chips

371
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Particularly

372
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,087
But you have to know okay you heard the story about the baboons

373
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
What do you think

374
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
You'll know it's a nice example of the

375
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
Potential for some change

376
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Actually we should put on resume

377
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
Let you know lots of balloons have been started across town

378
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
And this sort of example is never been found in a natural

379
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Context

380
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
But I just happened to put a garbage dump

381
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
Text to have humans provide food the

382
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Leads to

383
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Several mail.

384
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,575
That means that I could imagine going on a helicopter all over Africa shooting all the alpha males

385
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
I've been giving all the ladies at

386
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
A chance to

387
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,743
Create a different baboon culture and me when I guess I'm wondering is do you think

388
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,607
An absurd situation like that the baboonery might change it

389
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Its essential nature

390
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
I don't think it'll change it to sensual nature I can see that that can be

391
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
A cultural influence

392
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
That may lost a little bit of time

393
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
But the larger info

394
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Clearly is the session of

395
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
A genes that produce a particular kind of brain

396
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,599
A baboon is basically a baboon until you get some kind of

397
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Genetic China

398
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
That is

399
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Something good

400
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Supposed to

401
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
So Professor running

402
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
A genetic change

403
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,375
To make sure that this is really real permanent and here's the thing

404
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,959
I know this constitutes a genetic change but it has been 20

405
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Years

406
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Real yes

407
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
20 years in sapolsky original baboon troop is

408
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Still

409
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Operating in this

410
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Even though dozens of new mail

411
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Elsa come and go

412
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Any idea

413
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Something that was

414
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Miso

415
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Unchanged

416
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Could change

417
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
And change quickly

418
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
And then State change

419
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
As a result of something so

420
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
Arie and undefinable is culture will that

421
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
It's caused Robert sapolsky

422
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Dare I say it

423
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
2

424
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Absolutely understand

425
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Something that I Do by

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
By Nature

427
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,335
No not at all if you think this syllable

428
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Decided

429
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,431
To send it to Foreign Affairs magazine

430
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
The magazine read by a lot of politicians

431
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Still

432
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
They went for it

433
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
And so we had to ask him after it was published

434
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Did anyone

435
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Write you back

436
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
No basically not

437
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,375
I basically heard nothing from anyone now

438
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
Yes big yawning silence

439
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
III

440
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
I'm sure George Bush and Cheney

441
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,383
Rita teach evening and tremble at his implication

442
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
No basically as far as I can tell it was a huge waste of time for me to write it

443
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Well we're at it

444
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
My mother didn't even

445
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Alright so

446
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
7 years

447
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Past as we've mentioned and so we say

448
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Decided that it was only right for us.

449
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
The catch up with rabbits

450
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,960
Hello hello

451
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,288
You know we're trying to close a window here to

452
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Increasing noise

453
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
We found him in a very odd place

454
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
Actually a for a Baboons

455
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
Play this in the library of the middle school with

456
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
A bunch of kids outside

457
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,464
How did that happen cuz wife now directs the musical theater Productions

458
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
So

459
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
Somehow I'm playing piano is rehearsal pianist at this

460
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
School with the musical

461
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
We are doing Oliver this year

462
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Really

463
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
I just had nothing to do with me or queso

464
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Anyway so

465
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
I told Robert that we talked to Richard wrangham reminded him

466
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,272
Ryan says no no baboons are hardwired to be a certain way in

467
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
And circumstances never going to change them in

468
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Yep

469
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
He and I are

470
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
This isn't the first time we've

471
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Disagreed

472
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,792
And I think we probably had a we shall see sort of finish

473
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
So what what have we seen since you guys talked about what's been happening yeah what's been happening as well they were

474
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
A few possibilities

475
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
There's

476
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
One scenario where

477
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,384
It could have turned into exactly what was

478
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
Being predicted there which was that the

479
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Troopers go back to you

480
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Being a

481
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,576
Typical highly aggressive baboon Troop

482
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,904
The other possibility is the one that I was always like

483
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Dreaming of

484
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Which is

485
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
So you're a

486
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Kid who's grown up in that

487
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
True band you

488
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Grown up on the Communists are and

489
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Along Comes puberty and it's time for you to

490
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
To pick up and you move to a different route

491
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,824
And what happens when the kids who grew up in this baboon culture

492
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Switch to other Troop

493
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:16,480
Not supposed to eat miss it if just one baboon from the nice if you went off to join the menes Heap

494
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
Probably get his ass kicked but he thinks

495
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
How did you get to nice

496
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Balloons together

497
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Make a little bit of a team

498
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Arabic language

499
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Critical mass of niceness

500
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
I just might

501
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Red

502
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
And turn all the other guys nice

503
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
In principle this

504
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
Like great unique

505
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
Pacific culture in these baboons

506
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Could be transmissible

507
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
Who in Siri

508
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,568
Okay well don't leave us hanging I got what

509
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Has happy

510
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,176
Okay so what actually happened is pretty

511
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Damn Grimm

512
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Did they did they go back to being mean

513
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,672
In substance is really worse than that number how this whole thing begins because there's a troop next to sapolsky

514
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
I may be eating garbage

515
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
In a garbage dump

516
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Eventually sapolsky

517
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
But now the garbage dump is open and available

518
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
They went over there and began looking at the tourist Lodge

519
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
And just living off of garbage now they just

520
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
With the garbage

521
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
And essentially

522
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
Stopped functioning as a coherent truth

523
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,784
So this question will they all become nice baboons eventually or will they all revert back to

524
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
To being mean baboon

525
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
That. Totally trumped by

526
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
The garbage

527
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
There was so much food.

528
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Need for these baboons

529
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,840
Hakeem so free and so available that the natural business of baboonery

530
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Just broke down

531
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,216
Lot of males around that being killed by game Park Rangers there because

532
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
As per usual with a sort of thing they got dangerous to the humans

533
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
There because

534
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
They got to habituate

535
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
The humans

536
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,432
So lots of males were killed

537
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
The rest of the troupe is

538
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,784
Defragment it so

539
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
I never

540
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
Got to find out what

541
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
What happened in the long run

542
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
Cuz the garbage got in the way again

543
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Yep

544
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Exactly that's simulator I've seen you at

545
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,816
What's the troubling thing here for me is that how you know there was

546
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
Traditional baboon culture which was

547
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Violin hierarchy

548
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
Call there was this

549
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Hint of a hope

550
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Have a different

551
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Baboon culture which was

552
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
Grooming and happiness

553
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640
And we had a question about which one of those two would spread or

554
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Last

555
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,504
But the truth is they ran into some junk food and then they have no culture

556
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,600
Exactly what I had to say it that sounds depressingly like America

557
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah

558
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Unders

559
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,768
Bunches of them still there I'm sure as we speak actually not as we speak but

560
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
10 hours from now to philby

561
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Waddling / 2

562
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,984
Get some leftovers they're probably not missing the culture that they had but

563
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Yeah those were my guys

564
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,408
I had my last season out there for years ago and haven't been back since

565
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
To quote a

566
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
We would do anything

567
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
For you any

568
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Where is daffodil

569
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
So you just so you know

570
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
View all I will

571
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Okay

572
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Oh God

573
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:26,176
Just managed to get that stupid song out of my head rehearsal earlier today thanks a lot

574
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Aware

575
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,704
My name is Julie Rogers and I'm calling from a nice walk on the streets of Oakland

576
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,104
Radiolab supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science

577
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Technology in the modern world

578
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,480
More information about Sloan at www.starone.org

579
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,112
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

580
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
And I'm here because I need your

581
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
And I request

582
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,632
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

583
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

584
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Brilliance

585
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Basically I want to hear about this

586
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,336
Times when a kid you know did something

587
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
It just means you lean back and say

588
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Well

589
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
How did they do that

590
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Maybe it was the moment that I

591
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
Kids started reading back

592
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Do you

593
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

594
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,976
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

595
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,840
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

596
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:53,728
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

597
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
It doesn't have anything to do with it

598
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
If you have a story

599
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
T-shirt

600
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
Go to radiolab.org

601
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Brilliance

602
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
And record a short Audiomack

603
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,040
And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

604
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Thank you so much

605
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
Hey I'm Jared Broadway rubber chromatids Radiolab topic today

606
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Choice and human destiny

607
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
With a way we are is that the way we're going to stay

608
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
A very nicely but here in the last section we were talking about a baboon and their propensity to Sirius

609
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Maybe or maybe not we don't

610
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,856
Really no

611
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
Blitz which R8 will go to Oregonian or just a rare subset of human being

612
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,816
Set up we were thinking a lot about

613
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Small groups

614
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
On the show

615
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Yeah cuz that's what we are we are small group primates

616
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
The phrase sometimes used to describe humans

617
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
And it's a phrase

618
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Carry some negative connotation

619
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,200
As involved in these small groups that we are predisposed to be small-minded no

620
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
Small is not always a bad thing

621
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
I tell you story now this

622
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
The small groups

623
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
Story it's just as a warning

624
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
Contains graphic

625
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
But

626
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,280
We hope you'll stick with it cuz it's a really cool story takes place in a small town

627
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:29,728
You can dial the wrong number and still have a conversation

628
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
So tell me where we are in end

629
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
Downtown Silverton

630
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Essentially our downtown is not changed since the

631
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
Late 40s early 50s

632
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
But we'll get to that this is Stu Rasmussen either main character

633
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
A little while back still gave myself and producer Aaron Scott

634
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,744
A tour movie theater on the corner of the old hardware store on this corner

635
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,048
This builder of his favorite place on Earth

636
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,864
Silverton Oregon Roots about 40 miles from Portland

637
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,216
Top 40 years for Portland actually you know it's the town I grew up in

638
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
My image for what I want silver going to be no I rode my bicycle down the street and came to the hardware store tea

639
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
How are you and wave all the time it's a small town everybody knows me

640
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Ifrit

641
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Stu

642
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
This time would never change

643
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
You would stay frozen in that quaint

644
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
Norman Rockwell candy-coated image

645
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm his boy had the weird thing though

646
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
Is it that image in his head

647
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Would probably never have included a guy likes

648
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
At least do as he is now

649
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,800
Is it is a show about change here is a story

650
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Funny pretty radical bit change

651
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
You wouldn't expect

652
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
Speaking of which can you describe where we are and what we're looking at

653
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
What were standing in front of the Palace Theater on the corner of Oakland Water Street Has Gone With the Wind theaters with a Big Mac

654
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
Marquis in the bulb lights

655
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,488
And everything built in 1935 and in continuous operation ever since

656
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
Staples out some keys and opened it up

657
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,960
He suggested that we do the interview here in the town's only theater even smells like a Gilded Age

658
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,544
Theater at 1 p.m. still smelled like popcorn from the previous night

659
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
And was filled with nothing

660
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
200 Mt read

661
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,944
Velvet seats in a small town theater

662
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Beautiful

663
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Lights off

664
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
Okay see you later okay thank you

665
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Best seats in the house right in the middle

666
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
Pretend We're watching a movie of your life

667
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Hilarious adult movie

668
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Hardly

669
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
So the movie of Stew begins

670
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
In 1975

671
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
27

672
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,520
He said theater just like that seminal moment in my life

673
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
Who's won The Rocky Horror Picture Show came out stew is in the projects

674
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
That's a Java changing the rails and at some point

675
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
During one of the musical numbers

676
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
Glances at the screen and

677
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
It was like

678
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,464
What was what was the oh here was this movie

679
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
With a guy

680
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
In Drag

681
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
On screen

682
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Sweet Transvestite

683
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,496
Transexual Transylvania

684
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,824
What's a word that I've never heard

685
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
I watch that again and again

686
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,320
Fast forward 10 years to now owns the theater just like his dad before him

687
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
He's an upstanding member of the town

688
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,184
Silverton city council then on the library board

689
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
Then

690
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
He starts to

691
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Transform everyone will tell you

692
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
It began with an a

693
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,168
I think I probably started having my nails done in 94-95

694
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,008
And started out with very masculine nails without polishing

695
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
Square and then

696
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,408
Slowly grew them out that I went into what I considered a masculine nail color of blue

697
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Gradually

698
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Start to paint them red

699
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
Acrylic tips

700
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
Got longer and longer this was the first test

701
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
The community

702
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
How are you

703
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
Cuz I would be at the theater taking tickets

704
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,304
Be dressed as usual and plaid shirt jeans and boots and would come out

705
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
For their ticket

706
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,912
What in the hell are those

707
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,056
You can't miss any know you had a lost fingernail long-time Silvertown in

708
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:23,456
I had to give him my ticket to sell though she 17 and he ripped it and like his nails like

709
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,088
Went down the palm of my hand and just gave me the chills nails were the first thing

710
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
El Palmar veterinarian

711
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
And city council

712
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Born and raised turn silver

713
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
Hoquiam definitely talk

714
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,888
But it happened so gradually to something you hear again and again it happened

715
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Graduate

716
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
First it was

717
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
The nails and

718
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
And then

719
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
At some point in time he changed the focus of the movie theater and was really making a game attempt to get new release

720
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Lisa's

721
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
Frequently you know when there was a theme kind of movie

722
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
He would get in the costume my name is Ken Ham

723
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
Former mayor of that sort

724
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,464
And very often the costume would be female attire Step 2

725
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,048
Upstairs very careful transition coordinator when we spoke with four years

726
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
After the nails he would

727
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Quote promote that week's movie

728
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
By dressing up for one of the new Star Wars movies was out and it wasn't a coincidence you've dressed as Queen

729
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
Family Dollar

730
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
I love you

731
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,760
There was a movie called that My Big Fat Greek Wedding

732
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,160
Also a lifelong silvertone Ian

733
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
The complete with the veil. Of course got everybody

734
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
Will put it together with

735
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
Is it on the web

736
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,728
She's a registered nurse sexuality

737
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
Transgender or any of those things I think we thought it was just dressing up to go along with his with his movies

738
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
There was

739
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,992
Clearly a let's go by the movie theater tonight cuz we've got to know what

740
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
Stu's wearing you pursue this was just the beginning of something he was

741
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
He wasn't just Clowning Around when did your

742
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Ginger complexities begin

743
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
Probably 14 or 15

744
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
I think I was a shy young man

745
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
And interfacing with girls my mother was a bit

746
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
Strange on on that in the

747
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
Girls were evil and they would

748
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
No girl was good enough for her son and

749
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Data data.

750
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
That's how we did it all

751
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Not until I was out of high school

752
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Two girls were kind of scary it sounds all girls are scary

753
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Yeah

754
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
Well everybody else went on dates

755
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
He says he would

756
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Build computers

757
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Scratch

758
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
And even today

759
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
Is basement you'll find an entire electrical shop my God fun stuff

760
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,304
RF generator Spectrum analyzer logic analyzer

761
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
Who said the best that he can

762
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Explain himself

763
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Genuine

764
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,776
Just say that when he looks in the mirror he likes himself better

765
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Distressed

766
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
To the woman I don't know how to describe it

767
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,528
I can understand it I mean some people like to dress up and look like a cowboy or

768
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
Lumberjack whatever

769
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
What's your mental image of yourself that you look in the mirror and you like

770
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,488
Set after Nails after a

771
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:20,352
Dozens of episodes of social example cross-dressing took the next step

772
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,192
Begin to perform some experiments like he would go to The LumberYard

773
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:30,592
Just to get some stuff to nails or something all the while he would be wearing a padded bra under his flannel shirt

774
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,688
Just to see what would happen to this tree was like a test it was like a calculated test

775
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
To absolute age if it was possible

776
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
If I could survive

777
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
With breast

778
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
So when he was 52 he drove into Portland visited

779
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
The doctor put him to sleep

780
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,864
The doctors made two small incisions one under each breast about an inch and a half or 2in

781
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,752
Long and they pulled back the skin on each side slit in an uninflated balloon and then pump it up with water until

782
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
The skin was stretched to the point that

783
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
Was almost transparent

784
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
That sounds very painful

785
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Was it

786
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Well

787
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
I was asleep at the time

788
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
But when he woke up

789
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
He was a different man

790
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,064
Because he now had several pounds of new stuff

791
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Hanging off his chest

792
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Who is singing at that moment

793
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
I was thinking

794
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
What have I

795
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Done

796
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,048
There's no going back I can remember being in

797
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,120
Mac's Place downtown at a table and

798
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
He was coming across the street with his breath

799
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,568
Prominently showing and it was the first time any of us realized that he had actually had surgery

800
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
And when lady was going

801
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,504
Look like any other lady was going to look across the street and oh my God

802
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
Look it's to my God what is he doing

803
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:49,696
There was a buzz around the situation when he walked by and then return

804
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Ensue

805
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Yes

806
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,816
Basically this is Victorious age

807
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Stew's longtime girlfriend

808
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Living together for 36 years

809
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,008
Be walking in our local Goodwill in would be a few miles away from each other and

810
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
I would hear

811
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
Like he had changed

812
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Somehow

813
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,456
It's just trying to

814
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,808
Fulfill that body image he's got in his head

815
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
West York

816
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Body image

817
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Mate

818
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
As I've been difficult

819
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
No

820
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,216
No I'm sorry it if you if you want to get kinky about it

821
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
A man with

822
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Chronicle

823
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Okay

824
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Did the

825
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Was there ever any

826
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Concern

827
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
There was for me not so much force to I think

828
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,112
Partly because he didn't hear as many Whispers as I felt I did

829
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
But

830
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
I was concerned for the theater business

831
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Not without reason

832
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
A lot of kids in the town stop coming to the theater cuz their parents wouldn't let him take his health to go ahead and

833
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
Wasn't long before pickup trucks full of teenage boys with drive-by the theater yelling slurs

834
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Well yeah I guess

835
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
I guess

836
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Fagedes

837
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
Fleur I guess so you get to this point in the

838
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,552
Sped up movie narrative UPS to this point right here we're even

839
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,856
Though he took it so slowly

840
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
So careful

841
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
It's still

842
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
Easy to imagine things turning ugly I don't know what was that movie about the boy that was Beno draw

843
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
Dragon Beat to Death because he was gay in a small town in the midwest you know what a voice.

844
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
According to Linda Webb silverton's not so different from Laramie Wyoming where Matthew Shepard lived it's a small town

845
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
Very traditional very conservative

846
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
To expect the worst but here's the surprise

847
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
And the whole reason we came here so rude

848
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Monday January

849
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,328
The worst did not happen

850
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,960
It was no redneck rebellion in fact the opposite happened

851
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Something historic

852
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
I

853
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,896
High on January 5th 2009 the town of Silverton elected stew

854
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
Mayor of the city of Silverton Marion County Oregon congratulations

855
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
Silverton has a length of a nation's first openly transgender mayor directions first openly

856
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
Transgender man

857
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:43,008
Transgender in heels

858
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
Speaking of the sound of

859
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
Stew's 4 inch heels pounding on linoleum

860
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,016
Is he goes to city council meeting

861
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
O'Hara

862
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
Couldn't be better how are you

863
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
Nicole Wallace

864
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
You know

865
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,536
City elitist or whatever but I met her in a plunging v-neck sweater and a black mini skirt

866
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Not what you would expect

867
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
A tiny Conservative Republican town

868
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
So we want to know

869
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Your why did this happen

870
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,264
Co-producer Aaron Scott and I walked around town for a couple days

871
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
And we interviewed dozens of people including

872
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
Guy named Ken Hector

873
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Beat out from there

874
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,016
He's a Conservative Republican definitely not one of those big fans

875
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,088
It was just a difference in philosophy about

876
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
I don't want to sound pretentious but you know as a mayor I think they're certain extra

877
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Haitians

878
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,744
About professionalism of that

879
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
You should exhibit

880
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
He would come in

881
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Where at

882
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Appetite

883
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Cleaning copper

884
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Cleavage down to here

885
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
You're almost point of your belly button

886
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:49,056
Come on you know when you're at the council meeting show some dignity here and just

887
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
Dress

888
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,895
In the appropriate attire for the occasion

889
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,735
Can even try to get the city council to impose a dress code

890
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
But when we asked him you know are you surprised

891
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
The town has

892
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Embraced

893
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
And even got so far to elect a mayor

894
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
He said

895
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,327
No news of Rarity in that you know there's a lot of people in this town

896
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Extremely religious

897
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Very conservative people

898
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Word a stranger

899
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,335
Who came into town suddenly I'm sure the support and perception might have been different but you're talking about a Native Son

900
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Who grew up

901
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
He said

902
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:31,551
Who runs the only theater in town so he's out there every weekend standing out from the Palace Theater

903
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,111
Taking tickets to everybody knows

904
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
Back in the day we used to be the Cable Guy

905
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
Play home is still the guy you call here

906
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,583
Your computer so it might sound strange to you but it's

907
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
And that is when it hit me

908
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Actually

909
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Under the right circumstances

910
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Small town could be like the most

911
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,079
Progressive place on Earth

912
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,991
And it's exactly because everyone's all up in your grill

913
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
You are forced to know people

914
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,599
Like stew

915
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Oh my goodness

916
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
I grew up with stew

917
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,279
Amy I remember when stool is like an altar boy at the church as my brother

918
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
This is Susie team

919
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
Retired teacher his parents and my parents

920
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,263
Like a lot of folks and silver 10 she is known stew for so long and so many different contexts

921
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,407
But you can't do that New York thing with him where you like you see someone on the sidewalk and you size them up instantly and thinking

922
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
Now after he's way too complicated

923
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:37,855
Note to her he's do the Altar Boys do the computer geek

924
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
City councilman sue the mayor or just

925
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
Do whatever

926
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
Go on about your business at the people we talked to

927
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
Effects of the same folks who said

928
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Yes just do

929
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
You are still not happy about the

930
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
The situation no I mean

931
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
I don't think God's a crossdresser

932
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
The other felt it was morally wrong

933
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
As in the case of this Menace

934
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Genesis 1

935
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
27 says so God created man in his own image

936
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,671
In the a.m. or some folks like Linda Webb husband John

937
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,255
Just felt like he takes it way too far right there it's in your face

938
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
He dresses kind of like a streetwalker

939
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,631
You feel that that's confrontational baidu

940
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,239
The most of the people who had objections it was a little more nuanced

941
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
It went something like this

942
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,871
Well I buy personally did not vote for him for mayor because I didn't feel it was

943
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Good idea to

944
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
Have someone

945
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
That look

946
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,759
Like that representing us but on the other hand

947
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,087
He is a good man and he's got this town at heart

948
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,903
Another rights according to John but really isn't stew

949
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Where the town

950
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
It's the outside

951
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,023
All those people out there who are going to hear about

952
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
And then judged

953
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
Which is what makes November 25th 2008

954
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
Such an interesting day

955
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Stupid just been elected mayor

956
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
Squeaked It Out by about 400 votes

957
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
But he hadn't yet been sworn in

958
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,783
When a group of Christian extremist from Kansas showed up and down and started marching up and down Main Street

959
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Yelling at the

960
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,647
And at one point that you can unfrozen American flag put it on the ground

961
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
And stepped on it

962
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:23,583
Just to show how expensive it sounds good

963
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Cuz they

964
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,311
Will not by any means warn him about to send this taking him to hell

965
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
So unpleasant and then bringing up signs that say things like God hates over tank God hate

966
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
It's your man. Hates f*** your pastor is a hore

967
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:52,511
The opposite sex from the town decided to start a counter protest

968
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Stood

969
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,351
Across the street from these people by and large

970
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Just a few guys

971
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
No earlier someone it suggests all the guys out to dress up as girls and all the girls I did dress up these guys and gassy Davidson

972
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
Said his initial reaction was

973
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Yeah right

974
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Very was

975
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:14,271
Address

976
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:18,623
He said that at first he in the two or three other guys who had on women's clothing

977
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
Felt a little weird

978
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
But then

979
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
People just started coming and was just amazed

980
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
Amazing of a couple of hundred people I mean men dress like women who dress like men some of the people that I sat down there

981
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
What's surprising

982
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,223
Because I had labeled them in my head as conservative people drive by

983
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
People signs got love sort of God loves to with costumes the town

984
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:57,023
Really lie about your gut getting bigger and bigger thinking that moment

985
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Understand you were standing off to the side just watching

986
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
What's going through your mind

987
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,703
Yeah well honestly I tried to discourage people from even giving them the time of day saying

988
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Don't give him any attention

989
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
I couldn't

990
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
Get that.

991
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
They were so angry

992
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
They they came out

993
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
200 people

994
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
Minute dresses

995
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
Grandmother's babies

996
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
It's just amazing

997
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
That was the town that wasn't me

998
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Sorry I guess

999
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Emotional

1000
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
That must have been a turning point for you

1001
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
The biggest one

1002
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,791
Frost Aaron Scott who did a huge chunk of the reporting for that piece and co-produced it with me

1003
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
We'll be right back

1004
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
Okay so that story with we did that about

1005
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
6

1006
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
7 years ago

1007
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
The world is different

1008
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Like what

1009
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Regards to transgender

1010
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
The language we use

1011
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,247
Change it back then we said transgendered

1012
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
And now we would

1013
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Transgender

1014
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
But with Caitlyn Jenner in the news and all the stuff we

1015
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Stadt

1016
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
Wondered like

1017
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,255
How have things changed for stew in these left

1018
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
6-7 years

1019
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,655
So hello

1020
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,727
We decided to send producer reporter Erin Scott

1021
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Back to Silver

1022
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,591
Sit down with Stu EyeMasters partner Victoria

1023
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Just to catch up

1024
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
I mean it's been 7 years

1025
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,503
Since I will be going on seven years six years

1026
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,063
Since we were in the store the first time

1027
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
Going on in your world

1028
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
Well since the election that's

1029
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:06,303
So the first thing you told me was that he got re-elected after 2 years and then he was re-elected again

1030
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
And then

1031
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Actress

1032
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
6 years of marriage

1033
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,471
You know out of the game hello you

1034
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
I have truly enjoying my vacation

1035
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:19,615
I need to tell me the back when the story first aired things did get

1036
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Kinda nutty

1037
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
Well you know it's probably the most unusual phone call we've ever received Victoria net worth

1038
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
Sitting at home the phone rang and it was a fellow

1039
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,183
From New York City who said I was bicycling in on Manhattan

1040
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Listening to the original Radio Lab piece

1041
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
And

1042
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,887
He thought it would be really fun to do my life story as a musical

1043
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,727
But I know it's a big deal

1044
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
Any dip

1045
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,359
That fella was Andrew Russell he put on a big production up in Seattle it got standing ovation

1046
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
The most

1047
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
Surreal and bizarre

1048
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:58,783
Experience in my life sitting in an auditorium with 400 strangers watching as

1049
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
In song and dance

1050
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
My life goes by

1051
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
You can call me

1052
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
And she can call me

1053
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
Can call me

1054
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
You can call me

1055
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
You can call me

1056
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,911
Can call me she went

1057
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,543
So there is this musical which seemed to do pretty well and then

1058
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
A movie producer called them up and said that

1059
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
You wanted to options to his wife for a movie

1060
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,991
And now Victoria says those Whispers that they used to get

1061
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
Those have turned into people wanting

1062
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Autograph

1063
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,879
We're stopping them in the shoe store and saying you stew

1064
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,951
Are true that beer can I get a picture with you

1065
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
What's sure

1066
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Really

1067
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
What's the big deal

1068
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,935
But one of the most interesting things for me was that a lot of that attention was at the beginning

1069
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
These states two sides

1070
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,263
You know he's transgender issues him

1071
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
Grown in in the national news

1072
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,871
The ad on TV shows

1073
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Deuces the

1074
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,943
Back in Silverton

1075
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,735
Cities transgender

1076
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,783
Becoming pretty much passe

1077
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
So

1078
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
Here we are

1079
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,951
You says it's just kind of routine now

1080
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
For him and everyone else

1081
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,071
Except he did say there's this one thing

1082
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:19,167
Every time the story are their rears which it does from time to time

1083
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
When it when it goes

1084
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
The phone starts ringing a week

1085
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:27,359
Tell where it's from he says he gets these calls from people who are struggling with their own gender issues

1086
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,919
We're trying to figure out how to come out to their family

1087
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:36,575
And people actually call your home phone usually anonymously they won't identify themselves necessarily because they're still

1088
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,647
He'll either closeted or not really ready to come out there saying

1089
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
Thank you so much for being yourself

1090
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
And for telling your story to other so that I can

1091
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
You know I can validate my life from that thank you

1092
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,679
Does that ever get old

1093
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
No

1094
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:58,591
For somebody who was in the position that I wasn't made the change and then to have other people

1095
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,639
Either following along or

1096
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,711
Emulating in one way or another

1097
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,831
Is very gratifying because it validates my life and it says why you weren't a complete waste of time

1098
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,415
A lot more than a lot of people get

1099
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,439
Special thanks to producer Eddie McEwen for helping us and all the update

1100
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Hey this is Tracy

1101
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Changsha Hunan China

1102
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,631
The lab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

1103
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology

1104
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Party in the modern world

1105
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
More information about slowing

1106
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,591
Www. Sloan

1107
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
Are we about to do thoughts

1108
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,039
Okay

1109
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:15,647
Hey I'm driving right by Robert krulwich Radiolab and today we're talking about

1110
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
Change really what what looks like

1111
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
So you remember back to the booze when we started this

1112
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Program

1113
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,607
The question were asking then was Will those baboons

1114
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,447
If they do enough Generations will they create a new color lipstick looks.

1115
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
What's up let's hope we don't know whole milk and the town that uses a mayor is that town expanding the sense of

1116
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
Possibility or stop lower blood pressure

1117
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:41,759
Now let's get really serious there are indeed

1118
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
Changes that deuce

1119
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Stick

1120
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,903
We're going to examine a rather startling example of it right now

1121
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:53,279
But you do that we need an evolutionary biologist and we found one at Duke University

1122
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,119
Yeah hello who's this that's Brian hair

1123
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,519
And the first thing Brian your did was tell me about another guy

1124
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,359
I have was a very famous geneticist in Russia

1125
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,943
He was alive during World War II and doing genetic

1126
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
Lights work but after World War II

1127
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
He was a little spot of trouble

1128
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,183
But what you do well because he was a real darwinian he believed in evolution and genetics

1129
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,535
But thinking about Evolution like a darwinian evolution is does

1130
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,703
That was not popular in Stalin's Russia is popular the word or was that a death sentence it was a distance

1131
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
So

1132
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,031
The writing was on the wall

1133
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,615
Any new that he should probably take the Trans-Siberian railroad

1134
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,919
From Moscow quickly

1135
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Quickly

1136
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
And he went to

1137
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Nova De Beers

1138
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,367
And the way that Dimitri blab decided to hide his continued in

1139
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Starting darwinian Evolution was

1140
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
He would begin a fox

1141
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,999
Farm where he would make

1142
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Fur coats

1143
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,327
So what is Mr Bean live actually doing what

1144
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
Dr. balaya was actually interest

1145
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,167
Was to understand

1146
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,471
How does domestication happen

1147
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:14,175
That's a question that's a dumb question or select them question in all because you just going to bring that note I think about a wild ant

1148
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
It is impulsive

1149
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,295
It is aggressive it growl

1150
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,135
What is it a wolf or you're playing a wolf that I've got there

1151
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
This is

1152
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
A domesticated

1153
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,679
The nature the animal has completely changed here and if you want to learn something about the nature of a creature how it can change

1154
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,495
Domesticate animals are wonderful place to start

1155
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
Supplier

1156
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
He decided why did I just

1157
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
Experimental domesticate semana

1158
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,735
And his cover was that he was going to make better for a cup

1159
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,295
When was the 1959

1160
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,903
Kiss a Sputnik was up Russians were feeling good and he was making fur coats so to speak

1161
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
So to speak began one of the most

1162
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
Exciting experiments in biology

1163
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:04,095
Things with Demetri but life does he goes to a bunch of fox Pharmacy to look at I want to buy

1164
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
A bunch

1165
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:09,727
Foxes and he says we'll all I got to do is take this group of foxes and break him in the shoe

1166
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
And one group

1167
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
I'm not going to change them in any way

1168
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
Okay so it's like a controller

1169
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,639
So when we was just normal Fox normal

1170
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
But the other line

1171
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,759
I'm going to decide who is going to be allowed to breed

1172
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
And who is

1173
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Unfortunately

1174
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
It going to be a haircut

1175
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
Some of the factors get to have

1176
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Puppy foxes

1177
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,487
Of their own and some foxes become

1178
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,559
So what are you doing

1179
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Marvelously

1180
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
You go or what

1181
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,167
Roach in

1182
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Where the fox

1183
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Beautiful baby

1184
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
Author of a juvenile

1185
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,799
The experimenter would stay

1186
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
Stand say a foot away

1187
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
And we just try to touch

1188
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
The fox

1189
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Hi

1190
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
Run Fox Run

1191
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,991
If the fox would make

1192
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
This kind of sound

1193
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
And sort of cower in the corner like

1194
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
Most boxing

1195
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
Would do

1196
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:04,255
What is that what the sound is the sound a Fox Makes

1197
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
So what happens if I make that sound

1198
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,191
They did not breathe at Fox in the Next Generation board put it another way

1199
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Pretty much

1200
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
That's just wrong but now

1201
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,919
Every so often like maybe one out of every 20 foxes there would be a fox

1202
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
It would not

1203
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Would not

1204
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
It wasn't afraid then

1205
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
Then they would

1206
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Shoes that fart

1207
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
2

1208
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
Read in the Next Generation

1209
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,951
Let me get this over and over again

1210
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:40,351
Generation after generation they would breed the nice boxes together get rid of a bad foxes breed the neck

1211
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:46,751
Except get rid of a bad foxes read the next set next set next set neck

1212
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
Next

1213
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:55,455
What happened in the end eventually if they had foxes that were attracted to humans no job how long do you think

1214
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
It would take to get boxes

1215
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
For being wild ferocious animals

1216
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:05,439
Tubing animals to would lick your face after this kind of like a how many year Exterminating

1217
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,999
Reading Eggs

1218
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,559
A long long time I mean I would garlic

1219
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
Like how many years how many years how many

1220
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,191
Well it took wolves like thousands of years income dogs

1221
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,263
Diamond almond long time well here's this here's the thing

1222
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,055
10 years ago

1223
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:29,503
Don't tell me to shut up

1224
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,783
Crazy what was

1225
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,575
Exciting and surprising

1226
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
Was that

1227
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:41,023
The same foxes they actually show a whole Suite of changes that he did not select for on Purp

1228
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,327
I like what do you mean physical change

1229
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,399
These foxes as they became more gentle

1230
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,703
For some unaccountable reason

1231
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
Their ears

1232
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
Instead of pointing straight up

1233
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,663
Flip over that's right it was a big accident that they now have floppy ears the tail

1234
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,783
Now they have curly tails

1235
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,671
They have multi colored coats that are no longer just grape tips of their paws

1236
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,719
Color the teeth

1237
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
Get smaller and their bones became very thin their bones got the yes

1238
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:23,519
What happens to the skull and the face is it actually becomes more feminine

1239
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
Dead Sea

1240
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
I don't know what to make of that

1241
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:36,831
And it's not over this experiment has been going on at 7:50 years 45000 foxes

1242
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
Later who is read about this is that I got to see this for myself so he went to a

1243
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
Xenoverse 2 beerus

1244
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,375
Just to check it out I did I took the Trans-Siberian railroad which you know

1245
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,423
2 days of looking at green grass

1246
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
And there's like one species of tree

1247
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,031
And I think there was a butterfly that was kind of pretty

1248
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:02,431
I was at birch trees you look at Bridge Street and mother Bridge Street and Liberty Street and pretty much

1249
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
You got it you got it

1250
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,247
So I show up and they had

1251
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Thousands

1252
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
A foxes

1253
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,111
Giant buildings that are probably you know as long as a football for

1254
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Full of

1255
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Just rows and rows

1256
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Of fox

1257
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,583
And when you see them they actually wag their tail they whine like a puppy dog

1258
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,679
They're cute and cuddly and they love people and they don't bite

1259
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Sounds perfect

1260
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Except

1261
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
For the one thing I forgot to tell you

1262
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
Is that when they're yapping

1263
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Beside the sea

1264
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:35,967
They cannot help but pee for joy

1265
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
Makes sense to me that they're getting nicer

1266
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295
Is there breeding them to get nice

1267
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,623
Why is all this other stuff happening with their to their body

1268
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
What's going on

1269
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Well you know

1270
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,743
The unsatisfactory answer that problem

1271
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
Nobody really

1272
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Knows why

1273
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,679
Why am I in this is to synchronize

1274
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
Sync

1275
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,775
Evolutionary biologist at the University of st. Andrews in sky

1276
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
And he has

1277
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Inotia

1278
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
This is just a hypothesis

1279
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
Here's what he told me

1280
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,759
Did you guys go back to when a fox has a very very little

1281
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:14,111
Inside its mother's womb very very very early embryo

1282
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Like two months

1283
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
How to become a fox

1284
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,719
Who can survive in the world this d'olimpio need

1285
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Strong

1286
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,559
Pastor gropher you defer

1287
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:28,959
Bone strong I don't need to go all these things that you

1288
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Need as an adult

1289
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
All of them come from the same fountain

1290
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,823
The population of cells in an embryo

1291
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
Wow I didn't know that

1292
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Called mural

1293
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,479
When the fox grows in the south

1294
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,039
Sir goony's epic migrations these guys are like

1295
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
Pioneers

1296
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
Moving throughout the body and blazing Trails some of them go out into the skin some of them

1297
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,559
Happened to the cartilage of the Fox's beard

1298
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,959
All these different issues tell big parts of the nervous system

1299
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,543
Major parts of the brain and the adrenal glands

1300
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,615
What's a real man that's the most important one for our

1301
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
The adrenal gland

1302
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
I'm sad

1303
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
When

1304
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,479
To be afraid

1305
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,575
If you against a well that's something that makes

1306
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:22,463
Whatever that sounds like it's the one that makes that sound when your breeding

1307
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Hear out of an animal

1308
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,327
Maybe what you doing

1309
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,375
Is your slowing down

1310
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:34,239
The migrations of these cells

1311
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
They don't deliver the fear

1312
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
If you don't deliver all the other things that they use

1313
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,919
What you're focusing on what you as the experimenter doing

1314
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,967
I want the guys who's adrenal glands

1315
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,599
That might have the function of making the animal more team but what you're doing is a by-product

1316
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:54,719
The bat is selecting for guys who don't get as many of those cells into their ears and don't get as many of

1317
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,655
So if you get some of the cells you need

1318
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
How to make your ears

1319
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Pyramids

1320
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,239
Straight but not quite enough

1321
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,055
And your ear will go up to a certain point

1322
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:12,383
I think the sales are going to complete the deal the rest of your ear

1323
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,663
Flops over

1324
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
Really you haven't come is that why dogs have little sloppy joe

1325
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,855
Slow down to the point where they don't

1326
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:28,255
Finish the job they were still there are literally arrested the argument is that

1327
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
When you select against aggression in animals

1328
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,887
You're changing the time in the rate of development such that

1329
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,935
The experimental foxes are actually

1330
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,471
Frozen as juveniles

1331
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,591
They actually never really grow up

1332
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,967
So then to domesticate a fox

1333
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,343
Just like to domesticate a wolf and you can talk what you doing

1334
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Is you making permanent puppies

1335
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,463
Peter Pan kind of things

1336
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,559
So if we wanted to apply the store to us

1337
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
And we wanted to say breed a gentler

1338
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
Bleeker human being

1339
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
We should just

1340
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,615
Kill the football players is that the idea

1341
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:21,247
Like with the foxes you just eliminate the meeting with the same thing happened to us

1342
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
Really

1343
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,599
Remember to eat professionally interview.

1344
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,415
I was back a Richard wrangham vividly

1345
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,279
Movie think about humans obviously we're getting are just super specs

1346
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
But he says if you choose to

1347
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
Go back if we go back

1348
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
Just 30000 50000 years

1349
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
And you look at the collection of

1350
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Goals

1351
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
The early versions of Ostrom way back

1352
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
I think you see some interest

1353
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,639
Like changes

1354
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,455
If you look at a domesticated animal

1355
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
They have smaller teeth

1356
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
That want to dance

1357
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
And in humans we've been getting smaller teeth

1358
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Over

1359
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
The last few tens of thousands of years

1360
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,047
Like the Box we've been getting more gracile bones that means to say that

1361
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,399
Particular length of limbo and it becomes a little bit narrower

1362
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
Just like the

1363
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
So it is tempting to think

1364
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
That

1365
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,055
The same kind of process

1366
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,871
What's been going on in humans as a pink eye going into my

1367
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,407
Animals which is that

1368
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
There's meaning

1369
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Selection

1370
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
In favor of

1371
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,015
Kinder gentler human

1372
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:30,623
Wait a second. Who's doing the selecting in the case of the foxes

1373
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
Mitsubishi LF shot you if you were

1374
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
Too aggressive

1375
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:41,119
Who's selecting the who's domesticating the humans

1376
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
Is that it was the

1377
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
A growing tendency for

1378
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
Hunter-gatherer ancestors

1379
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Settle down

1380
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
In the

1381
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Instable

1382
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,407
You mean like summer camps

1383
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
Sing songs about communities but if you are in a very small family group

1384
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:06,463
Well then it pays to be big and strong and mean because of you are the biggest guy and you meet a smaller guy and he's got some potato you

1385
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:12,095
Grab him eat his potatoes beat him up and then move on to the next till you never have to see him again

1386
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
But let's say

1387
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,495
It is time passes Human Society grows on

1388
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,055
We might have 30 or 40 people

1389
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,199
That way you can build bigger fires and you can catch more bunnies and you can defend against enemies

1390
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,271
But in this world if you beat everybody up

1391
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,623
You may not survive that when pitted against anybody else

1392
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,647
One on one

1393
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,999
The big strong pink eye is a win-win big strong mean doesn't

1394
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
And we see this in summer

1395
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
When you can start to form coalition

1396
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,119
When you can start that multiple in

1397
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,703
She say a mean guy stop it

1398
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
What you can't take on

1399
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,383
Both of us or all three of us or our whole group

1400
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,455
Go away we're going to deal with this guy

1401
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:05,855
Maybe they deal with him by shouting and Darna ostracizing him or even capital punishment

1402
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:10,207
Richard wrangham theory is

1403
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:16,607
Who they can't have kids to spread their genes because they have the unfortunate condition of being dead then we've essentially bread

1404
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,911
The more aggressive genes or

1405
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
We have

1406
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Domestic

1407
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,127
What we're really talking about groups versus individuals

1408
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,431
And $0.07 I think we're really talking

1409
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
Beginning of society

1410
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,271
Rule of law

1411
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
In the way that we think of

1412
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,887
And this pressure

1413
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
Be a little more gentle

1414
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
Going to be a little bit more quiet

1415
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,263
It hasn't gone away

1416
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
If anything we're being select

1417
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
To work together more

1418
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
Took took

1419
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,687
Be able to tolerate being packed in even tighter

1420
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
What you put 20 chips on a Jet Plane

1421
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,039
And try to send them across the Atlantic

1422
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,831
Let me tell you that only one or two

1423
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,927
We do this all the time we take it for granted

1424
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
Is human beings.

1425
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:21,119
Big groups of people can get along with one another I do think that is reasonable

1426
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,679
Imagine that humans have a future of

1427
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
Increasing

1428
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:28,287
Self domestication what I sent you proposing

1429
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:34,943
Is it as the Earth gets more crowded all the creatures on Earth are these dissension could you have to start learning to live with each other to the Marcos

1430
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,479
Bumping into each other

1431
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:43,135
The winners will be the domesticated wild everyone will get more empathetic to each other because that's the only way you survive

1432
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
Let me get gentler

1433
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,511
And gently and gentler tool am literally lie down

1434
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
With lion

1435
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
You said it Beauty

1436
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,983
But I do believe it

1437
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,823
Well we may have to go through water through ups and downs before we get there

1438
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,359
And of course to something

1439
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:10,015
Select the alarming about the fact that one possible mechanism by which domestication is Happy than humans

1440
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
This through

1441
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,807
Literally EX

1442
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
Execution of

1443
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,879
The more aggressive types

1444
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
But in the long-term

1445
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
Sure

1446
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Let's hope that

1447
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
