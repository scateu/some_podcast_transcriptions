21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,448
We caught up with her and Hyderabad where she's currently training

22
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
And

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
I called her because a few years ago

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
Right as her career was taking off

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
She got caught up in this

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
Maelstrom

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
That almost ended it

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,856
And throughout the series we've been asking all these questions about biological sex inside the body

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,488
And this moment in her life takes all of the questions and thrust

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Sim out into the world

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
It is very public

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Way

33
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Just a start

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
At the beginning

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Optima battery

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
Miss Colima

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,456
I'm from the village in Orissa called check agaval blur

38
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
There 9 people in my family

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
6 sisters 1 brother and my parents

40
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
Is the one who got me into running when I was 5 years old

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Duty sister was a track star in school

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
How older she started training me

43
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
There was no track to run on so I would run along the edge of the river or

44
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
On the road

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Or in the village

46
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
What time is it

47
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,272
Our family was poor and we couldn't afford shoes

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
So I would run barefoot

49
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
And the tiny pebbles in the road would get stuck in my feet

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
My sister pushed me

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
She didn't let me slack off when I would complain or not want to train

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Years Minaj kept training with her

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:53,568
Sister and she just got faster and faster and faster until 2012 she had his big break

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm trying to think of how old she was then I think she was 16 this is a journalist who has spoken

55
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648

100 m in 11.8 seconds

58
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
Indian female Runners are running that same race in 12.2 or 12

59
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
Grown-up professional runners while she's still a teenager and then the next year

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
She goes back to the youth National Championship with gold

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
She ran her best hundred time yet

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
11.62 only about a second slower than the world record

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,344
Any June 2014

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
She wins gold again at the Asian championship in Taipei

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,815
My coach and my family started saying to me

69
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Do the you're going to go to the Olympics

70
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
So duty is

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Basically the hottest young female runner in India

72
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
And then

73
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
2014

74
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
Was preparing for the Commonwealth Games

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
Which are sort of like a warm-up to the Olympics

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
It's for certain countries and as she's

77
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Preparing for the games

78
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
She gets sent to the team doctors for doping test

79
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,047
And she said like this was kind of a normal part of her life

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
Blood test

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,983
I had blood test done ever since I was little

82
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
We did take a dope test

83
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
A month before every tournament

84
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Also after the race

85
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
So she goes to see the team doctor

86
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
And he's like

87
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
No blood we're going to do an ultrasound

88
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Which is not normal

89
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
And so she asked them

90
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Why

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,743
And they just said oh we're like looking at your bone density and so she's like okay whatever

92
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Eventually she does do a normal blood test

93
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Goes back

94
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Keep straining to the games

95
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
Couple of weeks later picks up the newspaper and sees her picture on the front page of the newspaper

96
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
There's a picture of me with a huge headline screaming

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
DT disqualified from the team

98
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
It said that

99
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
I was a male not a female

100
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
She has no idea what's going on but you said at that point her phone starts

101
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Blowing up

102
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
The media called me and told me all the details like there was this gender test that have

103
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Saying is it true is it true you failed a gender test

104
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,175
No I burned them just yet. There was this hyperandrogenism test

105
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Is gender test and the results said that I wasn't a woman that I was a man

106
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
Compete with the women

107
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,511
Didn't understand how this could happen

108
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
And the media kept asking me what are you actually

109
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
And I said

110
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
I don't know my parents gave birth to me and I grew up the way that they raced me the Mello Kings I'm a girl

111
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,639
Woman and I didn't know about anything that was being reported about me

112
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
You feel the gender test

113
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
Yeah what was happening the MRIs in this ultrasounds

114
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
What exactly is a gender test

115
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Like what is that

116
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Exactly

117
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
I I didn't add that.

118
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
Duty thing it was the first time I'd ever heard that phrase but it's

119
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
Actually the thing that's been happening in sports for a long time

120
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
And I'm going to take you on a journey back to the beginning of it

121
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
So I didn't know this but the but the sort of first modern

122
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Olympics of 1896

123
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
Simsbury Center

124
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
There are no female ass

125
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
And apparently like the one of the people who is

126
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
Charger assertive like restarting the Olympic set something like this

127
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Like no place for women

128
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
But

129
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,055
Sure nuff by 1900 decided to allow women

130
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Meet the Press time

131
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
You had

132
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
22 female athletes

133
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,271
Which pills works best for athletic competition could physically damage the week of

134
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Was not uncontroversial

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
But

136
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
By the 19 by 1960 summer games of the 17th Olympia

137
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
Which were the Olympics in Rome there are 600 female athlete

138
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,263
And so two things complete at the same time which is a lot of women now participating in the Olympics

139
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
And the Cold War

140
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
You know the Soviet Union and the US

141
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
A lot of posturing there and there was this Psych

142
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Fear

143
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Not very merited it

144
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
It turns out that

145
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Maybe the Soviets were

146
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Taking men

147
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
And putting them into

148
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Female athletic

149
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
To win more medals

150
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Or that the US was doing that also

151
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
And so what started

152
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Were these things that everyone calls

153
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
The nude parade

154
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
What is that

155
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
So women

156
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
Would line up wearing bras and panties

157
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
And they would go in front of

158
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Three doctors

159
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Cement

160
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
And I had to lower their underpants

161
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
And are you serious

162
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,279
Yes and they were examined palpated and measured

163
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
And

164
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
This makes me very uncomfortable

165
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah

166
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,215
Sewing base so invasive invasive is the first word that comes to mind

167
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
So this is happening all throughout the 60

168
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
People start to complain

169
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Brightly and the

170
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Iaaf

171
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Which is the International Association of Athletics

172
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,807
Confederations and the international Olympic Committee

173
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Both come under criticism

174
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Anto

175
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
In the late 19th

176
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
They come up with another approach

177
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Another

178
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Okay and that's a chromosome

179
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Body test

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Spell scrape from the inside of the cheek

181
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
A place under microscope

182
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
And then tested for x's and y's

183
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
Dog spot showed up only on female test anybody who has

184
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
XX

185
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:01,087
Is okay cuz that supposedly goes female and anybody with something other than XX

186
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Is

187
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
If they find a y chromosome in there that means you your mail theoretically less invasive

188
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
I have to pull down their underwear

189
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
And way more precise the idea

190
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
At that point was

191
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,751
Will Ohio see a 1968 said that the chromosome test

192
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
Quote indicates quite definitively the sex of a person

193
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Except

194
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
When it does

195
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
Like we talked about in our last episode there is a gene on the Y chromosome that if you have it and if it turns on you will

196
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Likely become a male

197
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
But

198
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
There are a lot of XY women

199
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
In the world

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,215
These are women who had a y chromosome which is associated with male but that little Jean it didn't turn on

201
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
Converse so you can have XX males meaning that little piece of a y chromosome got onto an ex

202
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,479
There are all of these different chromosomal like aberrations youku

203
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Xxxx

204
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
You have two extra access when you can have three extra taxes

205
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
As a woman

206
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
As a female yeah

207
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,327
You could be xxy xyy Easter perfectly healthy people

208
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
It runs the gamut you could have

209
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,519
Are fertility issues or developmental issues or were or no issues at all and tow the debate was

210
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
You know there are a lot of

211
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Geneticist

212
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
An endocrinologist who are saying

213
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Sex

214
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Isn't determined just

215
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Buy chromosomes

216
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
Determined by hormones and by physiology and

217
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
You know

218
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
Totally getting away from gender which is even more complicated but

219
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
Just because you

220
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Don't have access

221
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Doesn't mean that you are

222
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
A woman

223
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
And eventually all of the Sport's governing bodies

224
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,751
Came around to that conclusion and by 2000 everybody was like no more chromosome testing

225
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
In fact the World Federation that governs track and field has voted to scrap all testing for gender

226
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
This moment where

227
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
It looks like gender testing is going to go away

228
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Cold War is Over those fears

229
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Zircon

230
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Maybe we didn't need it anymore

231
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
But then this

232
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,511
Other idea walked into the room that

233
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
Actually been there all along

234
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
This idea of

235
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Fairness

236
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Because the fact of the matter is

237
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
If you compare male athletes to female athletes

238
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
Pretty much every track and field event except for a few

239
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Is a big difference in performance

240
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Like take the 800m

241
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,367
Soccer World Record women's record is 1 minute 53-28

242
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
Where is the men's World Record

243
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Alarm 1:00

244
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Almost 13 seconds fast

245
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,495
In fact I talk to HR some background to one female athletes

246
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
World champion one of us women in the world and she said

247
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,199
Her fastest mile is regularly beaten by like a good high school boy

248
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
I'm so if you're a female athlete

249
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
Or even like a spectator who's watching the sport you want to make sure that females and males aren't race

250
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Other

251
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
And so what you saw

252
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,399
When this sort of like organized gender testing went away

253
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
Is that whenever someone that runs really fast

254
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
There's finger-pointing

255
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
And it's all came to a head in 2009

256
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
So that we go down to Trackside off all that excitement as the women try and gather themselves called the 808 is fine

257
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
On August 19th of that year a South African runner just 18 caster semenya

258
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
Virginia weather

259
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Just crushes

260
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Chesterfield

261
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
On the final lap she wins by

262
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Is soma

263
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
What is the wealthiest

264
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
What am I to seconds

265
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
And almost immediately after the race

266
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
My conclusion was

267
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Something

268
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Something's going on here there's something not right

269
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,391
There was just a thought that there was a problem oh yeah yeah

270
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
This is Madeline Payton the PHD candidate in sociology and an Olympian for Australia she ran against

271
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Semenya in that heat

272
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
Is she since become a big defender of Pastor but she says that the time

273
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Because the menus times recruiting

274
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
So quickly because she was kicking the field ass like so totally

275
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
People around me with talking about heaven

276
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Spinning room is it spreading what were the people around you saying is she a man

277
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
She just looks like a man

278
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Cuz she's a tomboy

279
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
It wasn't that I was like

280
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
I didn't hold a strong opinion about it I just

281
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Like I just want the audible I have to

282
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
To do with it and make it go away

283
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
And so you had gotten to the point where you were opposed to Castor compito I was opposed to cast a competing

284
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Almost immediately

285
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
In Berlin

286
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,431
Over the next 24 hours she says the rumors got louder and louder basically like a

287
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Cacophonous

288
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Level in Berlin last night but the drama had to do less with who won the race then who was

289
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
And whether they should have been happening in the media is whether one of the runners should be

290
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,863
In the men's or women's race

291
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,447
Is she in the new world champion of the women's 800-meter race

292
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
That's when

293
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
The iwf

294
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Passports

295
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Governing body

296
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
The autoclave claimed that they had no

297
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
Choice but to announce something at that point

298
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
But yes

299
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
They were going to investigate caster semenya

300
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
Because they had concerns about her sexual development

301
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Effigy

302
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Investigation

303
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Proven

304
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Physically

305
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
He's not a female

306
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Daily Beast

307
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
He'll name

308
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
4D result

309
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Beijing today

310
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
It was one of those things I think with us

311
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Looking back I feel like

312
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
It makes me sad

313
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Yeah it really makes me sad

314
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
What ended up happening to caster semenya

315
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,039
Wells ijas banter there all these closed-door meetings in Xi'an Tracy like a year

316
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
What the audible app

317
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Testing

318
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,695
Reveals about semenya is physiological makeup never has been confirmed actually

319
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
Emerge from all the mishegoss is that

320
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
In the end iaaf

321
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Recommitted to gender

322
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,983
Trying to figure out some

323
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
Clearbright measurable

324
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Way

325
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
To draw a line

326
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Between

327
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
Male and female choose. Two classifications for a competition

328
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Men's events in women's

329
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
This means we need to be clear about the company

330
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Syria

331
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
But those two cats

332
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
And the way they decided now to

333
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
Clear was no longer about chromosomes

334
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
No more medieval nude parade in

335
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Stead

336
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
They were going to look at hormone

337
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Specifically

338
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Testosterone

339
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
Either naturally occurring

340
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
Or artificially inserted into the body

341
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Provides

342
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Significant

343
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Performance

344
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Advantage

345
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
I think there is little

346
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
The idea was

347
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,719
We know that testosterone causes muscles that are like faster stronger leaner

348
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,303
And that men have 10 to 30 times more testosterone in women

349
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Which is a byproduct of having testes

350
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Enter the concern was in these women the

351
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Have that

352
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Why Jean

353
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Either that they might have

354
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
The internal testes that having descended or like a ganado streak like some reproductive tissue that would be

355
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
Emitting testosterone giving them some sort of mail like advantage

356
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,367
Antonio in 2011 the

357
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
The iaaf

358
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Besides that

359
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
They will institute a test for eye test

360
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Gastrin levels

361
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
And so if the testosterone levels Falls

362
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
With within quote the mail range

363
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Then there to be barred

364
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,519
And this is the first time I try and put a number on it they say that you're

365
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,359
Testosterone levels if they're greater than 10 animals

366
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Our leader

367
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
You cannot run animals

368
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,247
I know what does that even mean

369
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Put into place

370
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,343
And this is the rule that Duty bumps into

371
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
And

372
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Ultimately

373
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Pushes back against

374
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
That part of the story

375
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
After the break

376
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
I'm kelley-ross calling from King George V

377
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887

Process

384
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Additional support for Radiolab

385
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Is provided by the outfit

386
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:04,063
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

387
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
And I'm here because I need your help

388
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
And I request

389
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
For those of you who

390
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
We spend a lot of time with kids parents

391
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887
Aunts and uncles teachers about what we're calling

392
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Tiny moments

393
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Brilliant

394
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,287
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

395
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
It just means you read back and say

396
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Wow

397
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Maybe it was the moment that I

398
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
I kid you been reading to 4 month started reading back

399
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Do you

400
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

401
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

402
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,791
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

403
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
We're interested in the

404
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Epic moments where

405
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
Kid does something super smart

406
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,727
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

407
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
If you have a story

408
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
T-shirt with us

409
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079

And that's radiolab.org / brilliant

413
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Thank you so much

414
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,447
We're back I Molly Webster this is gonads episode 4

415
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
With Indian Runner dutee Chand

416
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
So when Duty shows up in 2014

417
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
When they

418
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
Take her in for a secret gender test

419
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Because she's doing so well

420
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
It is to test

421
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
4 height

422
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
The Athletics Federation of India

423
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Decided she did not

424
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Count as a woman

425
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,511
Are natural testosterone levels were too high and so

426
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
We did wait what you need

427
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Who gets banned

428
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
Indian Seneca

429
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
I was just called five three days before the commonwealth games begin

430
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
And I was told that I couldn't participate because of hyperandrogenism

431
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
Had you ever even heard about like the idea that women could have high testosterone or something called

432
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,391
Yes I want to see Bella I've never hyperandrogenism

433
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
Give out admit so not talk about it

434
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
Mishka

435
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,376
No I didn't know anything about it will be duties first thought was

436
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Images

437
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Basically this is b*******

438
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,288
My family and my friends and my fans kept saying to me

439
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
You must be the victim of some kind of politics

440
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,176
You were running so well and that's why someone's trying to stop you

441
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
So

442
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:44,320
She gets her own doctor and she does the test again

443
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
OSHA test results in this test we're the same

444
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
And I

445
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Started to believe that there was something wrong with my body

446
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
She told me that

447
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
She

448
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Tried

449
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
4 days

450
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
Scared cuz I didn't know anything about it

451
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
She said I felt naked

452
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
I'm a human being but I felt like I was an animal

453
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation

454
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
In our village

455
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,464
Children are born at home and no one goes to the hospital to deliver baby

456
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
Had I been born at the hospital maybe the doctor would have said what was going on inside my body and I would have probably understood

457
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Did this better as a child

458
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Animatic

459
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:39,104
Cuz I wasn't the case I was born at home and raised like a girl and there were no issues surrounding the

460
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,272
When suddenly the question was raised about my gender calling me a male

461
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Is very confusing

462
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,184
How could I have just become a man one day

463
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Ultimately

464
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Duty decides I'm going to fight

465
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Andrew says she sends a letter appealing herb and the Athletics

466
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Federation of India

467
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
She writes

468
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
I was born a woman

469
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
Reared up as a woman

470
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
I identify as a woman

471
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
And I believe I should be allowed to compete with other women

472
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Many of whom are either taller than me

473
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Or come from more privileged background

474
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
Things that most certainly give them an edge over me

475
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,512
And eventually Duty ends up at the court of arbitration for sport

476
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Is that a

477
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
Higher body than the IA

478
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
AF it's like the it's like the Supreme Court

479
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Sport

480
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Aaron golden calf

481
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,456
So on the one side you have duty and on the other side you have the iaaf iwi ask governs trackinfo

482
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
Around

483
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
The world are the weight breaks down is

484
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
Duties essentially making two main arguments

485
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
The first is that the hyperandrogenism rule is

486
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Discriminatory

487
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Discriminatory towards women

488
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,584
Twitch the iaaf essentially says

489
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Yeah kind of is

490
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
But

491
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
We're doing it for a reason

492
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
And that reason outweighs

493
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
The risk

494
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,104
Definitely there's definitely an argument that if you eradicated gender

495
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
You would be screwing over hundreds of thousands of women

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
They're sort of

497
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,784
Their big thing is like listen

498
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
As a society

499
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
Even in this court case we all seem to agree we want to separate men and women

500
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
We need to figure out some way to do this

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Duties response to that

502
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,144
Her second argument is sure okay fine we need to separate the Sexes but

503
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
The way you chosen to do it is not solid you have this number 10 animals for leader which is supposedly the high

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
High-end of testosterone for women

505
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,896
But if you actually look at the data

506
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,736
They're crazy variability like you will see women with levels that were like

507
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Less than one

508
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
And levels that were Bus 30

509
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
Which is typically considered 30 like considered high for men

510
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
So there was this

511
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,792
Dick the studies that came out where one study was like

512
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,424
We've we look at all these different testosterone levels and

513
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
You know there's an average for men in there's an average for women and they're on different ends of the spectrum but we saw is

514
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
There's totally overlap

515
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,432
It's not like one and the other at never the two shall meet that like there's

516
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,992
That that some women go high and some and go low

517
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
And you've got

518
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,416
You know men with low testosterone who are world-class Champions and you've got women with high testosterone that never win

519
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
It's just it's not always

520
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,024
Clear the role that testosterone has in performance

521
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,632
Oh really I thought it was I thought that was well-established today the testosterone will make

522
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:46,752
Faster likes and then what steroids do there is agreement that synthetic testosterone

523
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Steroids

524
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Ramsa performance

525
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,640
Helping both male and female athletes jump higher

526
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
And run faster

527
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
But there's

528
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,504
Vehement disagreement about whether natural

529
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
Osterone one's own test

530
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
That same effect

531
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Why why wouldn't it

532
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Well that's a really good question

533
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
The

534
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
Idle AF Witnesses

535
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Argue

536
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
That

537
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,376
Logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely to work the way since

538
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Testosterone does

539
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
But

540
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,568
Some scientists argue that a sudden burst of testosterone is much different than sort

541
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,920
A natural level of testosterone that your body is calibrated to

542
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
The long and the short

543
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
The science is surprisingly can test

544
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Furthermore Duty argued

545
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,368
If you really want to talk about fairness

546
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
You need to look Beyond sex

547
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
They're all sorts of advantages that

548
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
People have you know some people are born with

549
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
Increased aerobic capacity and others with resistance to fatigue or super long limbs or

550
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
Flexible joints

551
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Large hands and feet

552
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
And other people have disadvantages like Duty said I came from a village and in

553
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Southeast India

554
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,968
Where I raced for years with no shoes

555
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
And only had

556
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Vegetables and rice

557
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,856
You know like if you want things to be fair

558
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,928
Then like we should all have the exact same

559
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
The exact same coaching sis

560
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
The exact same shoes

561
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
But the idle AF say well that sound about

562
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,240
The division between men and women If Sports is / men and women we need to find out what the thing is

563
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Divide 9 Lima

564
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
July

565
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Two thousand

566
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
The court of arbitration for sport rule today

567
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
That dutee Chand

568
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,088
Could continue to race the spider higher-than-normal levels of testosterone

569
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Court rules that Duty can continue to race

570
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
And they say to the I was like you don't have enough scientific evidence

571
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
To have is hyperandrogenism

572
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Go where found that

573
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
Let us know what you find

574
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,032
And

575
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,896
Descent through this whole controversy at least a year goes by Duty never stops running

576
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,760
If my Coach told me no matter what just keep training

577
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
Define puzzled I wake up at 5 a.m. train from 6 to 10

578
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
Hit the ground again from 4 to 6

579
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
Picks for the 3rd round

580
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Training with the coach

581
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,608
And the summer after the ruling at a big International meet in Kazakhstan

582
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
Duty ran 11.3 in the hundred

583
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
Setting an Indian National Record

584
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
And

585
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,200
She makes the Olympics

586
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,576
Becoming the first-ever Indian woman to qualify for the Rio Olympics in the hundred

587
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Since 1980

588
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
Meanwhile the iaaf

589
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
I just like the court asked

590
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Go back to the drawing board

591
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
And they commissioned their own study

592
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
And last summer it was published

593
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,032
What they did was analyzed blood samples from a couple thousand

594
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Athletes at the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and what they were looking for was to see if the women

595
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,784
With high testosterone outperforms the women with low testosterone

596
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,904
And what they found is that if you are a female Runner

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
Who runs the 400m and 800m the 400 hurdles

598
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
By the mile

599
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
You

600
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,936
Are conferred an advantage with high testosterone levels

601
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
In only those events and only those event

602
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
There's also a throwing event

603
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
And one other

604
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
Having high testosterone levels

605
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,016
Conferred an advantage of like 1.8

606
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
Percent and a half percent

607
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Faster

608
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Or like 2% to 4% rough

609
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
And just to say like if you're a runner

610
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
1%

611
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
Could be like two tenths of a second

612
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
110

613
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Which is which is off and how races are decided

614
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,080
And these studies these distances are the higher distances these distances the middle.

615
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Middle-distance

616
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Yeah

617
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:12,480
Sprint not not the Sprints and not the long with their study finds is that the Sprints

618
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,832
Do not you do not get an advantage from testosterone the long-distance

619
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
No Advantage from testosterone

620
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
Deez middle distant races

621
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
Seemingly an advantage from testosterone and

622
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
A throwing event

623
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Would a hammer throw

624
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
What a f****** mess

625
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,800
We started with like the nude parade and now where we end up with at the line that we've chosen to draw is

626
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Hinze's

627
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
Middle distance races

628
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
That's where we're going to like make a big deal about

629
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Trying to separate out the sex

630
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,648
It feels like yes it feels like everyone's just arguing over change at this point

631
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,208
Even since that study was published

632
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,584
The data has been called into question and there's a call for retraction and they published there's a bunch of

633
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Data errors

634
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
The author still stand behind the study and in fact I double AF is now using it as the basis for a new test

635
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Classroom rules

636
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
They introduced

637
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
This past April

638
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
We reach out to the I was a few times and didn't hear back

639
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
But

640
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
I mean right now we're arguing about test

641
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
Testosterone but I think it's a bigger issue here is that

642
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
We're like

643
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
Coming into a moment as Society

644
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
Where were more and more open to gender fluidity

645
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
But if we all agreed on a whole

646
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
That that

647
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
It's that it's unfair to group

648
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Women with men in

649
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Sports

650
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Then we do have to answer a real question

651
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,336
Which is how do I keep

652
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
The dichotomy the binary and Athletics

653
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
All the rest of the world is changing

654
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,088
And what you see with Duty or any of these female athletes is there sort of caught

655
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
At the place where these two worlds meet

656
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
Hard place to find yourself

657
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Lamborghini

658
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
What's the name of Adam when he died

659
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
Duty told me when this whole thing blew up

660
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
She was only 18 years old

661
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
Is boys and girls are falling for each other and there was a

662
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
The guy who fell hard for me and

663
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
I fell for him too

664
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,064
We used to talk a lot on the phone and

665
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Thought that one day when we got older we get married

666
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Peking duck

667
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
1114 Mason

668
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,048
But when the news in 2014 started appearing everywhere

669
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,864
He started asking me who I was for real

670
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
But I do like that

671
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
He said if you're a boy then how can the two of us

672
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Both boys

673
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
Stay together in the future how will our dreams of having children or creating a family ever come true

674
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Eventually I did tell him that

675
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,064
The results confirmed that I had hyperandrogenism

676
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
And I asked him

677
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
Are you going to love me and marry me

678
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Or not

679
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
He said

680
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
Name app

681
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,216
I don't love you anymore and I can't marry you because my family doesn't approve of our relationship

682
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
So I said fine

683
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
So he forgot me and I forgot him too

684
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,296
After that guy left me there haven't been any other guys that like me anymore

685
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
A lot of girls have started like

686
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Liking me

687
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
And a lot of them say that they want to settle down with me

688
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
How do you feel about that

689
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Guess the logo

690
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
I guess I feel happy and sad

691
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,336
Images of my childhood dreams of having a husband creating a family with him might not come true

692
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
I want to see all these girls still attracted to me

693
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
I often wonder

694
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,480
If I could make a home with a girl

695
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,880
In India only boys and girls get married girls don't marry girls

696
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
It was more acceptable to marry girl in India do you think you'd want to do that

697
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Happy Thanksgiving

698
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:14,656
Right now I haven't thought about it and I'm focusing on my sports career

699
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
But

700
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,264
After I'm done with my career I am going to need someone to spend my life with

701
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Birthright

702
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,200
There is any guy that likes me I would marry him and settle down

703
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,832
But if there are any guys interested in me and girls still like me then I would settle down with a girl

704
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Mallorca

705
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Whoever likes me

706
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
I would spend my life with them

707
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
