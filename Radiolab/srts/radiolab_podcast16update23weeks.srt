1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:06,656
Is Jesse this is an episode coming up that we originally had about 3 years ago

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,728
But the issues in here

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
Seem to be serviced in the air

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Still

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
Part of it kind of an ongoing

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:19,200
NeverEnding National conversation touches on some cases before The Supreme Court

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
So

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:26,880
We certainly have been able to stop thinking about it so we thought we would share this with you again and at the very end of the hour

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
We have a little update

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
Super interesting

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
To hear this

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,656
Are you awake

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
Listening to Radiolab from WNYC

14
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,944
How can you hear me

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Yeah okay good

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
So we're just doing this because

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,160
Because that article you wrote we hope you'd one of the most amazing things I've ever read

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,768
Okay I'm Jedi Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and today

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
A story about

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
A decision

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:12,448
About a decision that we as human beings we've only recently begun to consider

22
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,544
There are stories like this elsewhere but somehow

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
Not too many

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
So we're going to devote the entire hour to just this one story which I think is a first pressing it is and the story comes to us from

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,112
Woman named Kelly Benham she's a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times in Florida

26
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
Maybe going to do this is chronologically just sort of

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Across time

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Where were you and who

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
What did you want to do

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
When I decide to have a baby with you one of those people who

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Ever since you were young

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
You knew that you would be a mom

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,824
Yeah I did but I wasn't like I didn't play with a lot of dolls or babysit

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
I bet I always just kind of had this weird

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Certainty that

36
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
I have a daughter

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm a daughter not a son

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,648
Maybe son too but I don't know I think I was I would have a daughter and a sword had this image of her in my head

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Image

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
Like really feisty mischievous

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Dark hair

42
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Dirty face

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Okay we've left princess lanzhou not a princess at all

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
Weimaraner dog chaser

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
I really want to have a baby

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
I wanted one very badly but I just

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
Couldn't see how it made sense for me to be the father

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
That's Tom French also journalists at the Tampa Bay Times or he was a dime he and Kelly have been dating for a few years

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Years but he was a good 10 years older than her

50
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
I had two kids

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Suns

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Approaching the end of college

53
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,840
And I was ready to travel I wanted to see you Spain and

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Greeson the world going to err on the

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
On the cruise ship where you get to be the mail pokermaster whatever you need or I would have an issue with Springsteen

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
Bring me falling Springsteen around Europe

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
I've made up my mind

58
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
No more kids but she was insistent I stuck to it she saw our daughter very clearly oh yeah

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
Saw that I was destined to be that little girl's father

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
And was that at happy gentle disagreement or the other kind

61
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
I was brutal

62
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,608
He broke up and when we worked at the same place there's kind of invisible line and then

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
The Newsroom that neither of us would cross the mailboxes

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
It really was alive it was a horrible time we called the dark era the dark.

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
It was the worst Halloween section of Target

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
I am my son's and I have loved Halloween forever I love it when I was a little kid and

67
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
I just wanted to see what they have anything new cuz I had

68
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
You know I usually check out there gargoyles now There Staffing

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
So I just was kind of walking through the Section browsing and then something

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Just stopped me in my tracks

71
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Apparently was it was really like kind of a lightning bolt Epiphany just so wait a minute maybe you are

72
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
Thinking about the straight you're acting as though

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
You're 80

74
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
And then it hit me that

75
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Nobody knows how much time they have

76
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
To have a child is to embrace a future that you can't control

77
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
Remember those words so I had to come to Jesus meeting with myself among the Gargoyles

78
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
And that was when I realized I need to just take a step back and try to restart the conversation with

79
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
You know I went home and wrote me this long letter and I just

80
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
I was over by that point on

81
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
I wasn't looking back

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
So you know over a few months with a little while

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,487
They patched things up eventually got married and started trying to make a baby

84
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
We thought that this would just happen right away

85
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
And then of course it didn't

86
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,751
You're trying and trying the regular way she took drugs that make you

87
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Drop a bunch of eggs at one time after that the turkey baster method there's like kind of a process that they walk you through

88
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
After turkey baster IVF

89
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Yeah

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
I never thought that it would get that far but it would go farther because after trying IVF three times

91
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
Stetson work so they said we can try with an egg donor meaning you get a friend's would be willing to donate the egg take the egg put it in the day

92
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
Dish forcibly impregnated with Tom sperm then you insert the egg into your kind of the Magic Bullet

93
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Infertility

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Kind of like

95
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
You don't know what's wrong with your car you just replace the whole engine

96
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Kelly asked a good friend to be an egg donor they implanted the egg

97
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
Shortly after she took a pregnancy test

98
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,783
I said way too early it's at the line was super super faint

99
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Wasn't even sure I could see it at all

100
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,951
So I took a photograph of the pregnancy test and I put it into Photoshop

101
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
And I actually had to dial up the contrast

102
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
To make the the line appear that is everything

103
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
This is so high-tech right

104
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
I was like oh my God I think there's two lines there

105
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,479
So I waited and I and I did it a second time

106
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
And then I

107
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
But I told Tom

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
Did you go into like the expectant parent mode and

109
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Oh yeah

110
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Touch up the paint

111
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
You know I patch the little holes in the wall everything was perfect everything

112
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Was absolutely

113
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Perfect

114
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Until it wasn't

115
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
5 months into her pregnancy 20 weeks which is just about halfway cuz a full-term is 40 Kelly was at a park

116
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
Playing with her dog and I just felt a little bit

117
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Weird

118
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
And

119
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Just started to bleed

120
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
But not a lot

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
But

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,143
Any amount of blood is not a good thing and I called the doctor's office and they didn't seem too concerned they're like

123
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
Yeah you probably want to go to the hospital and get that checked and I went to pick her up and

124
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
By the time we got to the hospital she was in a lot of pain

125
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Cramping cramping cramping I knew something was really really wrong they got me nowhere

126
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
What is wheelchairs they wheeled me into the surf triage room and by that point like blood was just

127
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,279
Coming out of me chunks of blood coming out of me and I didn't know I thought it was baby Parts like falling

128
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
And I thought I'm having a miscarriage like the baby's going to drop out on the floor

129
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
I was throwing up

130
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,591
And then the doctor came in and he looked scared

131
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Does the doctor say something or what happens

132
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
The doctor

133
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
Explain to me quietly there was something it was making it difficult

134
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
To stop Kelly's bleeding

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
And if they couldn't stop it we might lose Kelly

136
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,279
And Kelly heard the doctor say this and I need to tell you Kelly is the toughest

137
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Most Fearless person I've ever known

138
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
But she grabbed my arm

139
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
It's hard as anyone has ever grabbed my arm and I remember just

140
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Don't let me down

141
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Please don't let me die

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
It was terrifying and then

143
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Sandpoint they

144
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
They brought in an ultrasound machine to see what was going on with the baby and I assume the baby was long dead I'm going to have her baby Parts on the floor

145
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Or I didn't know

146
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:33,279
And they hooked up his machine and they were moving on and around and around and trying to pick up heartbeat in there was nothing

147
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Adam

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
I was apologizing to Tom

149
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
I'm sorry like you know I just knew the baby was gone

150
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Then all of a sudden

151
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
There was just this heartbeat

152
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,159
Recorded on her cell phone

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Baby's heartbeat super super fast so it sounds like a rabbit or something

154
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
Yeah this heartbeat pops up and then there's the baby and you can see it and she looks fine she's too

155
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Totally oblivious she says right there

156
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,431
Now I thought oh my God I'm going to watch her die

157
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,831
I'm going to watch you die in front of me Anna

158
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,207
Then they started just pumping me full of drugs to try to get this labor stop

159
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
There's this drug called magnesium sulfate in one of the effects of it is it just makes you

160
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Can a boil from the inside

161
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
But eventually

162
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,519
They got the contraction stop they got the bleeding stopped they put me in the hospital room

163
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
And they said

164
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Get to 24 weeks

165
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Cuz that's that's the limit

166
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
So 4 more weeks

167
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Yeah

168
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,831
Sounds like they got a line in the sand like you must get to 24 or there's no

169
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,951
Ny-24 what's special about them that number they told me that

170
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
24 weeks is kind of pill abuse

171
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Definition of viability

172
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
That sort of grew out of

173
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
When they were

174
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Fighting out

175
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Roe v Wade

176
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
Example the Court ruled that a woman who commits an abortion on herself is guilty of no crime against

177
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Stories I understand a robber

178
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
In Roe v Wade the Supreme Court was trying to strike this balance they wanted to protect a woman's right to choose as we

179
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
But they also want to say that there are limits to that right

180
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
If there is some moment in the development of the fetus in the course of this pregnant

181
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
We cross this line in

182
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,959
At least no longer just about to women's rights now you have to think about the state's interest in The Unborn Child

183
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
The problem of course is weird you draw that line

184
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
Not now that is the million-dollar question

185
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Duke University

186
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
So that kind of bass

187
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Gas at that point the best

188
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
Medical objective standard that the justices could come up with the 1973 was

189
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Liability

190
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,583
And the word viable in this case means can it survive on its own

191
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
Outside of the woman's womb a fetus is developed enough that you can take it out of the mother's womb and it can still see

192
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Survive

193
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,871
That liquid suggested is the point when it is no longer okay to have an abortion

194
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Because across that line a fetus is

195
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Quotes viable

196
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Send the question was when does a fetus cross that line

197
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
When can it survive on its own

198
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,255
Well we begin but you got this in our brief with the development of the

199
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Human

200
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Embryo

201
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
Here's where you get to the 24-week thing what ended up happening was the court considered what was known about fetal development

202
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
And their trucks that show this

203
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
Feel like this 3 weeks a fetus has brain and heart begin to develop a tweaks nerve fibers 13 to 16 weeks the fetus begin

204
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
Removing them kick at 23 weeks some fetuses respond to familiar sounds like a mother's voice and at 24 weeks

205
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,367
Air sacs form in the lungs

206
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
And thinking was maybe that's the point

207
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
The minimum point

208
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Where the fetus is viable straps breathe on its own butt

209
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
This was just a theoretical idea

210
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
No one was testing it no one was trying to take the fetus

211
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Out of a mother at 24 weeks to see if it would survive

212
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
In fact

213
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
Throughout the 70s and 80s most hospitals according to Kelly

214
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,759
Drew the line of viability back a little bit farther

215
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
28 weeks

216
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
And that is because

217
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Somewhere around the

218
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,695
28th week of gestation the lungs start to produce

219
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Eye fluid called surfactant

220
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,839
Which prevents the lungs from collapsing and sticking together between breaths

221
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
That's a really important thing

222
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,239
Super a long time the actual viability line not the theoretical one

223
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
What's 28 weeks

224
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
But then

225
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
In the late seventies someone invented an artificial lung surfactant kind of a slippery white stuff that they shoot

226
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Down the ventilator tube in the baby's born and that combined with

227
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,415
IV nutrition new super small ventilators moved the line of viability back

228
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
2 round where does now

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Where does now is

230
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
Generally around 24 but here's the thing depending on what hospital you're in

231
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,191
In what doctor is on call sometimes it can be 23

232
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
25

233
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Cases 22 so

234
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Given modern technology

235
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
Imagine says need a one-day the line could jump way back

236
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Will make things really

237
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Tricky if for example we get to the point where modern signs able to develop an artificial womb

238
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Does viability start at the points of a fertilized egg

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
The standard is

240
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
The point at which the developing child can actually survive outside of the womb using any psychological intervention

241
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
Apple that is a slippery line indeed

242
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
They said

243
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Get to 24 weeks

244
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Cuz that's the limit

245
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Which made the doctors have to pump Kelly full of drugs

246
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Keep her feet elevated for at least

247
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Another 4 weeks

248
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
But I just

249
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Kept going into labor

250
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
In and out of it and they felt like they couldn't hold it off anymore

251
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
And at 23 weeks and 4 days

252
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
A doctor tells her that

253
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
There's nothing more they can do the baby is going to come

254
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
A day

255
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
Maybe to a guy comes in

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Adam

257
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
I hate he

258
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,359
He seems a little uncomfortable like this was not pleasant for him

259
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,479
He said you know your baby's probably coming in 24 to 48 hours and we know how hard

260
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,623
You work to have his baby and we know how much you want this baby and we assume that you want everything done

261
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
Does that mean we have no idea

262
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
So we said

263
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,535
We're not sure if we do when everything done paint the picture for us doctor

264
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
And he said

265
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,447
Now there's about a 53% chance that the baby will die no matter what we do

266
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
53 yeah

267
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Whatever we do whatever we do

268
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
There was a small chance that she could be fine

269
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
What were those chances

270
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
About 20

271
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
I felt like like 20%

272
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
You know it

273
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
It's not a

274
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
It's not a possibility it seems like a like a reasonable

275
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,791
It seems like worth a gamble until you really think about what the 80% means I mean

276
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
He could be on a ventilator for the rest of her life

277
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
She have a massive

278
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
Bleed in her brain and it was like eat holes in her brain and

279
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Affect her ability to think

280
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
Or talk or walk

281
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
She could

282
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Pretty good chance she could be blind

283
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Or death

284
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
And

285
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
There was no way for the doctors to predict

286
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
But the doctor said no is it when the baby came

287
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
The world

288
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
It would need a ton of medical

289
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
It may even need to be revived and so the question for the

290
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Kelly was

291
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
Do they want the doctors to do that they want them to pursue every measure possible or

292
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
No

293
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Just left

294
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Nature take its course

295
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
And he said it would be we should decide

296
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,967
Before the baby came because once the baby came

297
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
We saw the baby it would be really hard to say no

298
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
So if if no was going to be the answer we need to just say that before the baby came

299
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
The worst night ever

300
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
You trying to make up your mind

301
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
About what

302
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
What's right

303
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
Like what we be torturing this baby

304
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
For nothing

305
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
We didn't want her to be born out of life that she would

306
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Hate us for having

307
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,759
There have been instances where children with birth defects are genetic diseases

308
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
I filed wrongful life suits

309
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
Essentially claiming they should have never been born

310
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
We had to really debate what was

311
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
In her best interest

312
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
What would she want

313
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
I started to

314
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
Really struggle with

315
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,191
Whether I was being selfish whether I had already pushed too far

316
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
And this was like

317
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
God or the universe

318
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Pushing back

319
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Warehouse

320
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Marriage might break up

321
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
We lose our ability to

322
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
Try again for another child I felt like

323
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,135
I might get a baby but I would lose everything else and

324
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
I think I got pretty close

325
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Uno

326
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
All night as we're talking this through and

327
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
I'm trying to figure it out

328
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
We could hear

329
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
The baby's heartbeat to the monitor

330
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Baby was letting us know all night right here I'm right here

331
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Where you had to say yes

332
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Are now out loud

333
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
I will ask for second opinion or

334
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
A second opinion but another console we had some more questions

335
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
And a nurse practitioner from the NICU came to the room yes my name is Diane lysel I'm a neonate

336
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
Little nurse practitioner this is the next day had asked

337
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
To speak to someone again and instead of just

338
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Fighting numbers in statistics

339
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,647
I don't give numbers different for each baby she kind of started to paint a picture

340
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
This is what I've seen I've been doing this 30 years

341
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
But more importantly I also told them that

342
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
It wasn't

343
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Oh yes or no decision

344
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
She said you know you don't have to decide right now

345
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
They could have the baby

346
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Baby came out crying

347
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,127
An active then we should do everything we can for the baby

348
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
But the baby came out blue and length intraventricular hemorrhage

349
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
We could stop

350
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
We didn't have to keep

351
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Going

352
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,975
Something goes horribly wrong we can withdraw the support and then you can hold her baby until it dies

353
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
But you can give your baby a chance and see how it goes

354
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
In other words

355
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
In a very real way

356
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
They could give this decision

357
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
To the baby

358
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
That same night

359
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
I was feeling like I'm just uncomfortable

360
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,503
Couple hours later discomfort turns the pain finally a doctor came in and was like

361
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Yeah your labor we have to go right now so that it was like super super quick or

362
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Light shot in spine cutting me open and then

363
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
Oh my God there's a third

364
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Person in this room

365
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
But not really not quite almost I mean

366
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Trousseau

367
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
So early

368
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
What did she look like

369
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Why didn't see her

370
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Then

371
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,855
I just saw like her kind of Wiz buy an incubator

372
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
And she just doing a little dark smear

373
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
And a hat

374
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
And in did you make it to 24 weeks

375
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Swimmer one day shift

376
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
23 weeks

377
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
And 6 days

378
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,455
Will be back in just a moment hi this is Kelly Friend

379
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
OK Google

380
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Radiolab supported

381
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
I'm parked by the National Science Foundation

382
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
Science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan

383
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,423
Sound at www.slha.org

384
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,031
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

385
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show and I've request

386
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

387
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

388
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
So did something

389
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

390
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you

391
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
Suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the math class

392
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
Reading music in the margin of their geometry homework

393
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story with us

394
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us again that's

395
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,520
Radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

396
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab today we're spending the entire hour on a single story

397
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:27,072
We saw in the Tampa Bay Times Kelley Benham a journalist published an unbelievably

398
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Wonderful set of articles

399
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,704
About her and her husband Tom French was also a journalist

400
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
They had a baby

401
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
Except their baby came very

402
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,896
Very early so full term as we mention is 40 weeks their daughter arrived

403
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,504
23 weeks and 6 days would be just a little bit over halfway

404
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
No just to put that in context

405
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,416
If a baby is born before 22 weeks it's generally considered a miscarriage

406
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Pretty much no doctor is going to interview

407
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,096
If a baby is born after 25 weeks

408
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
They've been all kinds of studies which show that doctors then feel morally obliged to save that life no matter what the parents

409
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Say so before 22

410
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
And after 25

411
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,432
Things are pretty clear but between 22 and 25

412
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Dillon danis

413
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Gray Zone

414
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,344
This strange little liminal space between life and death

415
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
We have to answer some really tough

416
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Like

417
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Should my baby live

418
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
At what cost

419
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
Who gets to decide and ultimately Windows life

420
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Begin

421
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,288
Kelly and Tom like many parents who land in this Zone decided for the hardest question to the baby

422
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,128
The baby will tell them whether it's going to stay or whether it's going to go

423
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
So they delivered by C-section and their daughter

424
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
Sweet that boy didn't have a name was whisked off to the

425
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
Neonatal intensive care unit for the NICU

426
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Eventually they went to see her

427
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
And they need to beat her

428
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
For the first time

429
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,256
And she was

430
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Like

431
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Like weirdly perfect

432
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
She had all the parts

433
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Lisa

434
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
Long fingers

435
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Long feet

436
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
Delicate little nose and she had hair and fingernails and

437
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
Eyebrows and you all the things that they're supposed to have

438
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
But she was

439
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Translucent

440
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,048
You could just see right through you can see all the veins running on her skin you could see her heart

441
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Thumping in her chest

442
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
And her eyes were sealed shut

443
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Like a puppy

444
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
And I'm

445
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
She was

446
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Bike Meetup

447
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
She had bruises all over her body and she had a black eye

448
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
Just from the you know they were very

449
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
Careful with them when they're born but

450
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Just that very delicate handling

451
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
Kind of batteries these babies because they're so fragile

452
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
I mean it was

453
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
We are lucky to know how it's supposed to feel

454
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
I mean you want to

455
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
Believe that

456
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
The minute you meet your daughter there's going to be like

457
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,776
Butterflies Sido or like unicorns

458
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Supposed to be the best moment your life

459
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
But they were so much Terror

460
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
Inside that moment

461
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
I was terrified because

462
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,272
I love being a father my relationship with my son is

463
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
Extremely bored

464
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,928
And I was really terrified that she would be so alien

465
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Haven't been born at 23 weeks

466
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
6 days

467
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
That I wouldn't

468
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Recognize her as

469
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
My daughter

470
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,888
And I wouldn't bond with her that I was now. Thought was

471
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
Filled with the real dread

472
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Andam

473
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
I wanted to see her

474
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
I could see that

475
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
She was

476
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Only

477
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Have finished

478
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Barely a pound that point

479
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
So training my brain couldn't even process

480
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
House martial arts

481
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
And

482
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
The nurse Quinn

483
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
You can touch her you know

484
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
Stunt I didn't think I would be able to and so she had me

485
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,632
Washington Starlight my hands once Shamy do it again

486
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,216
She showed me how to reach in through this little round portal

487
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
I think you better

488
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,152
And explain how to touch her you don't rub the skin because the skin will come off if you do that when they're born that early

489
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
You just press gently

490
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
And so

491
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
The baby was lying there not with her fist but with her arms extended

492
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
The Palms open

493
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:40,000
So her right palm was right there when I reach my left hand and I just

494
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Put my

495
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
My left

496
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,912
Gently into her palm and she just

497
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
Wrapping tight and in that

498
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Moment

499
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:02,784
All my fears about not being able to bond with her washed away

500
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Panda

501
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
Oh yeah what what got to me was

502
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
How

503
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
I could be so afraid

504
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
When she was so strong

505
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
At that point to

506
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
She was the most beef

507
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
And I told her

508
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Hippie

509
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Daddy

510
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
When a baby is this early

511
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Parents and the doctors

512
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,984
Are watching very carefully trying to guess is this baby ready to be out in the world

513
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Is it going to make it

514
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
Tom says when she grabbed his finger

515
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
That wasn't just been bonding he felt

516
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Like she was saying something

517
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:09,344
She made her will very very clear to live

518
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,440
And that was a phrase We heard again and again some babies will

519
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,536
Can use a Tempe plasma cells over the first few hours and days of their life

520
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,888
That's a neonatologist we spoke to Keith Berrington get a gut feeling

521
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,704
I'm at Stanley's Allegan the nurse practitioner

522
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
After meeting the baby that

523
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
This one looks very fragile

524
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Or

525
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
This one can do it

526
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,176
Babies declared itself

527
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
What does that mean

528
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
What are you seeing

529
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
When something that premature declares itself

530
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
And here we ran into a real difference parents will often see will in a credible

531
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,024
Will and resolve doctors and nurses

532
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Nothing much

533
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
That sounds a bit too mystical for me I wouldn't take it

534
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
As there's a

535
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,240
Voice inside the baby saying I'm going to be a fighter I'm not

536
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,312
One is sick enough not to be able to fight and one isn't

537
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
Can you see a spirit in a in a kid

538
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,992
Can I think you can see if some fight I call it's Punk a lot of times

539
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
That is Tracy Howlett registered nurse

540
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:18,208
She was Kelly and Tom's primary nurse at All Children's Hospital and like everyone we spoke to on the hospital side when it comes to this issue

541
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
She chooses her words very carefully

542
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,888
Maybe try to keep things a little bit more neutral than talking about their will to live

543
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,264
Easy no baby at 23 weeks barely has folds on the outside of its brain it's Brandon. Smooth

544
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Pinellas Park

545
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,176
So who knows what it's capable of thinking or feeling well that's a difficult question in the truth is

546
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
Things like fights Punk may just boil down to physiology maybe that baby had a few more lung buds to start

547
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Start with an easier time in utero may have nothing to do with Will in fact that they be grasping the finger

548
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
Eva Peron

549
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
It's actually a reflex

550
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
The babies have a grasp reflex I never tell a parent that because they think it's an intentional

551
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
Movement because you're putting yourself in the parents had it if you've got to decide how much my going to put how much of my heart

552
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432
I'm going to pour into this little creature

553
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
If you can see something like will or something like intention if you see oh that's a person in there

554
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Maybe you don't see it

555
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,184
Maybe it's the only way you got to make this decision

556
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Is my wife the professional messages often says

557
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
We don't make

558
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
Important decisions in our life the rational reasons very often

559
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
Keith and his wife any janvier have done a huge amount of research into the ethics of extremely premature birth

560
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
But one of the primary reasons we going to talk to him

561
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Is that

562
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,736
Addition to being a neonatologist and a guy who publishes a lot of stuff in this area

563
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
He and his wife recently had a baby girl

564
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
Who is born at 24 weeks and 5 days

565
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Shwetha 720g

566
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
One and a half pounds

567
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,304
She's actually in my own and I see you

568
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Oh wow

569
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,144
I was I see the director of the unit where she was

570
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,264
So he was in his unit in the place where he usually work

571
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
He saw babies make it

572
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
Not make it and now suddenly he was

573
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Apparent in that place

574
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
And several weeks after his baby was born

575
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,856
There is a very very big complication xian she didn't move

576
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
I told for about 36 hours

577
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,488
How many thought maybe it was a little lamb

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Maybe it's time

579
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
So they decided he and his wife

580
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
To Let Her Go

581
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Peacefully

582
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
But

583
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
I went back into the NICU to see you

584
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
And something happened he look down

585
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
Any saw

586
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Her lips move

587
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Barely started sucking on the shoes of the nested put in their mouth

588
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
She was sucking on a pacifier

589
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
I was just a reflex

590
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
The most basic baby reflexes sucking reflex

591
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
He knew that

592
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
But

593
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,256
Just that movement to sucking on the zoo the

594
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Changed his mind completely when I went back to Annie and said them be constipated really need to

595
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
Continuing and give her the chance

596
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Too but you knew that

597
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,360
Suck the sucking response is not that's a fairly

598
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
Deep-brain yes is a very basic is just the brain stem is not snowing and you need a lot more than be able to suck

599
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
Look to It To Em to do well

600
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,672
As I was trying to be the parent there not many Nate elegist

601
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,768
What can you remember if the doctor and you was surprised that the father in you

602
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
Yeah I think I was actually a little

603
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Yeah I think if I do

604
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Ben Moore

605
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,032
Evidence-based and rational and scientific, I thought I could have

606
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Gone either way

607
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,384
But just as a father I couldn't do that Point Mexico

608
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
I just didn't really know how to process it

609
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
I felt like

610
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
She was

611
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:02,464
I just had this very acute sense that she had just been like a violently ripped out of my body

612
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
I could just feel where they cut her out

613
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
You know

614
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
And

615
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
Like I just wanted to put her back

616
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
Pitmaker safe

617
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Yeah yeah

618
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
And I and how these questions going through my head like

619
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
How long does she have to live for us to get a birth certificate

620
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
It has to be real

621
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Like I felt like she might die and

622
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
And like it wouldn't count

623
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
And I wouldn't be a mother

624
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
You don't even

625
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,048
Like what if she died like what would have happened

626
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
Like when we have a funeral

627
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
They make caskets a size of shoe boxes

628
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
I'm always like

629
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
So

630
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Screwed up the

631
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,056
That's the stuff you think about but your brain goes

632
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Places you just can't control or predict

633
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
And if she

634
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
I wondered like

635
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
If she knew

636
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
She really aware that I was even standing there like

637
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,392
Which is a reflex that made her got my finger

638
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
When she grabbed it and she know

639
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,536
Did you know I was there and she didn't know I was there. She wonder where I've gone

640
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
Did she feel alone and is she scared

641
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
All she could really do at that point

642
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Sit with us

643
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
And it just became this waiting game

644
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
Will continue in a moment

645
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:04,576
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and we are spending the whole hour

646
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,672
With Tampa Bay Times Reporter at Kelley Benham and her husband Tom French

647
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
A story that they're telling us

648
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Tibet this limbo

649
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,840
A a space that's that's literally between life and death

650
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
We have to tackle some really big questions yeah

651
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,264
Well there's anyone I dump when did you decide to name your daughter Juniper

652
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
About

653
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
About five days after she was born

654
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,992
Now in those 5 days pretty much everything in their lives changed

655
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
The most superficial level they began their Hospital stay Day Zero

656
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
In the maternity ward

657
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
Can butterflies on the walls and images of roses opening

658
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Adam

659
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:52,192
Everyone's really good looking like in an ER sort away or are they going to Grey's Anatomy kind of way we had

660
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,752
Like one superhot we call her cupcake

661
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
And she had this like glossy hair and you know people would visit me and they be like hey is cupcake here

662
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
What is cupcake coming by

663
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,784
And so that's where their Hospital Journey began the 5 days later

664
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
Everything Has Changed they find themselves on a different

665
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Florida Hospital

666
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
Stranded in this unit

667
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,584
It is perhaps more than any other place on Earth the physical embodiment of this limbo the neonatal intensive

668
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Square unit the NICU

669
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Where they just have to wait

670
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,752
And hope that that will or whatever it was they saw on Juniper

671
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
Takes hold

672
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
We have been like

673
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
Yanked out of our lives

674
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
And out of everything that we recognized

675
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
LIRR jobs at her house

676
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
And we just been

677
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Got to do this

678
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,768
Science fiction

679
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
Nothing was recognizable

680
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,656
Babysitting look like babies you know

681
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,240
There's one baby that had his intestines being outside of his body

682
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
Piled up on his belly like in this bag

683
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,712
Everyone's wearing uniform don't know who anyone is

684
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,808
And everything's like be big humming and

685
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
I don't know how you're going to be there and you don't have any sense of time

686
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Like day and night don't mean anything

687
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,608
Yeah we're sort of dimly aware of the Sun

688
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,936
Rising and setting out the window

689
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
Other than that

690
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
It's just

691
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Just like

692
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
Minute to minute hour to hour

693
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
You're afraid to leave even for

694
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
You for an hour to get some lunch because the baby could die

695
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
You know if we went home to get some sleep when she

696
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
Wichita is that critical and

697
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
She had roughly

698
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
Five six days that went pretty well

699
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
And then that next weekend

700
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:02,496
Blue horn Destin's beginning of a lot of problems

701
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
And her belly turned dark and got real distended inserting drains in the belly

702
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
To try to drain away stool and donk

703
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
And she just had this little straw sticking out of her belly and then they couldn't maintain your blood pressure

704
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
So I was thinking of everything I could do cuz you don't want to feel powerless in a situation like that you want to feel like there's something Uke

705
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Can do

706
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
So in Quiet Moments what time we do chapter 1

707
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
The boy who left

708
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776
Is he would stand over Juniper's incubator

709
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,896
And you would read her Harry Potter mr. and mrs. dursley of number four privet Drive

710
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,456
We're proud to say that they were perfectly normal

711
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,528
Thank you very much they were the last people you'd expect

712
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
To be involved in anything strange or mysterious

713
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
As I start reading to her

714
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,416
And as the days went on

715
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,768
She has no idea what I'm reading right but there is something there that

716
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:03,424
She responded to I want to say she like because her her sat number would go High. Point

717
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
Pursat number what is it like for oxygen saturation of oxygen are blood

718
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,896
Temp says that number on the monitor was one of the only ways they can get feedback but how she's doing

719
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,736
Because your eyes are still closed there be times when she wasn't moving around alot

720
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
The higher the number the better

721
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
He says when he would read to her

722
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,440
Remembers would go up not just slowly but in stomach

723
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
But then

724
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
When I got deeper into the story

725
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,656
I read in Hagrid's voice biotic Professor Dumbledore sir

726
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
Set the Giant

727
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
Climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke

728
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
And

729
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
She decided instantly

730
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,968
It is larger just going off and going off a cliff and Kelly hit me and she said you're scaring the baby

731
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
And I'm like what what

732
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
You could see

733
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Even before Horizon

734
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
But she was really responding to what we were doing

735
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,280
She didn't know what chapter is but she was in her own way

736
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
Very eagerly waiting for the next job

737
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
And I don't know a better way to describe one to be a lie

738
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
Then you want to find out what happens next

739
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,896
Unfortunately what happens next is that one night around 2 in the morning

740
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
A rear night that they actually went to sleep at home

741
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
They got a call from their doctor

742
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
His first question was how far do you live from the hospital

743
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
Daniel that's not a question you want to hear from your child

744
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
We'd like Rush Hospital

745
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,584
When they get there they were told that she did again she got another hole

746
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:43,520
Another holder Destin's and she started to really spiral

747
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
I really go downhill her blood pressure and oxygen levels were crashing she was on 100%

748
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:56,320
Oxygen the ventilator settings are turnips high as they can go and she was still struggling and faltering and you know once they are giving her baby

749
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
100% oxygen they can't give her anymore at that point that done everything that I could possibly two

750
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:09,120
This is Bowser Shaquille Hospital

751
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:15,520
Everything she could think of blood pressure medicine antibiotics she put a drain in her abdomen that obviously was not enough

752
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,336
What's wrong baby wrong we might lose her.

753
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,712
The only option left to take her to the operating room with car open clear the intestines

754
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Relieve the pressure

755
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
How do you do a surgery on a 1-pound baby it seems exactly

756
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,672
I mean you don't either so extremely premature

757
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
So fragile

758
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
So tiny that operating

759
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
Same kind of crazy

760
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,632
Dr. Shakil began to really consider the idea that

761
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
Maybe this was it

762
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Headed that point

763
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
I was in bed side

764
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
Looking at her

765
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Trying to figure out what to do

766
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
And

767
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
All of a sudden

768
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Cuban rice

769
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,111
Really yeah she opened her eyes

770
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,439
Why didn't she looked at us

771
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,095
Rise were like wide open and she was looking right at the doctor directly

772
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Exterior hard

773
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,215
And it was very proud of the moment

774
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,383
Dr. shakeel says she decided right then and there

775
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Surgery

776
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
I think she deserves a chance

777
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,599
Tell me more about why you made a decision typically babies who are that

778
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Critical

779
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:40,255
Identity and responsive because they're just fighting for every breath and Divinity 2

780
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Just

781
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
Open her eyes at that stage in our life when she had no blood pressure that I could barely record when she

782
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
He had hardly any Oxygen

783
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,519
For her to just open your eyes and look at us

784
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,591
Was a very powerful statement that I'm still here

785
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
I'm here

786
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
I am still here don't give up

787
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
Dr Shakil summon the Pediatric surgeon told her

788
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,063
They want to move forward with the operation

789
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
Surgeon said no

790
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
The surgeon was adamant that she did not want to do it he said it's it's if it's futile and it's

791
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,679
Is she her blood pressure is so unstable that she would not make it out of the or

792
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
Insurgent Elder even if I can open her up and do the job your skin is so papery that I might not be able to

793
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,151
So we're back up there are guidelines that

794
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
Medical Industries have you been

795
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:36,575
Basic things like the Hippocratic oath to do no harm that's law professor an ethicist Nita farahany again

796
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Many Physicians

797
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:43,231
Legitimately believe that if you have a preterm infants and that infant is

798
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,815
In serious Peril of spending a life of

799
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,911
Suffering and pain the only way to do know how I meant to feel your road

800
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
He's not to do the surgery

801
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:59,103
But she says if you ask the court show right now the law favors

802
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Life

803
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:06,271
The courts have seen very few cases that involve disputes like this but in everyone's so far she says

804
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,111
They've supported the person who's arguing to keep the Child Alive

805
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
It whenever there's life There's Hope

806
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
So

807
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
This is our windows we should do it now

808
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,327
Productor Shaquille the argument that ultimately won the day

809
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,935
Basically what I told her was that if you think she's going to die

810
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,239
Well she is dying right now

811
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
As we speak in the unit

812
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,895
So we can either do nothing and she definitely dies or we can do something and she probably dies but

813
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
You never know there is a slim chance

814
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
So there we landed incubator with the baby in it

815
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,903
And hold their little hand and she's getting ready to go into surgery and she was looking right at me

816
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
And

817
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
She hadn't done that before

818
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,791
It really seemed like she was aware that I was there

819
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
Very clearly and she was a lock on my face

820
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
So I can lie down try to give her a little kiss on her forehead

821
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
Adopted the same thing and then they wheeled her way

822
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
How long is the operation

823
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
It was

824
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:12,831
We think they call a page does much more quickly than we expected to come back so we knew

825
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Something was wrong

826
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,975
The nurse assured Tom and Kelly into a separate room this little windowless

827
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Conference room

828
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
And the surgeon came in and

829
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
She said you know I

830
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
She's supposed to go in and

831
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,983
Clean everything out and runs everything off and find the hole and Patch it in and do all these things

832
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,055
And she said when she cut the baby open

833
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,663
And touched the baby's intestines with her little probe

834
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,223
She's the way she described it was everything fell apart

835
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
It was just falling apart falling apart

836
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
And you're hearing this

837
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Yeah

838
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
Jennifer had survived the operation

839
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
But barely

840
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,047
So we're thinking like okay this was an incredibly risky surgery

841
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
And we just threw it for nothing

842
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
Anna

843
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,239
Either I thought there was no way that they was going to live till morning

844
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
I've been really working hard to avoid

845
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Thinking about all the bad things that were

846
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
That's waiting to happen here

847
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,991
Just trying to hold on you know and let certified with my job to do that

848
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
And dumb

849
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,719
Stereotypical email with me and

850
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
And Tom says they were in the car

851
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
Around the time of the surgery

852
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
We're driving

853
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
Bedtime

854
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
June bug and I were

855
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
About two-thirds of the way to the first book

856
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,799
And the thought just snuck in on me which was

857
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
What if I don't

858
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Get to finish reading her

859
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Facebook

860
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
What if she doesn't get here then

861
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,391
She never finds out you know

862
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
What happens to Harry

863
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Hermione and Ron

864
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
That thought

865
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
Letting the other

866
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,007
Very difficult thoughts about all the things we wouldn't get to do it

867
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
She would never get to know

868
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,991
And I had this terrible thought that you know she was in this incubator the sisal add plastic box and I

869
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
Had this terrible thought that she was just going to go from one box to another

870
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
I had to pull over

871
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,999
I just lost it and

872
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,423
At that point I wasn't maintaining there was no holding back this flood of

873
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,079
We had a rule Kelly languages that only one of us got to lose it at a time

874
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
That was my turn to loosen

875
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,015
We're in a very unnatural situation of neonatal intensive care which is so

876
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:54,367
Recent in the developed world and still doesn't exist too much of the world

877
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
And

878
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,975
Working so hard to save babies is very new

879
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
Neonatologists

880
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,119
Keith Arrington and evolutionary history newborn babies very frequently died

881
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,471
And most parents who have any significant number of children

882
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,031
Head West one or two or three or more

883
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:18,175
And in order to be able to carry on with your life and to provide for the rest of your family

884
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,575
We have to be able to adapt to the death of a Pious and now that has become much less common to lose a baby

885
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,183
Miscarriages and stillbirths so now we realizing

886
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,535
How much that hurts in the past maybe we've hit and some of them for myself

887
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
No way the day was Callisto morning

888
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
But what happened was

889
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,751
Really strange

890
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
She continued to just

891
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Not die

892
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,759
And the next day she

893
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,087
You know she was still there

894
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
The surgeon was surprised and

895
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,047
No one could quite explain it the more I thought about it the more I found it

896
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
I like surprising an interesting

897
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
You know because she doesn't know

898
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,983
If there's a better place

899
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
You know but she's just in this box

900
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
And she's got needles coming out of

901
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
Every Witch Way and

902
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Tube down her throat

903
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,991
She has no idea that

904
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
One day you know she'll just be

905
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Held

906
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Rockton

907
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
I'll take her out for ice cream and

908
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
So play with the dog

909
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,327
And I just wonder like what is she fighting for

910
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
So that became you know our job

911
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
The best that we can articulate it was to try to give her some sense of something Beyond

912
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
On that place after the surgery things did not get

913
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,279
She would stop breathing many times a day

914
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
Teams with Russian to come back come back

915
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
I just remember the room spinning and then she started to swell her like weeks and weeks

916
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:23,359
But you continue to not die but you began to gain weight

917
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,943
And you know nurses are very superstitious lot of them

918
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:33,599
They won't say the word home for some reason when the babies hear that word to Tracy Hall it again primary nurse

919
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
They get sick and we just

920
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
It's a Superstition obviously but

921
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,743
Something happens

922
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
And sometimes it can be

923
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Devastating

924
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
So what do you say instead

925
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,983
Riverside that place that the baby's going to go when they leave here

926
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,335
Sometimes we spell it which makes no sense at all

927
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
After about

928
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,639
4 and a half months

929
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
Diana nurse practitioner

930
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,247
Told us that we might want to think about buying a car seat

931
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
That was

932
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
First

933
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
Inclination

934
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,159
That we might

935
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,791
We'll take her out of there that's the first time I've ever imagined a choir of angels singing around mention of

936
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:20,191
Car seat car seats right but when you're at when you want to have a baby really bad everybody else has a baby but you and you can't have a baby

937
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:24,799
Baby things like shopping for car seats become like fantasies you know

938
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,871
And finally you know the doctor gave the

939
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
All clear and

940
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
We took the monitors off of her

941
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
And she was completely free

942
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,879
An untethered AutoAnything

943
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,487
Hawaii straps are in his car seat and I put a little pair of sunglasses on her

944
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
Cuz I didn't know of her

945
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
I should be okay in the sunlight

946
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
She never seen the Sun

947
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
I we all kind of

948
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
Walked out and

949
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Tracy's really not a hugger but

950
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
We like

951
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,639
Grabbed her and hugged her and cried and

952
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
Oliver hazard

953
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
Luke baby the Karan

954
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:09,087
It was Chick-fil-A

955
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,415
That was totally before the gay thing before I stopped going to Chick-fil-A

956
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
And all in all how long were you in the hospital for

957
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
6 and a half months

958
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
196 days

959
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
How is gyro pronounced

960
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
What it what is

961
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
Videos of snapshot of her morning

962
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
Sure actually time in California

963
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,991
Nice enough to allow it to send a reporter to their house

964
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,319
To meet her

965
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
She's 2 years old now

966
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
Good morning Jennifer

967
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,239
When we got there she was still she was

968
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,591
Doing better was just waking up

969
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,735
Snappy

970
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
But then she just sprung up jumped out of bed and took off

971
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,631
Daddy funny

972
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:38,175
Come on show me where Katie is

973
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:44,575
I know you want to give a kitty a hug Jeezy don't

974
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,903
Nice hug

975
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,463
She's kind of your typical two-year-old

976
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
Gentle and because we were there Juniper

977
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
Kind of important

978
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:04,543
See some chicks she's learned

979
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
Who sell results radio so they have no idea what you just did

980
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,047
You spend a lot of time chronicling

981
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,887
Sometimes very terrible things and

982
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
What's interesting is that

983
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,495
Yesterday morning

984
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Journalistic standards

985
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
You know we need to do is change a diaper

986
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
It was it was it was wouldn't even be on journalistic radar

987
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,367
But what you know as a parent

988
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:56,767
Especially after you've been through what we went through was

989
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:03,167
Everything and nothing you can do about it

990
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
Everything happened yesterday and now it's not a couple hours the entire world was contain

991
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:15,967
Inside of her

992
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,343
All the blank chapters of her life were inside that morning

993
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
Which what you want this book

994
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
End

995
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,583
Do you feel like you're out of the woods

996
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,143
Well

997
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
Both Tom and Kelly said

998
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
No way

999
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
And then Thom Tillis about these flu shots

1000
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Jennifer gadd

1001
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,103
They're not just flu shots they're like gum

1002
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Flu shots

1003
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Like super flu shots and they

1004
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
The sports shots you yet

1005
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,039
And I swear to God they cost $14,000 for this Porsche

1006
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
And

1007
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,135
That is that the real number if you just said that's a fact

1008
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,231
They are designed to help protect her from

1009
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
RSV

1010
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,607
Which is a virus that in most people just presentas a common cold

1011
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:08,447
But I'm sure her lungs are still recovering and are still developing end

1012
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,495
RSV can be devastating

1013
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
And there's some other concerns it

1014
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,591
Concealed Creepin down the road

1015
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,919
Some Studies have shown that the kids were born prematurely

1016
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
Struggle more in school with reading and math

1017
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
That's

1018
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,807
Often they're more susceptible to

1019
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,391
Depression and anxiety but I will say that

1020
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,231
We took her to visit a preschool the other day

1021
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,839
We took her there and set her down and she just took off and like

1022
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
Went up to the

1023
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Giant children

1024
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,007
And started taking their toys and

1025
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,847
They were singing The Wheels On The Bus you could see it in her eyes I know that song

1026
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,943
And she didn't care about Tom Rye one bit

1027
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,783
You know she was totally there with those kids and she was

1028
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
So ready

1029
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
And I thought

1030
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Wow

1031
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,927
She might be okay

1032
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
She is okay

1033
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,031
And now for an update

1034
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,895
Originally aired this story in 2013 when Juniper was to

1035
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
You stay from just a few months ago

1036
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
How old are you

1037
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
40 my gosh

1038
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,111
You're about to turn 5 in April

1039
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,439
What's going to happen when you turn 5

1040
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Canopy

1041
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,327
When I don't either going to be this time

1042
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,679
Juniper is about to start kindergarten and

1043
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,239
Her and Tom and Kelly live

1044
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
In Indiana knauertown Kelly teach journalism at the Indiana University Media School actually happen to be in Indy

1045
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Just yesterday so I hooked up with Tom and Kelly we stood on the side of a busy Street in downtown Bloomington

1046
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,951
And they gave me an update they told me that in the nearly three years since we are this story this is generally not what you would expect

1047
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
Text my baby born that early

1048
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Physically

1049
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,863
We have had

1050
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:19,775
Shockingly few problems like she she hasn't had any I got a knock on some wood somewhere

1051
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:26,175
A horrible bout of the flu or it was never back in the hospital

1052
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
These are a little bit small and they're watching that but there's a staff

1053
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,975
Savagery to her true that is amazing so extremely

1054
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Headstrong

1055
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,839
Active Child really in the climbing trees

1056
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
How do you get up there

1057
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,447
Declined

1058
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,007
But you're so high up

1059
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,407
Ghost horseback riding she does gymnastics have some awareness of The Incredible Journey

1060
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
She went through just to be for 1/2 you guys talk about it later we talk about it because every night

1061
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,623
She asked

1062
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:11,487
Tell me the story about when I was a little tiny baby in the hospital

1063
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
But is it

1064
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,095
Tell me about when I was sick tell me about what I had to hold in my tummy

1065
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
So

1066
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,983
You know for a long time I would just tell her the story when you're born you're born

1067
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
Very early

1068
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,591
A lot more early than you were supposed to be born

1069
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
Super extra small

1070
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
I called

1071
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
The hospital

1072
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:38,623
Over the summer and I said hey like every night we're talking about this can I show her the NICU like would you let me

1073
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:45,023
Just show her the space and what an incubator looks like and they were amazing about it and so

1074
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:50,911
Have an incubator in an empty room and they let her come in and just play in the room and

1075
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,983
Took her little doll baby that I

1076
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,383
Ordered for her on preemie doll baby, whatever that's like this size and weight that she was when she was a baby

1077
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,223
Is that a real thing

1078
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,807
So she could get an idea of how small she was I don't know if that'll be useful someday

1079
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,463
So she took it to the NICU and she put it in the incubator and we showed her how we would reach our hands through the little

1080
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
Portholes

1081
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
And hold her hand and she reached in and held her little babies little cloth and then because she's due to veranda

1082
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:26,751
Where she would do this she climbed into the freaking incubator and laid down

1083
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,335
And ask Tracy the nurse to close the lid

1084
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,127
Yeah

1085
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:39,295
Like she was I like that like that like that like

1086
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:45,695
And she said at one point during the visit this woman walked by the room

1087
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
She had that look about her like

1088
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,327
She's a couple days

1089
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,351
Postpartum

1090
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
I thought oh God you know

1091
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,007
Tracy kind of whisper in her ear Tracy the nurse and

1092
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
She looked at dinner and she said

1093
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,127
Oh my God she's so beautiful

1094
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:10,527
And then she told us that she just had a baby a few days before that was born at 20

1095
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
3 weeks and 6 days

1096
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,695
Hippity hop hippity hop

1097
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,535
Hey baby hey hippity hop

1098
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:30,239
Nap speaking of that specific chocolate I'm 23 weeks 6 days we ended up checking back in with Annie different

1099
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,639
Funny professor of lawn phosphate Duke University about that whole viability question like that line of wind

1100
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:43,039
Preterm infant comes viable which at the time we did the stories seem to be roughly around 24 weeks

1101
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
Peaks on average has that changed at all

1102
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,695
It's pointless to study that was in a 2015 we should serve a big survey

1103
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Of outcomes

1104
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,791
For preterm infants and it basically argued that

1105
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:59,935
We might want to push that line back even further study author believes the 22 weeks is the new standard for viability

1106
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:05,055
Reborns that's 23 weeks and my 3 weeks and 6 days if that's too late

1107
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,615
She says this is now the new conversation

1108
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,895
22 weeks

1109
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,223
24 you know this is something that's

1110
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,343
Physicians and hospitals are being educated about and look at where he at 22 weeks

1111
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:23,743
You know in and it has been what two years since we last talked about this three years at most

1112
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,583
I mean so in three years if we've moved back two weeks

1113
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,983
Then talk to me in another quarter of a century and will be at the beginning

1114
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
I think it's just a matter of time before we get to that artificial womb a case blessing I'll say by way of updates is it

1115
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407

Normally I'm not one to gossip but this book is something else like

1118
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,391
We got into the story because of some

1119
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,207
Wheely hunting articles that Kelly has written

1120
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,607
For the Tampa Bay Times in this book takes his article so much for either goes into way more detail than we could ever get into

1121
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
It is

1122
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,935
