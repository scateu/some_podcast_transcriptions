1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Radiolab

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,896
From WNYC

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
And NPR

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,064
Hey I'm jad abumrad Radiolab

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
We're talking about

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,184
I don't think they'll ever be another space

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
Actually next podcast

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
Full hour about stories and grow out of particular thing

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
Projects for today we have a preview yes or no

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
So that's the place

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
This is the place the story about a thing

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Lives inside a Steel Vault

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Inside this huge Laboratory

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,968
At wits University in Johannesburg South Africa

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,368
Real estate Professor their doctor Bernards FL to pull it out and show it to a reporter

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Patricia Hume

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
And this is the original

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
This is it

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
We have a driver

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
In front of us here

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
I mean

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
I had to listen up when I get this fish every time I

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
Take this out

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
The reason it Gibson gooseflesh

27
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Goosebumps is because

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,152
This object seems to completely up and two basic questions about

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
You know human history

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Amazing

31
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
Where Do We Begin

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,880
And when we began who was trying to take us out

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Producer Andy Mills takes

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Break

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
With thunder and vigor and gust

36
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Yes I'd like to ask us

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
Alright it's one of those discoveries

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
That almost didn't happen

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
And here to help me tell you the story okay I'm Professor Lee Berger

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
Is late I am a research professor

41
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
At the University of witwatersrand in Johannesburg in an acre

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
Explorer in Residence at the National Geographic

43
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
And explorer-in-residence that's a weird title it seems like you didn't you should be one or the other

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Oxymoron is yeah we said that our Story begins back in the 1920s in South Africa at a place call

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Call Tong Tong

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
It's tea and Yugi is the proper lane in Suwanee

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
The Western way of saying his tongue

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
It's a a desert area on the

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,824
Southern edge of the Kalahari escarpment

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Typical picture of Africa

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Roxbury about trees running gazelles and

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Back in the 1920s

53
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
The place was crawling with Europeans

54
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Blasting away with with with dynamite

55
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Drilling with big steam girls and

56
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
Huge explosion would take place in one day these miners

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,328
They're blowing their way through bit of this Hillside and

58
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
As The Rock Falls away

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
And Smoke Clears they realize that they've opened up this

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Cate Blanchett cave

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
And inside of that cake

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
They found dozens of these

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Strange looking Rock

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Almost like animals

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
What are the miners

66
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
He takes those bones given to a geologist geologist

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,136
Box them up and send them to this Australian guy who's living in Johannesburg

68
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Named

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Raymond.

70
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
And that's probably the first miracle in the story

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Raymond Dart

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Was it neuroanatomy

73
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Comparative neuron

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,168
When the only ones in the world this was a guy who knew his fossils

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
When does box arrived who's actually wearing at 3

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
He's going to be best man at a wedding in fact later that afternoon but he's like

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
That can wait

78
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
He reached into the box

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
Shuffle through some Antelope skull was full of baboon skull monkey skulls

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Until he got to this one

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Note to your me

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
If this would have just looked like a big chunk of limestone

83
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
But Raymond are immediately realized

84
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
He had something special and he started

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
He actually went and got his wife knitting needles

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
And started

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
Scratching away at this rock much to his wife discussed

88
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
He then spent the next several months

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,616
Delicately chipping away at the Limestone until the rock literally

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Top free

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
And there he stared

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Into

93
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Perfect

94
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Little

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,160
Fix you can see here the face is quite flat and inhumanly

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
What was the face of a child a human child humans have a larger brain

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,703
According to doctors that felt this child's brain was smaller than a human child

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
It was closer to the size of a chimpanzee

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
So it had features of the human it had a brain more like a chimpanzees

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Stranger still

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,759
Start to remember study the sort of thing he looked at the foramen magnum

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,647
Hole in the base of your skull for your spine goes in for creatures that walk on four legs

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
That hole is generally towards

104
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
The back of the skull

105
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
So they can look forward but here

106
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
The holes on the bottom

107
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Which suggested to him that

108
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
This creature

109
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Walked upright

110
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
It was not a monkey

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
Wasn't an app as we know it

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
Today it was certainly not a modern human being this was something in between

113
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
If you were walking across a broken Woodland

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Queer little conch shell might have lived

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
You would have seen

116
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Person off in the distance

117
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
As you approach though you begin to see that something was wrong with the proportion arms are probably in the long

118
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
Longer legs a little bit shorter

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
And as you step closer you see the little phone shows body would have been covered in this thick hair

120
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
More like an ape then then we have but it'd be like Noah ever seen because it would be standing there

121
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
In very much the way you would be standing staring at

122
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Onto

123
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
So if it is a little bit human a little bit

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Kind of in the middle it seems that he did he feel like this was

125
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
The quote Missing Link

126
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
We don't use that term because Evolution doesn't happen that way there's certainly dark today

127
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
He even back wrote a book called adventures with the missing

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
And right after he discovered the skull he sent

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
The paper off at amazing speed to journal Nature

130
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Published in February

131
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
1925 e. This was going to revolutionize ever

132
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
But he was wholeheartedly

133
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Rejected

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
By the great scientific community

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Of your

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Batiri

137
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
First we already knew that humans didn't evolve in half

138
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Yeah Africa was backwards

139
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
That was the belief

140
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Says Chris Stringer on a research leader in human Origins at the Natural History Museum in London

141
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,751
Back in the early 20th century people of the time felt that if you can you can see

142
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Who is wonderful kyva painted many thousands of years ago they prefer to think that you are or Asia one more

143
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Would like to send to Savannah Origins

144
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Inextricable

145
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Second

146
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,855
Scientist already found a skull that they believe belong to the quote-unquote

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Missing Link

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
What's something cool piltdown man

149
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
It was this

150
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Ancient

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Man

152
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
Fossil thing that they found in a golf

153
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
Course in England so in their mind that was the right place

154
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,703
And also improved them then you've got this very large Brain and a brain case that looks

155
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Really quite like a more than human one

156
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Which made sense to them

157
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
You know clearly European ancestors

158
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Would have had big brain

159
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Because they're European

160
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,295
I'm in the Tomb individual at a smooth brain

161
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
Primitive look right

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
So dark

163
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
He spent

164
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
The next

165
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
20

166
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Plus years

167
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Arguing with people

168
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
This is our ancestor

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
And getting nowhere

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Until

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
In the late 1920s other fossil started showing up and showing up South Africa Kenya Ethiopia

172
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
Fossils they were from roughly the same era as the filter

173
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,663
Their brains are teeth or bone structures they were all totally different

174
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
So this was very weird I mean

175
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
How do you explain that for decades

176
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Nothing else not till that man turns out from anywhere in the world

177
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
Soaps in forensic experts at the London Museum of Natural History they decide

178
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,327
I started looking material under microscopes right off the bat

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
They found it

180
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
One of the teeth clearly showed

181
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
The marks of a metal Fallout

182
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
The deed has been filed down to look flat

183
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
No it down was a fraud

184
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
The fake forgery hoax in the hucksters were never caught they will questions in the house is a pond

185
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
About the competence of the Natural History Museum that it deletes expert shipping food through this time

186
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
This wasn't even a very good fake like for Tricare

187
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,911
The Jawbone of an orangutan they took some Motrin human skull pieces they then stain

188
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Bat material

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,799
Doc Brown so eat the same, like stone tools

190
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
And all this time

191
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Right there in front of them

192
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Was the poncho

193
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,087
It is estimated Inspirion estimate of being around 2 million 2.2 million years old

194
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Which still today is the oldest

195
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Not

196
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Quite yet human fossil that we have

197
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
This this would be

198
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Probably

199
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
The greatest

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
One of the greatest

201
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,935
Ever been argued to be the most important

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,055
Single fossil ever discovered in the history of humankind surgery

203
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
It brought to the full

204
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
That Humanity originate

205
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
In Africa

206
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
But every human on earth

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Is an African

208
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Will of African origin

209
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Butts butts

210
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
More than just

211
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Where

212
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
We came from which I think it's totally cool

213
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,303
Super interesting weekend we can look at the skull and we can see things

214
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
About

215
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
You know what life was like

216
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
For this

217
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Like little version of us

218
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
That lived so long ago you were looking

219
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
The teeth

220
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
It was eating

221
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
Was it eating like what we eat surprisingly similar

222
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Tortoise

223
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
So yeah it wasn't it wasn't like

224
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Hugely differ

225
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
From what we eat

226
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
But I think

227
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
The most exciting thing

228
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Vatican telescope

229
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
You know not just about what our life

230
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Was like

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
But

232
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
What was

233
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Lurking in the shadows

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Waiting

235
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
To take us out

236
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
You can tell that from this

237
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Diamond Vista school is it

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Kind of at the center of this murder

239
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Who killed the tongue shop

240
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
At the time when when when Raymond dark

241
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Made that Discovery he had this sort of

242
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Gut feeling that this Taung Child was killed by one of its own

243
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,599
You know cuz this is like 19-24 we were between two Wars War

244
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
One hitter

245
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,999
Record the horrible destruction that was actually a medic in that war and he walked away convinced

246
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Humans were were inherently

247
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
Evil creatures that were inherently violent and that we are probably a lot worse in the past

248
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,031
In fact the opening of 2001 A Space Odyssey

249
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,383
Where you see the monkeys

250
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
Beating each other with the bones was based on Raymond darts theories of the violet

251
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Origin

252
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
On the continent of Africa

253
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
So that was darts like pets

254
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
Siri that maybe tongaat Club down by his brother or his name

255
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
But

256
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
That ignores one big

257
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,679
In that Limestone mine where the tongs go was found there were also all these others

258
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,775
Boone schools monkey skulls and roses like little collection of Bones

259
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
More like what you would expect

260
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Defined in a predator set

261
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Donut

262
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Datong

263
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
Like creature but maybe

264
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Cat

265
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Big cat

266
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
At least a large mammalian Predator then because that's perfectly acceptable

267
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
We're tough

268
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
They're tough

269
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
It's okay to be killed by something mean and vicious

270
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
That became the new Theory

271
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Because

272
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
What else do humans have to fear

273
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,935
Write what now here's where I think maybe you come into the story for some reason when you arrive

274
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Many many many years later

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
This idea

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
The cat did it

277
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Seems to disturb

278
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
I was addicted to that story is anyone else I've been brought up on it through my anthropology classes every every

279
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Book I ever read said that

280
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
But

281
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
One day in in 1990

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,743
For he bumps into a completely new idea Eureka moment

283
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Is there I was

284
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
At Gladys field

285
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
An excavation site in South Africa Lee and his team we're doing what they do digging for fossils I just finish Excavating

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Haitian Almighty mid left and I was sitting there watching the Sun

287
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
And I looked up on the hillside

288
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
There was a troop of vervet monkeys are small gray monkey

289
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Never coming down to Ford's down the hill

290
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
It also sent her an alarm call

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
I looked up in the sky

292
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
And there came

293
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Huge eagle

294
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
The Monkees

295
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
Scatter is Eagle swooped around the edge of

296
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
And as it came down around the edge of the hill I realized you

297
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
The Trap

298
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Because coming around the other agent Hill

299
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
Was that Eagles make

300
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Edit

301
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Zoomed in

302
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
And whack one of those large monkeys

303
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Right in front

304
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
And everything went silent

305
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,295
The other Eagle landed this Eagle sitting on top of a now-dead monkey

306
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Eagle staring at me

307
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
I'm stranded it probably would

308
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
My mouth open looks at me for a moment

309
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
And then leaps off the edge of this cliff

310
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Cliff with the dead monkey

311
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
And flies away with

312
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Is it down

313
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
And I had no idea

314
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
So I got into my car

315
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,055
I chase the direction it went I knew it was going I knew but he's Black Eagle Nest where they were up on a cliff face

316
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
I crawled up under crossing the river crawled up under the

317
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
The nest and there was

318
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Pilot

319
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Shoot

320
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Hyraxes little antelope

321
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Baboon skull

322
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Baby baboon skull

323
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Almost every one of the bones there

324
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
These amazing

325
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Markson

326
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,327
Keyhole shaped Cuts where the Eagles have

327
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Driven their talents into the skull

328
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
These big eagles can have

329
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,519
Killing talented 5 6 7 in long if you can imagine that

330
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
I got in my car back to the lab in joburg

331
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
He wakes up in the drawer that contains those

332
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Skulls and bones that were found

333
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
With the taung child skull

334
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
And

335
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Zach

336
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
C Mart

337
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Kimberly

338
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
There's even like

339
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
A little Mark on the tongue child skull itself

340
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,863
A year later 1995 he and a colleague they publish a paper

341
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Burdett blamed Eagles

342
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
The death of The Gong Show

343
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
And it was received

344
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Like

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Smelly wet blanket

346
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,407
Why why why why would they not say oh of course

347
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Because

348
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
It was entrenched ID

349
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,807
Lee says maybe subconsciously

350
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
They felt they

351
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,159
Like our ancestors are being demoted again that is the

352
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
You know we were not the masters of our universe

353
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Because

354
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Cats just

355
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Steel tougher than Birds

356
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,423
I don't know but according to leave the big cat scientist were let you know it's been published it's been published delivered

357
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
For 40 years Sweden gun

358
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,775
Into a debate in the in the

359
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Colored pages of

360
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
The journal Nature

361
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
Under load lifting capacity of birds of prey on whether or not birds-of-prey could lift something Islam

362
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Large is the taung child

363
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
And these debate

364
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
They went on for

365
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Ears

366
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
He couldn't convince people

367
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,231
We need something more until one night about 9 at night

368
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Years later his home scene in my little study

369
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:35,935
He was reading an academic paper about eagles and how eagles sometimes when they kill little mammals

370
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
They'll reach into their eye sockets

371
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
And pluck out their eyes to get it the nice juicy brain on the inside

372
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
And in the paper it was a really beautiful image

373
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
What's beautiful to me

374
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
People who study dead things

375
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
Beautiful image of skull of a primate

376
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
With the interior socket

377
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Eyes

378
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
With these Jagged marks

379
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
These very particular scratch marks

380
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
On the underside of the eye socket

381
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
And I was staring at these images and

382
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
I went

383
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,239
Oh my goodness or something to that effect I got in my car

384
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Drove down to the lab open up the safe

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Hold on

386
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Turn the face over

387
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
And there they were

388
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
On the base of the inside of the eye socket where these Jagged Richard Marx

389
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
That you had to have done

390
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
By reaching into the orb

391
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
The exact

392
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Same

393
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
Mark you can see little little exclamation mark

394
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Cummins

395
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
No one had noticed

396
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,543
In Imagine I'm sitting in the middle of this Anatomy Department in the middle of the night

397
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,895
In a vault containing million-year-old fossil a Magic Moment

398
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
It's so now you know

399
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
A little bit about how this creature lived and how it died

400
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
I mean Beyond solving the murder mystery what does that tell you

401
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,439
First to say solving the murder mysteries kind of cool

402
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,535
There's nothing wrong with just doing that

403
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Have you ever thought

404
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
Why when you're standing out on a

405
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Playground

406
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Or standing out in open field

407
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
And a shadow passes over you

408
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
Do you know that feeling that occurred whether it be from an airplane or whatever

409
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
First you get that tingly feeling on the back of your neck and then you

410
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
Yank your head up you ever wondered why you do that

411
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
You do that

412
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
Because the little Tong child died two and a half million years ago

413
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Because he didn't look up quick enough

414
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Producer animals

415
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
What did you say

416
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,079
One very important thing to say is actually didn't experiment with the story we hooked up with some people at MakerBot

417
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
It's a very nice folks

418
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
The field museum in Chicago

419
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,039
And we had 3D scans made of the taung child skull next to holding on right now

420
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
Mine's purple Instinct replicas of the

421
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Taung child skull menu

422
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,839
The Ridges you can feel the scratches in the eyes if you could listen to the store YouTube

423
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,191
While holding the tongue child in your hair well that's exactly the reason we did this

424
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
We have partnered with a museum

425
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
World Museum

426
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,919
That's spelled with forums two in the front two in the back Museum

427
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
It's this tiny little Elevator Shaft size place

428
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,343
Here in Manhattan where they display all these sort of like Oddities you know like little

429
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Objects from Saddam Hussein's Palace

430
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
I have a

431
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
Cool toys that were banned from Saudi Arabia right

432
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
And they will also be displaying error

433
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
3d replica of the taung skull

434
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
So if you go there

435
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
Can I see hold the skull you dial in a little number and you can hear part of the Peace

436
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
Is to listen to the story while holding this

437
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
Not only that if you have a 3D printer of your own

438
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
And you go to radiolab.org you can download a scanner 3D scan of the tongue skull

439
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
You can put your own

440
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
Thanks again to MakerBot and to shoot digital for helping

441
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
How to make that happen

442
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
Preston Levy for conceiving of the whole idea go to our website radiolab.org I'm Jedi boom wrought iron

443
