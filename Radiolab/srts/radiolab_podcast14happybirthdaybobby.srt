1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,800
Radiolab

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,664
From WNYC

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,736
And NPR

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,512
So a couple days ago we did this thing we got Robert into the studio but I notice

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
Sabrina's headphones

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,584
And we ambushed him

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
The whole staff rushed in singing cake the whole deal

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
Robert famously hates his birthday

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
Such a long time trying to hide my birthday is there anybody in there

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,344
Good Fortune to work with this man for over 10 years so

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
If you'll excuse us just this once we want to take this podcast to celebrate

14
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Mr. Robert krulwich

15
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,048
The Robert we didn't just for you in here for

16
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
Que Canta listen to thing to rectum

17
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
But we would love to

18
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
To share some of your earlier work as the next podcast

19
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
That's our executive producer Eleanor and she dug up a bunch of his old work in the archives and he eventually agreed to let us play some and three

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,040
Really interesting to hear the stuff because

21
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm not sure a lot of people who listen to Radiolab really get how much Robert sensibility drives the show

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Like his combination of theater and

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
Play in his desire to sound different than other stuff on the radio and took Northern rules

24
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,192
In all ways always in service of a genuine attempt to understand

25
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
Explain something

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,824
It also just amazing how many creative lives he lived before he came to Radiolab

27
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
I like here's one here's a piece from 1979

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Which is just a few years after NPR began

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Thanks these days you've noticed they're trying out new systems more and more we're being asked to deal with machine

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Instead of tellers

31
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
And that's the way the banks wanted according to our business correspondence

32
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Robert krulwich

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
Right here in Washington a few doors away from National Public Radio there's a chance at a color television

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Sunset and they have a treasure chest

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,312
With 10 Susan B Anthony Dollars inside which could be yours if you are willing to stand

36
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,640
Do a 3-minute demonstration of their new automatic teller assist

37
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't know. I went to powerful

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:37,696
In the pieces actually about how banks are starting these crazy things called ATMs

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,096
People are a little freaked out these machines eating my card from time to time

40
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,520
In a one-point Robert in order to explain why the bank

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Swirl lobbying so hard for these ATMs

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
He almost burst into song

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,992
Okay you send the check to Sears Sears deposit the check in the bank

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,600
Regional Bank from there it goes to your Regional Bank in your very own area

45
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
Meet me in the back to your hometown Banks meals and back to you

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
In a statement to get at the end of the month to check shows up in the packet hopefully now remember you listen to the whole thing through that is for

47
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,704
Different meanings for just one chat with all that post it and I wouldn't it be cheaper the banks are you

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
Stop mailing the check from place to place place

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
And tried another system

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
That system is called electronic

51
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Fun transfer in already

52
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
To cut down on Postage and handling

53
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Painful for me use another one we listen to it's also from 1979

54
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Soon as they report about

55
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
A report in quotes about interest rates

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,608
There is intense pressure from two different groups for changes in interest rates

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
One group was from down the other group wants them up even higher both sides are

58
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
Powerful and important to our economy

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592
And the ins-and-outs of their struggles are worthy of an opera

60
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
In fact they are an opera

61
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
I know from the Palazzo Verde

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,856
We present this live performance of Alfredo Tucci's Immortal Opera

63
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Erato interesting

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
And here is our host

65
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Sewer Joplin

66
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Thank you very much

67
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
There aren't very many offers the deal exclusively with the subject of interest rates for this one I think is the most magma

68
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Any person to vote

69
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Tucci related with toad in a single afternoon after a traumatic event according to his biography of Standish Library

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Scarred him for life

71
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,527
Beaches that stood she was walking along the road in the city when passing by in the tram he saw the exquisite

72
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Beautiful Sylvia fine

73
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Dashie ribeye can you what

74
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Do you want to test

75
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
To meet at

76
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
Well then he was at pool composer he decided

77
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
If you would send to the gift

78
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
At what temperature

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
And he chose wall to wall carpet

80
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,447
In order to get the money for the carpet that we had to get the household finance loan

81
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
To his horror

82
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,615
He found out what the interest rates when I'm alone and it's writing is Aria a KK

83
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
Office tasks today personally follow these real life events

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
Lupines waiting the Italian section of Louisville Kentucky

85
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Where Angelina will she want to watch World Cup

86
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Names of the interest rate is

87
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
18 and a half percent

88
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
This scene begins as she gasped in astonishment and resolved not to buy the carpet normal

89
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
Gina tell this to the carpet seller perugino's

90
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,591
Gino is 52 stabbed in his usual value of the business management

91
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
Has Angelina then that she cannot afford.

92
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
Now that

93
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Codependency no he's not happy

94
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Here's the thing about this

95
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
A Paul volcker

96
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
At the time was the chairman of the Federal Reserve board

97
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,839
And what I do in act 3 is I take

98
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Paul

99
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
And I from a press conference that he

100
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Which I was at

101
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
And I cut him into

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
The

103
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Opera

104
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Ladies and gentlemen

105
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
We're face-to-face with economically

106
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Difficulties really unique

107
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
In our experience

108
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Interest rates is

109
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
It is just one of those walking on a razor edge right now

110
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
3doodler Alfredo to chase International

111
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,831
Vistakon

112
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,183
I can't believe that that was on national public radio that was a crazy day

113
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,071
We could we do things then like I interviewed an anchovy they are taller

114
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,911
So there is no what there's no Gatekeepers were like no

115
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,751
After the Opera we listen to something from 1992

116
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,335
We should be just after I graduated high school and hear Robert

117
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,687
Teams up with a couple of actors and comedians to do a story about a yearly recap thing

118
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
I'm Robert krulwich and welcome to the second annual edition of backfire this program has been a tradition on NPR since

119
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
1991

120
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
And this is the occasion when We Gather to review the events of the year in this case the year 1992 and once again we were able

121
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
Go to round up our regular Observers

122
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Buck Henry is a screenwriter and a pundit

123
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
You got the movie The Graduate by by Jane Curtin was an actress and a funded original cast Saturday Night Live Tony Hendra a pundit

124
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Famous satirist and a pundit

125
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
And all three of you now

126
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
A double punt a double ended in Tony's case

127
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
Let's have the first Quest

128
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Alberto which pundit

129
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
What was the real explanation

130
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
What President Bush's collapse

131
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,695
All the way back a year ago at the state dinner at Tokyo

132
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
You would call the event

133
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Buck

134
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,327
I do indeed he collapsed and more importantly he vomited

135
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
On the

136
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,935
He was at the prime minister of the foreign minister in the prime minister's lap

137
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
But push as you know is

138
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Name anyway

139
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
Bush is the

140
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Sound that you make

141
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Can you throw up so we could have simply been responding to someone saying by the way what is your name

142
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
And the sushi came with it

143
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
It is also

144
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
As I have read my history at Costco

145
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
A world leader

146
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
From time to time

147
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
To throw up

148
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
On the lap of the minister of a friendly governor

149
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
It demonstrates

150
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
Confidence in your host

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
A sense of the excellent

152
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Sunday dinner being served

153
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
And a

154
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Tradition of giving back something you've been given

155
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
Equipping the consummate politician of giving his fall

156
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
How do you account for the

157
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,599
Surprised expression and an end the lack of delight really on the face of the time in a few when receiving this

158
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Gift

159
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
From President Bush

160
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
I think it was because it was done

161
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
After the first course is supposed to have to be completing me like that

162
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
Piece of your host before ingest

163
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
By the way there is some misconception here which is

164
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
It was just that this was a single event it's actually

165
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
Habit of throwing up in

166
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
The nearest Rangers lapis

167
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
It's not just a question of how to say it's something that's a bush has done ever since he was a little boy

168
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Origin of his his nickname Poppy

169
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,023
Because he's not a Mumsy used to refer to as in better habitat

170
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,887
Up Trucking and septic pumping his original family has projectile puppy

171
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,567
What we would do this like for for 2 hours in manoli was alright

172
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
She would not even

173
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
Smile

174
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,015
Where we went like this was the least listen to program in all of NPR

175
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
Reduce dust from 12 Years to 2 years

176
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
21 only on New Year's Eve

177
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
At 10 p.m. you know what it's like

178
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
2B schedule

179
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
4:10 p.m. on New Year's Eve that means you have

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Failed

181
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Then

182
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
This is how life works

183
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Sitting in my house and the phone rings

184
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
That's the White House

185
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
And some guy says

186
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Do you is your group available

187
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Next

188
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
March 3rd

189
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Of the White House

190
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Trivia I said well

191
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
I don't think you

192
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,855
I said maybe you should just ask whoever's idea this was

193
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
To like that adore

194
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
Write about 2 weeks pass and then that he's about as good news and that is I listen to it

195
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
And yes

196
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
It isn't Fun

197
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
But

198
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
The people who think it's

199
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Honey is a person

200
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
And this president

201
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
So

202
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
That's the end so we went

203
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
We went to the east room

204
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
And

205
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
It was incredible

206
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
My wife was there

207
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
You look across that your wife

208
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
The White House

209
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
The president laughing

210
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Dumb joke

211
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
There's certain moments

212
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Will you feel

213
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Strangely black

214
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Like

215
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Either you were really great giraffe

216
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Previous

217
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
This life is a journey

218
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Reward or

219
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Every so often

220
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
God just leans down to the clouds

221
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Kisses you

222
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
This will be

223
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Just

224
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
A chance for you to be

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Enjoy

226
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
So that night I just

227
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
It was a big deal

228
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
There's a couple pieces that you've done

229
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Free radio

230
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Where

231
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Like as a as a young radio

232
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Reporter you know how you were in your nose face

233
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
We also are starting some

234
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Idea of what we should sound like

235
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
What we should do what

236
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
What's permissible

237
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
And then you hear this thing come out of the radio

238
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
And you're like

239
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
I didn't know you could do that

240
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
I just didn't know you that was allowed to play a one

241
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Piece of yours that had that effect on me

242
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
You did this in 1981

243
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
I heard it you know years later when it was featured on this website

244
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
But this is pre Radiolab so I heard that we had met yet

245
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
This is multiplayer

246
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
The story of the krasilovsky is one of the great commercial rivalries in New York history

247
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
Began when Sam razumovsky open a moving company years and years and years ago

248
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Wayback

249
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
I can understand him

250
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Well my time and I've been

251
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,831
Peterbrooke also runs the office at the krasilovsky trucking company in Brooklyn

252
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
I imagine there was a big family

253
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Brother's uncle's cousin

254
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
Very competitive competitive is putting it mildly

255
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,423
The Firm started in 1904 when Sam krasilovsky and his brother Dave grazulis

256
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Formed a Hauling Company

257
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
Call Sam krasilovsky and bro bro is for brother

258
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
And they would do move heavy things like church bells and statue

259
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
And help them they hired their nephew

260
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Microsoft

261
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
420 years everything was fine

262
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
Mike until Uncle Dave decided to bring his son's into

263
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
The business under the circumstances Mike

264
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Had to disassociate himself from the uncles

265
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Fence. On his own

266
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
That is Mike's brother who will serve as our narrator

267
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,703
It is the late 1930s there are now two krasilovsky moving companies Mike's and his uncles

268
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
To remind customers that he was now in business for himself Mike took out a series of display ads in the New York

269
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Phone book on very page

270
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Weather krasilovsky Czar list

271
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Me Ed's

272
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
Remember Mike there is only one cries a lot

273
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
In addition

274
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Remember Mike

275
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
On all the

276
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
The truck started in work

277
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,815
Too many customers could not remember which krasilovsky with which they just open the phone book and call any Chrysler

278
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
Husky and that is when Mike got this

279
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Incredible idea

280
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
He said

281
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
If you could move ahead of his uncles in the telephone book

282
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,639
People would see his name first and then they call him first instead of the other present

283
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
So he decided

284
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,551
Do I add a new listing in the telephone but he took out the v in krasilovsky

285
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
I'm put in a u that made it crash lowsky

286
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
KRA Silo you moved him one entry ahead of his uncle seems by the alphabet

287
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
You'll always be

288
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
CVS

289
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
But Mike Kozlowski

290
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
Is now called was not prepared for the perfidy

291
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Of his cousin Milton krasilovsky

292
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Milton Milton krasilovsky was another young son son of David krasilovsky in the early 90s

293
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
What is Milton

294
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Started a new trucking company called

295
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,807
Crescent house key with a you as was the case with Mike but to move ahead of Mikey changed his

296
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
First name

297
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
From Milton to

298
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
Mick Mick krasilovsky what are you hoping

299
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,631
That he would be ahead of Mike in the listings which of course she was

300
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,727
Bianco's meanwhile anxious to catch up join forces with Milton or Mick

301
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
I'm created the

302
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Krasilovsky

303
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Safe Company they dropped

304
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
Did the v in Kozlowski but in a no-sew the uncle's krasilovsky

305
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
Moved ahead of Mike's Crab House

306
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Ski bike

307
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
But it's quite upset as well he might have been

308
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
For Revenge

309
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
He countered with a great leap taking over the atlas safety company which moved him to the front of the telephone book

310
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
Leaving the case behind to be finer air of the AC

311
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
But one year later

312
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
The uncles were on the same page

313
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
The Acme

314
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
Safe Company was a division of

315
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Krasilovsky and brothers

316
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
According to Mike's brother by the mid-1950s even though Mike still had only one moving business in Brooklyn

317
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Metropolitan Avenue

318
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
Mike krasilovsky by this time had 18 listings under 18 different names in the telephone book of the uncles

319
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
1013

320
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Yes we have listings

321
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,999
Throughout the Yellow Pages and

322
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
White Pages

323
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
For one company

324
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,911
So that we could get all the listings ahead of the other relatives

325
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Did you do it

326
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
For fun or

327
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
No

328
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
This was not

329
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
The fun this was very serious they were

330
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Was no reason we felt

331
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
That another member of the family that has

332
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Has just walked in

333
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
Should capitalize on the name of krasilovsky

334
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
The final Salvo was fired by the uncle's actually was

335
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
Cousin on the uncle side named Marvin

336
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
He created

337
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,719
The AAA Acme krasilovsky safe

338
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
After that the public

339
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,887
Was so completely confused it according to Richard krasilovsky all the krasilovsky businesses

340
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Has began losing custom

341
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
It does affect the business

342
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Jose who

343
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
Who are you and who do you belong to

344
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Mike died in the

345
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
His wife sold the business

346
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Listen changed her name from

347
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Keselowski

348
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Keep the crass and then move to Florida

349
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,295
Mike's brother Monroe stayed in the business he now calls his friend whoever the

350
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Empire

351
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Safe Company he and his son Richard would like to use

352
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
It is after all their name

353
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
But they don't dare

354
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
Because there is now a whole new generation of krasilovsky is moving into the

355
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
The phone book the original

356
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Acme company

357
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Has now been

358
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Split

359
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
So they are all over the lot

360
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
There are now more Suns

361
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
And there are more names

362
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
Here with my colleague Margot Adler going to read you the latest set of list

363
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455

For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:20,191
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times

00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
So did something

385
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,615
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

386
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

387
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

388
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,975
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

389
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have

390
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215

Thank you so much

395
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
Jackie or so after Eleanor denying the whole staff Ambush Robert in the studio and play top stories towards the end of the whole thing

396
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
Robert went off on this insane digression

397
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
And it happens all the time in the studio like he'll go off on something and unfortunately cut it out cuz it's not part of the story we're telling but this

398
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Case we're going to put it in

399
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
None of his birthday and also cuz it just

400
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
It just illustrates

401
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
What an insanely curious duty is

402
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,647
Look at this incredible curiosity that makes him like

403
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Heat-seeking missile

404
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Or weirdo Adventures

405
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,863
And that is what is attracted me to him and the entire staff to him and probably a lot of people who listen to him

406
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,471
So here's a random digression of his it's him telling the story of his first

407
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263

Tune out secret zoo in basement of fancy suburb and suddenly there's now the sewing machine

And in this sewing store

485
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
They would bring

486
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448

All of the Alec

491
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
It sounded like

492
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
A jungle riot

493
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
From the basement so you're saying they were upstairs sewing and Below them these alligators were alligators

494
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744

00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,632
That it was a B-flat

499
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
So is his

500
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
Theory that it was a bee flap that cause
