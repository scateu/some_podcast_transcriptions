1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Ouat

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radiolab WNYC

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
Hate this is

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Pat Walters

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,672
Coming at you today with the final episode of R-rated mini-series on intelligence

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
G

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
Answer for this last

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
Episode we wanted to check the mood

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
Because everybody in the series together

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
We did

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
Lots of Stories on human

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Intelligence

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,520
But we also found ourselves thinking about intelligence in other end

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,848
Enter to get into that we decided to host an event

16
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
All about animals

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,456
And today we're going to share that event with you

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
Just a quick warning at there are

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Some curse words

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
I and Joe

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
So say that mine

22
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,440
And the reason that we're doing this is because a couple of months ago

23
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,792
I ended up on the phone with the science writer I really love named an amber

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
And then went on a rant

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
About how messed up is that

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,728
We only seem able to talk about animal intelligence in terms of our own until

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
He said

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
So much of animal intelligence research

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
I is built on making animals do stuff

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
That we feel like

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
Humans would be good at

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
Instead of considering their Intelligence on their own

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,392
And tonight we decided we're doing episode about animal intelligence

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
That shifts the focus from

35
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
From us

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
To them

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
That considers their unique abilities

38
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
On their own terms

39
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
I enjoy doing so

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
I hopefully might help us redefine a little bit what we think about

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Intelligence

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
A general for Olive

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
And because we're humans and

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
We like

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Contest we decide to make a competition

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Here's how to work

47
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
We have four contestants

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
Who engages series of head-to-head bounce

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
To convince a panel of judges

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
That their animal is the

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
I'm going to bring up our first pair of contestants in a moment

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
But I

53
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
First

54
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Let's meet our judges

55
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Oh well music

00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
I pound

78
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Scruffy brown fur

79
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
Cheap try to drag on the stage and I happen to a chair next gen

80
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay

81
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
So before we start I just want to ask the judges here one question

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Kind of set the terms

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
And make sure we all know what we're looking for

84
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
I want you guys to just Define intelligence

85
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
In three sentences

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
How did you find what you're looking for in the contestants

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Asteroids

88
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Robert Wayne

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Animal Inn

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,600
And I would say that a very smart animals

91
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Should be

92
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Asked

93
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
How well do you understand

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Expand your world

95
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Knowing that

96
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Summer sniffers and summer tasters in

97
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Summer Good Flyers with someone but really

98
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
When you see a fox

99
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
On a snowy day

100
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Jump into a

101
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Pound of snow

102
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
And somehow land right on the little mouse that's two feet down

103
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
I think that's a smart

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
Smart animal

105
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Jen

106
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
I think what I'm going to pay attention to

107
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
IR arguments on behalf of creatures where you see the creatures

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Encounter some kind of Ops

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Sickle

110
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
And then

111
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Problem solved their way around

112
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,887
Show pictures that are flexible can adapt very quickly

113
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,287
And I'm going to give a special nod I think two creatures that show Collective

114
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,359
Intelligencer like moral intelligence if that's even a thing

115
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Hokkaido that's what I'm going to be paid

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Okay good

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Macy

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
What do you think about how would you define intelligence Macy

119
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,719
She just repeating Chad really

120
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Phuket

121
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
We brought our contestants onto the stage

122
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
And Whitworth is they each had four minutes

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
Make a case for why they thought their animal ortho

124
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
The smartest

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
At the end of each round the judge

126
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Boat

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
And we bring out the next to Kin.

128
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
You already meet our contestants

00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
Okay

130
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Okay so first up we have

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Tracy Clayton

132
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Android nougat

133
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Tracy Clayton host the hit podcast another round

134
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047

Strong black Legends

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Sir

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Man

138
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
Andrew Mendoza is that comedian

139
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Central and a host

140
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
Alive science and comedy show in Brooklyn called drunks

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Okay so Tracy what

142
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
What animal did you bring for the

143
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,063
The smartest animal in the world hands down is the crow

144
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
I was just kidding

145
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
I know he meant that This Is War now this is a fight

146
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
What's your entry for this rent

147
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Slime mold

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
The first round

149
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Crow versus

150
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Slime mold where to start with Tracy

151
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Ready

152
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
If you don't know how amazing crows are as not your fault

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,087
It's because the media is racist and they told you how to feel about crows for example

154
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
Most famous crimes in the world are these

155
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Here you got the dumb the crows from Dumbo

156
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Address like Street pimp

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
5 crows were brightly colored

158
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Women smoking a cigar

159
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Shiftless lazy

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Black

161
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Coincidence I'm sure

162
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
And then here

163
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
This is a this is Jim Crow If you don't know that Google you got to do a Google

164
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
We don't have enough time

165
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Go

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Here is why crows are the best

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Number one

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
They are

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Extremely resource

170
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
Have you all heard of this dude named ASAP

171
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Heroes in Fable

172
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
One of them was about a crow who had to get like a

173
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
Treat or something out of like a picture or something

174
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
And so what he did was he dropped

175
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
Stones into the picture

176
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
Does the water level with raise

177
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Got what you want to guess what

178
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
Crows really do that for real in real life Ben Tracy showed a video of a

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
Crow and a half empty glass

180
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Water

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,903
Any Chromecast adding stones into the glass until the water was at the rim and the crow could get it

182
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Most of my ex's cannot

183
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
Do this

184
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Pro to solve problems

185
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
Puzzles with as many as 8 depth

186
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Definitely none of my

187
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
What number does

188
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Crows can be taught

189
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079

English words or human word

193
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Human

194
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,207
I'm Crow the songbirds y'all still the Ravens but you don't know that because you're not parrots and not brightly colored

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,839
They're black again racist

196
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
Be no it's not it's the doesn't count

197
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:12,799
But their vocalization skills are really really really good when you get a chance Google

198
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Talking Crow

199
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
And you'll find some videos I think we have one

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,855
Oh my God

201
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,439
Yep yep exactly

202
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Yeah that's an actual Crow crow look inside a scan Raven

203
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Point number

204
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
3B

205
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
C pointer BC

206
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
Crows have funerals right

207
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
But they have funerals for

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
Good reasons that the humans don't have funerals for good reason

209
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,431
But humans have funerals and make ourselves feel better like oh my God I miss big mama's so much I just need to

210
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,503
One more time before she goes on to the whatever in the sky

211
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
I thought we still have wait where we literally sit around and look at a dead body and wait for it to wake up even though we know it's not going

212
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
Evolve out of that please it's not as mad sin

213
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Black rose

214
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Have funeral

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Right though Rashad.

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Bless

217
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Just that he's

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
Rashad is the crow

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,335
So the crowds alike but cannot what it what is the cuss word

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,431
Things you can say whatever Hitman Rashad what the f***

221
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
What happened

222
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Install

223
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
All the crows like congregate around Rashad

224
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
To see what killed him so they can be like we need to stay away from whatever wish I was doing because

225
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Little Richard now you know

226
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Point number 4

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,471
Is that they can recognize faces for up to five years and hold grudges so if you walk past two-and-a-half years

228
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,567
They just like 9 don't fuk with this number here they thought all their friends

229
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
The next time you come around the crows are going to be

230
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
This motherfuker

231
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Don't trust him

232
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
It's amazing the explosion

233
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
Crocheted not be called a murder

234
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
They should be called something smarter like a symposium of

235
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
All right

236
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,423
Winter is here

237
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Next up with Jordan Mendoza with the slime mold

238
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
Repurpose slide of a petri dish with this

239
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,687
Yellow lightning bolt T streak going across it

240
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,759
What is this

241
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
But guys don't worry I freaking looked it up

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
A slime mold is a brainless single-celled

243
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Pulsating wad of yellow goo

244
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,863
I learned if you put a slime mold in an environment where there is a complex decision to make

245
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Princeton switch directory directions

246
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Choose to find a good food source

247
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,335
The superorganism can solve that problem relatively easily by spreading its cytoplasm out

248
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
Advancing and retreating in response to what

249
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
What is fine

250
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
So this is a superorganism

251
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Composed of thousands of nuclei

252
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
And they will collectively decide to make a decision for the group

253
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,999
Humans on the other hand are not at all good at collectively finding a good food source

254
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,143
Have you ever tried to order seamless with another person not easy

255
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
What are we going to do

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Pizza Korean Chinese sushi

257
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
My roommate and I always end up choosing diarrhea

258
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,199
There are three General types of slime molds

259
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Plasmodial slime molds

260
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Cellular slime molds

261
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
And Gary Busey

262
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
Jordan put up a picture of Gary Busey if AB

263
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
If you don't know you looks like

264
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Google

265
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,327
The joke here is that Gary Busey looks

266
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
And is like a slime mold

267
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
Plasmodial slime molds are masses of thousands of nuclei that move around by spreading out in a fractal pattern

268
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,407
Learning the lay of the land and even solving mazes and mapping Network

269
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Incredible efficiency

270
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
How efficient

271
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
It took human engineers

272
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
Years to map out a Tokyo rail

273
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
It took a slime molds

274
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Hours

275
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
I read that in an article titled watch this lyme-old dunk on Japanese engineers

276
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
I'm just kidding I made that article title up with that

277
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
The second type is a cellular slime mold and this spends most of his life as a single freewheeling amoeba

278
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
Which sounds like a sitcom that just got greenlit on Fox

279
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,807
This quirky freewheeling amoeba just got the consulting job of her dreams

280
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
Mackenzie balance love work and New York City

281
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,279
Check out all the single-celled ladies starring Zooey Deschanel as the slime mold

282
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Then turn around explain how slime mold look out for each other in this amazing way when one amoeba runs out of food

283
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Did something incredible happens it starts emitting chemical pulse

284
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
Assembling clusters of other amoeba into a larger

285
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Superorganism

286
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
This is a process called chemotaxis

287
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,943
Or if it's trying to save money

288
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Uberpool to find more food and then

289
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
When dies

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Chemotaxis shows that slime molds are altruistic

291
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
Being still sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the

292
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Species

293
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
I on the other hand

294
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
Will never die for the benefit of others

295
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
I won't even give my subway seat up to an elderly pregnant women who

296
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Repairing a piece of furniture

297
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
Finally the last category is slime mold

298
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Is Gary Busey

299
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
An oscar-nominated American actor who has appeared in over a hundred and fifty films including Lethal Weapon the firm and

300
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Piranha 3DD

301
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
In conclusion slime molds are very smart please vote for me because I'm Asian and if you don't vote for me that's right

302
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Did not know we could do that for the record

303
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Do diaper Dreamin designs

304
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
Okay judges

305
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,735
Deliberating asking questions with what are your reactions to these two

306
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,391
Bros vs Glenmoor multiplied so many times

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,535
Could come too complicated and sophisticated conclusions is a pretty impressive accomplishment

308
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Each individual

309
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
But also I

310
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
I was leaning in that direction but there's a sort of give

311
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
The crow a fair Shake

312
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Alyssa Crow

313
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,479
Can see if a person and then remember it and disseminate

314
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
The reputation

315
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
For two and a half years

316
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
So that that's some kind of crow

317
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Language

318
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,023
You have a crow feeling one way or the other

319
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
She does

320
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,263
She's saying that she's not sure that she knows that many

321
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Molds

322
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,919
Oklahoma City is a sort of dry town and they don't have a forests there

323
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
So she feels a little bit

324
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm equal to the challenge here

325
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
What would

326
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Oh well

327
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
She did study the ones

328
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,511
Do you speak dog rubber I understand that I can't

329
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,055
Okay well she is partial to Gary Busey which okay

330
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
I just confused her

331
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,943
Well let's let's let's vote when we go down the line Chad what do you choose

332
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
I think just

333
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
On I think I'm going to have to go to the

334
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Slime mold

335
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,415
Wow after giving up for Crows okay so Jed slime old Robert

336
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
I under eye in a with great respect for cross that hate well I I agree they can but I'm I'm going to go

337
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
With the slime mold as well

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Amazing

339
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Macy

340
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
What are we what do we have for Macy

341
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Crowd surprising

342
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:22,527
Alright alright surprising For Your Love of Gary Busey from

343
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Took the judges voted in favor of the

344
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Slime mold

345
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
An app that we brought up our next

346
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Set of contestants

347
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Depend a whole new pair

348
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Okay

349
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
Let's get our next contestant up here

350
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,399
Laurel braitman and Dan Egbert give it up everybody

351
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
An ember is a writer for slate and the New York Times magazine

352
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,103
And all right man is the author of the best-selling book animal Madness and a teacher at Stanford

353
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Laurel

354
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
What I animal are you entering into the mix

355
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Sperm whales

356
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Hermleigh I'm way okay good

357
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
And then what will you be bringing to the table to chicken

358
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
David chicken

359
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
Okay

360
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
Okay I will start

361
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
With Laurel

362
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Take it away

363
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Sperm whales

364
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Are huge

365
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
The biggest toothed whales

366
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
But in a lot of ways

367
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
They're like us

368
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
They have big brands

369
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
And really complex socialized

370
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
But unlike us

371
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
They live in a matriarchal culture

372
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
They probably even have stronger social and emotional bonds than we do

373
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,815
Young males go off on their own to find a new pod and then everyone else stays together for life

374
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,679
Sperm whales communicate a lot like us to physically and with

375
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,031
But they also have a third way and I think we should consider it like

376
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Sense

377
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,919
Maybe you think about echolocation like boat sonar

378
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Like a ping goes out

379
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
And then it bounces of the sound bounces off

380
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Nothing in their environment in the

381
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Comes back

382
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
And giving give that boat like a grainy shape of whatever

383
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
A dolphin and whale sonar does this too and so do bats

384
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
But animal sonar also comes back as a physical feeling

385
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
In a case of sperm whales is really loud

386
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
They make the loudest sound

387
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Any animal on Earth

388
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
Up to 230 decibels

389
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
I know

390
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,015
Is actually it's louder than standing next to a jet engine at

391
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
Are eardrums can rupture at 150.

392
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,695
Which is basically like a gun going off next to your head

393
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Sperm whales make these click

394
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Creaking and buzzing sound in their knees

395
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,167
And then they amplify and direct them with this big fatty wack

396
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Taxi organ in their forehead

397
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,287
Called the melon and it's like

398
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
I know it's

399
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Terrible where they probably have another word for it

400
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
But it's like a huge built-in megaphone in their head

401
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Just like that but way louder like

402
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,631
Read aloud so loud that it would have hurt us to be listening to

403
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,519
And this echolocation is so powerful that if they can track a squid up to a mile away

404
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
And their social messages

405
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Probably travel just as far

406
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
So knowing what we know is are really complex social lives

407
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
Expense likely comes with its own emotional

408
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Experiences to

409
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
But we can't name those because we don't know what those feelings are

410
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
So

411
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
I want you to try to imagine it

412
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
What would it be like to be like

413
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Reading a book

414
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
What's suddenly finding out

415
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Just by feeling it

416
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,471
But your ex girlfriend is coming around the corner of an underwater Shelf

417
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
A half a mile away

418
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Now

419
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
She broke up with you

420
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Matriarchal culture

421
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,831
You been so lonely but now you know the signal is meant for you just because of how it feels

422
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
When you pick it up

423
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
And not only that but you have an immediate accurate picture of exactly what she looks like not just the shape of her

424
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,863
But the perfect curve of her jaw her sexy 12 inch layer of blubber

425
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
That you've missed

426
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
But also you can also immediately tell how much

427
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,591
She cares about you too and that's why she's coming

428
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
Also you've been hunting a giant squid

429
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,807
Might have a particular emotion that goes along with experiences

430
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Any maybe even have a different sense of

431
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
In the mid-1980s a neuropsychologist named Harry Garrison

432
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,071
Proposed that are collocated Communications that are emotional and nature

433
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
For joy

434
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Might be

435
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,239
Experience by whales and dolphins as more than shared information they at

436
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Actually might come in as shared feelings

437
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Shared emotional

438
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Experiences

439
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,199
Jerrison thought that this might give rise to something called the communal self

440
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Meaning whales and dolphins might not say

441
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,087
I they might always be a we

442
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
We are sad

443
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
We are

444
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
And there's some evidence for this

445
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
So like in whale strandings for example

446
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
When a bunch of whales

447
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
We'll come up to the shore and strand themselves and die

448
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
But when we actually

449
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,752
Do studies on the way we find out that maybe only one or two and 100 was actually sick

450
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Something is going on here and I think it may be

451
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
We sick

452
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Stop

453
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
I don't want to end on that super sad no guys

454
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,112
It also might be why whales in

455
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to tell you one really nice singing

456
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
Turn it over to the mystery mystery animal

457
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,656
It also might be why dolphins and whales are

458
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,752
So many reports of them coming to the aid of swimmers who are struggling

459
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,824
Or fending off sharks from somebody who really needs

460
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Action or help

461
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
Or even doing things like this which I love

462
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
This is a case of

463
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,736
Sperm whales who adopted a deformed dolphin

464
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
So if I'm golfing with us

465
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
Spinal abnormality who they welcomed into their pod

466
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
So

467
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
Sperm whales man

468
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
What looks like extreme empathy to us

469
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
Might just Demby being themselves

470
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,144
Or maybe it's a new kind of intelligence

471
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
One that requires

472
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,520
A kind of communal feeling as opposed to thoughts about other people's

473
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Thank you

474
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
Okay well done

475
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Very good

476
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
All right

477
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Next up

478
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Denenberg

479
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
Breakfast chicken

480
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
Let me start with s

481
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
A chicken

482
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
Can beat a human in tic tac toe

483
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
A chicken almost always

484
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Pizza human in tic-tac-toe

485
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
I learn this back

486
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
In high school when my friend Rob

487
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
Obsessed with one particular

488
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Chateau plain chicken named Willie

489
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Who lived at the video arcade at Mott Street

490
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Add Willie beat RAB

491
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
Over and over and over again it's

492
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Tic-tac-toe

493
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
Willie wasn't unique birds like him we're one

494
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
A pretty common Carnival attraction their popularity

495
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,096
Peaked in the early 80s when train chickens were shipped around the country

496
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
Rent it out for $200 a day

497
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Or sold for several thousand dollars each

498
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,544
Annies chickens were so good at Tic-tac-toe

499
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
That humans were getting demoralized

500
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,944
At least one distributor started having the birds lose on purpose

501
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Every fifth game

502
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
To make it seem more fair

503
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,696
How it turned out this whole thing it started years earlier in the south at a place called the IQ zoo in Hot Springs Ark

504
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
There

505
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
A pair of scientists Marion

506
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
And Keller Breland head build a business out of training up strange animal behavior

507
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,216
There's it was like a product showroom a place to demo

508
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
The Ducks they talked

509
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
How to play piano

510
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
Rabbits the drove around and little fire truck search

511
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Hamsters on trapeze

512
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
Butterfree

513
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
You don't have to be that smart to go on trapeze

514
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
The prelims mosto

515
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Popular in during Act

516
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
What's the bird brand

517
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,816
A chicken in a box which disappeared behind a screen to Packo's onto a game board

518
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Chinatown Willie with one of those or maybe

519
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,752
Someone else's knockoff in any case I watch that chicken play a lot of tic tac toe

520
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,824
Peering over my shoulder I tried to figure out

521
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
Chicken secret strategy

522
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
But then

523
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Last week

524
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Really last week

525
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
I discovered that all those observations were

526
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:59,648
Preferred not as I got ready for tonight's talk I stumbled across a copy of an old instruction manual

527
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
What's the breland's

528
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
Would send out with her bird rain units

529
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
According to that manual

530
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Chicken in the Box

531
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
Wasn't really playing Tic-Tac-Toe at all in fact

532
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,216
Behind the screen there's nothing but a single light bulb and a switch

533
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
When the light went on the chickenpox

534
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,616
Headed out to appeared somewhere on the board in the spot chosen by computer

535
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
I found this

536
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
Kind of devastating

537
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
Partly because I promised had a talk on the intelligence

538
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
The chicken

539
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
But here's the reality

540
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Chickens are kind of dumb

541
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,912
As we seen their even dumb compared to other birds they don't

542
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Have funerals

543
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
You know they're not

544
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
I or make tools like crows

545
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:52,640
They don't learn to speak like parrots in fact if a chicken has any special talents at all

546
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
Is that when you chop off its head it can go on acting

547
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Like a chicken

548
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
4 days or weeks or even months

549
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
But still I think there's something amazing about Willie and the other bird brain

550
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
It's not that these chickens were smart enough to beat us at Tic Tac

551
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Because they weren't

552
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Is that we humans

553
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,472
We're dumb enough to lose

554
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
I mean

555
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
Tic-tac-toe is not a complicated game actually

556
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
If you can think of had just a bit you ought to be able to play any round of tic tac toe to withdraw even against the computer and yeah

557
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,856
It seems we humans can't or won't succeed even at this

558
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,160
Very modest test of our intelligence

559
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,256
I think that's useful to remember especially tonight

560
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Because this whole

561
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Project

562
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,376
2-ranked species according to their smarts takes it as a given

563
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
The ugliest exists between the very dumbest in the very smartest animals that the chicken and the chimpanzee or the spur

564
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
Sperm whale or the crow live on separate continents of cognition

565
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
But I call that vanity

566
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
That's what Willie taught us that

567
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,016
There we were standing the same arcade

568
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Befuddled by the same computer

569
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,392
Each unable to succeed at the same simple game

570
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
We were joined together across

571
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,280
Several hundred million years of evolution by what we couldn't do

572
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Judges

573
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
A boat for chicken

574
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
Is a vote for finding that common ground

575
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
If the vote for Unity

576
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
Absentia

577
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
I vote for chicken

578
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
It's about for all of us

579
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,744
Okay wow

580
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
So

581
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
This is reading our heartfelt together continuum

582
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
What I would I

583
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
I don't even know what what are you which way are you leaning

584
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
I did not know that stuff about the sperm whale actually played

585
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,064
I'm at speed with the China Township in the 1980s so I probably should not have lost

586
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,928
So I don't know whether the other judge

587
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Is awake

588
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Butner

589
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
At this point Macy had that curled up in

590
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
You all can take a backseat of judging this is like the Merrell

591
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Cheapest vacation I mean

592
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
If we were better humans

593
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,104
We would have the kind of antenna and radar that a great actress would have what you can just somehow

594
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Project

595
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Return

596
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,224
You go to a movie night with her and you go

597
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
Your every move she makes like

598
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Touches you

599
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Why can't I quit

600
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,416
I am enthralled by this

601
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
With what you saying

602
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
Doesn't like Streep

603
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,168
With jacuzzis she's a blood waves

604
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,520
Starter solenoid

605
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
She's feeling Street right now

606
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
Can I ask if I see question about the best formula is

607
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,272
Isn't all emotion somehow it is fits a physical physical rap

608
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,624
So is it a question degrees is it somehow they are experiencing that

609
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
Or is it an entirely different kind of intelligence

610
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
I think that they have another way of

611
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Accessing their emotional

612
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
Then we do so they have everything we have

613
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Write like their friend can go up and clap them on the back or

614
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Giving up

615
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,824
Sperm whale hug or whatever they still have that and they also have language but then they have his other thing

616
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
Which item just because

617
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
I avoid my inbox or whatever

618
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
It feels like some form of email right like you send it at a great distance

619
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
What is emotional and you pick it up with your face

620
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,840
I I think I got it ice my heart go sperm well I thought the political platform I vote chicken

621
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,680
But my heart says

622
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
It's a good service to you both I guess perfume

623
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
I go sperm

624
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
Sperm whale 2

625
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
But this point the first round was finished at the judges

626
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,416
Waitin on some pretty compelling cases for

627
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
The crow the spine mold

628
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Sperm whale and the chicken

629
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
Next up we have another round of competition same basic idea we asked each of our four contestants to frame

630
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
A smart animal

631
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Table to make a case for

632
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
But this time we threw a couple curveballs at them

633
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,872
Matt and the final crowning of the world's smartest animal

634
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
After a quick break

635
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,480
This is me and Arisa from amps

636
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Radiolab

637
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
Enhancing public understanding of Science and

638
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Knology

639
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Modern world

640
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
More information

641
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
Monat

642
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Www

643
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
Scott Sloan.

644
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,288
So in part one of our competition we heard Arguments for the intelligent

645
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Of The Crow

646
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Define mold

647
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Sperm whale and the chicken

648
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,456
And in part 2 we decided to raise the stakes a little

649
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
I give our competitors a couple more chine

650
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
The first challenge is that they are now going to have to compete with their nemesis from the first round

651
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,256
Turn around at 2 on to round

652
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,096
The other challenge we gave them is we noticed that

653
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
We weren't really paying that much attention to the furry mammals I think a lot of us imagined that we may be amongst

654
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,104
Smartest animals in in the in the animal kingdom and some of us want yeah

655
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,992
Let's do some furry mammals but the challenge was not to do any of The Usual Suspects

656
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Texto no humans of course

657
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,344
No chimpanzees no elephants

658
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
I know dogs are messy

659
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,488
Come up with an unexpectedly smart

660
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Furry mammal

661
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,864
I with your with your new former enemy team a

662
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
So

663
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Brush up where Dan and Laurel who had

664
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
Absolutely

665
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,544
No trouble at all agreeing on a smart for a man

666
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Obviously raccoon

667
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
OG is Animal Kingdom been showing us how to live

668
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
Cities for really long time

669
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,856
There is no other choice

670
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Why are we talking about this

671
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
Loretta no-brainer

672
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
All right

673
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
In the fall of 1906

674
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
22 wyndance

675
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:48,640
In the fall of 1906 this headline smart raccoons was picked up by several major newspapers

676
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
The column underneath

677
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
Describe the mister and misses goal apart

678
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,344
Who been traveling from town to town in a double-decker covered wagon

679
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
Bonita family of trained raccoons that work for them

680
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Is Chimney Sweep

681
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
Who's not the only story of its kind

682
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
In those years

683
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,912
Raccoons were often touted by reporters for their high intelligence

684
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,728
What are sagacity order Skillet making mischief

685
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:19,104
This is the odd and tragic story of how we came to understand briefly a century ago

686
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
That raccoons were among the very shrewdest animals of all

687
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
And then

688
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
We forgot

689
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
The link between animals

690
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,160
Slipperiness and it's smarts was once well established among scientist

691
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,024
At Columbia University Edward Thorndike have been testing the intelligence of cats and dogs

692
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
By locking them in box

693
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Heat seal the box with latches Bolt

694
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
String police

695
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
Leave a snack

696
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Motivation

697
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
This was

698
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Houdini

699
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
In the lab

700
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
An escape room

701
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
But for animal

702
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
Then in 1907

703
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:59,296
Psychologist in Oklahoma named Lawrence Wooster call thought to put raccoon through the same puzzle boxes to learn

704
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,880
If you put it there proper place in the scale of mammalian and television

705
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
And he found some amazing things

706
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,768
His raccoons Tom Jim Jack

707
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
And Dolly

708
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,448
What did X Break Free of the puzzle box and then ignore the food reward it was as if they'd gone through the exercise

709
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,288
Turn service of their hunger is other animals by 2 but

710
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
To satisfy an inner curiosity

711
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,688
Cole also found that his raccoons unlike cat

712
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,760
Could learn to escape a given box just by watching humans

713
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Based on this and other work

714
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:37,952
A soft consensus came together and psychology that raccoons were in fact quite high on the scales mammalian intelligence

715
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
Much higher than a cat

716
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Weird dog

717
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
At any rate and maybe even on a par with primates

718
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
But alas

719
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
This whole idea was soon to be challenged

720
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Had erased

721
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
In the same year Cole publisher

722
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Research

723
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
The president Teddy Roosevelt lashed out against the tendency of nature writers to ascribe

724
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
Human-like abilities to raccoons and other animals

725
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,040
The president was an avid Outdoorsman called this fake news

726
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,048
Within a few years some of Cole's most impressive findings with raccoons were challenged by his peers

727
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
Even scientists

728
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:21,472
Who believed in Kohl's research would find it hard to follow up for one thing the raccoon say meant to study

729
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
Escaping

730
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,920
Add a new paradigm was spreading through psychology one that had little time from using sauna raccoons imagination or

731
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Real City

732
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
What's loneliness

733
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,296
In place of Tom and Jim and Jack and Dolly

734
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
There were rats

735
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Nameless rat

736
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,256
Do raccoons banished from the lab and then As Cities grew they vanished from our lives

737
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Out of sight

738
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
And for a while

739
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
How to find

740
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
But

741
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,056
Turns out as people moved out of the country and into the cities are raccoons followed us

742
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,688
Urban spaces aren't just the perfect place for raccoons to demonstrate their intelligence

743
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Butts

744
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
I argue that they are also

745
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Making them even smarter

746
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,232
Today though the people that know the most about Urban raccoons are the people whose job it is to get them out of our Urban spaces

747
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
Like Mr Raccoon

748
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
AKA

749
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Junio Costa

750
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,960
The number-one no-kill Humane raccoon Trapper of the California Bay Area

751
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,384
He told me that the animals are bold and curious and he pretty much everything

752
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Raccoons move into your attic

753
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
Enter crawl spaces they study us

754
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,320
The user tiny sensitive hands to manipulate lock

755
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
And laugh

756
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
Or pray out Loose nails

757
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,184
Thenar things open and then they take

758
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
Running leaps also to knock things over

759
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
A raccoon will work on a problem like lifting up a garage door or prying open a window or praying event

760
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Vent cover off of a basement

761
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,008
4 hours until they figure it out

762
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,872
Sometimes it'll come back like night after night to work on the problem until they see

763
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
And once they do they keep coming back

764
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,040
Mr. raccoon told me that once he got a call every night

765
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
From the same neighborhood for like 2 weeks

766
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,976
Because one ambitious raccoon figured out they were all tract homes and so

767
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,840
What would work to get into one of these tracks houses with work in the entire neighborhood so she just went house-to-house

768
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
The house the house

769
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Stop

770
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,520
Recruiter really the old one of the only animal species to fare better

771
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
As humans spread all over the planet

772
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Not only that

773
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
But we re

774
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Problems for

775
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Each other

776
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
They try to outsmart us

777
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
We try to outsmart

778
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
It's unclear to me which of us is getting more intelligent faster

779
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,976
Picked up where Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza

780
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Endive animal was

781
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
A little harder than that

782
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,264
Type of mammal or type of mammal marsupial

783
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
Yeah okay have our own individual

784
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,968
Traci kicked off 14 marsupial with this adorable little creature called the quokka

785
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:17,088
Which looks more like a chubby squirrel with teddy bear eyes and little black

786
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,976
I think we're having literally if you're if you haven't had hold on to it

787
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,512
If you're sitting in the chair

788
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Hold on to the

789
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
Hold on to your boy

790
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,960
Sam Jackson I thought that the response would be okay

791
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,520
This ladies and gentlemen not to oversell it is

792
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Is the most

793
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Amazing animal facts

794
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Do whatever here

795
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
In your life

796
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Are you ready

797
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
Judges are you ready

798
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Maybe

799
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
She's into it

800
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Kids on the pocket is a smartest anime

801
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Serious business

802
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
When

803
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Try today

804
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
We're going to get through this as a family I swear

805
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,520
Okay when approached by a predator

806
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,080
Apparent quokka

807
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,176
I don't know if it's the dad the mom do you know pronouns I don't know their lives

808
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
Approached by a predator

809
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
If a parent

810
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
With a child

811
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
They will throw the child at

812
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:27,232
The Predator to distract it

813
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,864
While it runs away I need to describe this image

814
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,264
For the people who cannot do at this point Tracy had an illustration up in the screen of

815
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,848
Passing a baby into a bad car

816
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,576
Batman Arkham you know this is really smart

817
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
Cuz you make another one

818
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
You can make

819
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
You know

820
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
If the both of y'all die

821
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Because

822
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:08,192
Did your dad attached to your child then what happens to your genetic line it doesn't get passed on

823
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
This way

824
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Crab legs

825
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Oh s***

826
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
I like Emily but

827
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
I can make another I can make Emily II

828
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Emily

829
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,504
Parham and that's that the crocodiles on the Live Another Day

830
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,600
The crocodile don't survive longer than anyone else well

831
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Thank you

832
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
It's your turn if you

833
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,192
Is very funny I am scared and Jordans decided to fight for

834
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Kind of a weird

835
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:46,592
So boy supposed to be a presentation

836
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
The smartest animal is

837
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
And a long time ago I was like

838
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
Yeah I'm going to do koalas

839
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:57,344
But then I looked it up and apparently koalas are famously stupid

840
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,000
Here's how dumb koalas are their brains only take 2% of their body mass

841
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,584
Which is Apparently one of the smallest brain to body mass ratios

842
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
Any mammal

843
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
Clothes brands are also super smooth which is bad because

844
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
The more folds your brain has the

845
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
The smarter you are

846
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,848
The human brain is like Marie kondo lots of folding

847
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,456
Shout out to my condo heads out there sparking Joy

848
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
You Know Who You Are

849
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,392
Honestly I love her so much

850
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Ozark

851
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,256
So dumb they even sound dumb listen to this

852
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,407
Perhaps koalas aren't conventionally intelligent

853
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,271
Just like how choosing koalas for this presentation wasn't conventionally intelligent

854
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,159
But I propose that we rethink intelligence

855
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
Partly because I'm stuck with this animal but mostly because I believe that this animal is in many ways smarter than us

856
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,143
Perhaps koalas are like how my mom describes me

857
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,215
Smart in their own special way

858
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
Let's compare koalas and humans

859
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Sissy who look smart bike

860
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Comparison

861
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
This is a koalas daily schedule

862
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
A koala sleeps 20 hours a day

863
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,807
While the remaining four hours they spend eating and mating

864
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
Incredible

865
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
Imagine only being awake for the amount of hours you need to

866
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
To eat and have sex

867
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:43,839
I mean I'm not a huge fan of sex because I'm quote-unquote awful at it but boy do I love eating

868
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,679
The human schedule on the other hand is horrendous

869
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
Weekly Pond average 6.8 hours a night

870
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,359
We wait for my nightmares then spend 10 hours reading emails and worrying

871
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
5 hours on a conference call

872
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:03,551
In 2 hours eating dinner out of a big bowl while watching billions and hoping to God that Paul Giamatti voice can Lola

873
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
What's to sleep again

874
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,439
In conclusion koalas have optimized themselves for Life's greatest gift

875
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Eating

876
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Having sex

877
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:16,607
Those who enjoy that kind of thing and sleeping without the need to listen to Paul giamatti's voice

878
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
And that

879
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Smart

880
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
Now who sounds

881
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Stupid

882
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Still calling

883
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
I realize I clapped with everyone else

884
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:43,231
You know what I am proud of myself

885
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Feeding a koala would have done that

886
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
Wow okay so

887
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,847
We've heard from both the hairs

888
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Raccoons

889
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Marsupials

890
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
Quokka and

891
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Dum /

892
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
Smart qua

893
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
So after that but proceed with you guys it was time for the final judging there's a lot.

894
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,279
Taking their a lot of different arguments were put forward I

895
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Think I got to give this to the marsupial

896
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:26,239
Duet alright alright alright

897
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
I missed your call which

898
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:37,247
Well I was I was I was impressed by the boldness of the chicken of the

899
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:43,647
But before I got a chance to always win

900
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:49,791
Raymond has walked a giant bone across the stage and giving it to Macy the dog judge

901
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:56,191
A pretty curious incident of bribery went down

902
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,591
Don't you do it to keep things Fair we decided to just throw the whole thing over to the audio

903
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
The boat with their Applause

904
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
After their take

905
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
On this murder

906
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Animal abuse

907
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,551
So just to recap the contenders were the crow the slime mold

908
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,343
Sperm whale the chicken

909
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
The raccoon and Marcy

910
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,695
And the winter going to be audience

911
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
What does

912
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
I think

913
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
If I think it's pretty clear who the winner is

914
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
Elasta QP

915
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
A drum roll

916
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
Yeah right

917
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Drum roll please

918
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
