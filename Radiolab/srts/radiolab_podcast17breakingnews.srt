Comment

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Is kind of crystal ball

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
Try to predict what

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
The next five

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
10-15 years would look like for the media industry you have a good batting record like that did you did you call some big wild

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
You know

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,272
Songs in our pockets that would be like supercomputers

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
The social media would drive news

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
Not newspapers and so on and things like that so

34
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Yeah it's it's

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,048
It's been pretty good I reached out to you because I I came across this article that you wrote an article that

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
Send shivers down my spine and I'm not one to

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Typically be given Shivers by article so I guess how did you stumble into all of

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
Who is this and where did where does it start for you

39
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
So I was sitting around with some friends

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
In my living room and

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Friend of mine mentioned out did you see this thing that adobe put out recently

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392

00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Believe that they can change the world

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,792

00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
Of a Apple product launch but Serta beach-themed

50
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Keegan-Michael Key have been nominated

And I kiss my dogs and my wife

78
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
In that order

79
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
Not a bad joke so that's still supposed to send this

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Audio to his wife

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
In other words what if Keegan-Michael Key was feeling like that was a little bit rough on my wife I was a little bit mean

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
You know maybe if you wanted to

83
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Going to rewrite history

84
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Say that he kissed his wife

85
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Before

To go before the dogs

89
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
So

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Okay so what do we do

91
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
Easily

92
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
The button automatically generated

93
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
Transcript of the audio and projects it up on the screen behind him

94
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
You nope just text of what keegan michael Key

95
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
He said a little bit

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
And then copy paste

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,823
Judith highlights the word wife and pastes it over in front of dogs

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,199
Okay let's listen to it quick play and I kiss my wife and my dogs

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Oh so he was able to move the edit the audio by moving the

00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Next round in a textbox exactly

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
Okay well that's kind of cool kind of impressive

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
But then

103
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
We have to type something that's not here

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Wait

105
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775

00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Siri, the truth let's go is back in that little word box that's removed

110
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Your secret's out

111
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Type of word

112
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Jordan

113
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Protected. Jordan

114
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,095
Ann just be clear a Keegan-Michael Key did not say Jordan anywhere in this

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,495
And my dogs

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,639
What you just typed in word that the guy never said and it made the guy say the word

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
He never said

118
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
As if he actually said it

119
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,759
Exactly

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Jordan's jumped out of his lifeguard chair there so to stomping around the stage

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Oh yeah

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,791
Magic how can I show you guys is

123
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
We talked Lee pipes small phrases

124
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Play

125
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
Okay so you delete the words my dog's any types free

126
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
And 3 time

127
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
You were saying

128
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,231
The Keegan-Michael Key never said ever said Jordan never said

129
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
3 never said

130
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
X

131
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,655
Any of those words in somehow just from the typing in it the guy is now

132
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Saying and we're healing in his voice

133
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
That's what just happened

134
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Yep that is exactly what the Democratic

135
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
It's essentially Photoshop

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
4 audio Nick Bilton again

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
You can take

138
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
As little as 20 minutes

139
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Someone's voice

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Type the words and it

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Create

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
And that boys

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
That's in 20 minutes of the guy talking

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Yes what how

145
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
How is

146
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Heaven

147
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Do you do this

148
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
We're here the Dobby what what exactly do you do here

149
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Sure I'm the product manager for audio

150
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
This is Drake leaves

151
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
I flew out to Seattle and tracked him down to ask him exactly that Quest

152
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
So essentially what it does is it doesn't analysis of the speech and it creates a model

153
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
It basically

154
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,527
Explain to me that this program which they called Boku by the way

155
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
What it does is it takes 20 minutes

156
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Actually 40

157
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
If you're the best results

158
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
Have you talking and it figures out all the

159
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
Genetics of your speech all of the sounds you make a block of sound and speech that

160
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,167
What is in the recordings chop them all up and then when you go in type things in it will recombine those

161
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Into that new word

162
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
What if it encounters are sound that I never made

163
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,175
Wella the theory is in 40 minutes of speech which is the amount they recommend you feed in your goodness

164
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Probably say just about every sound

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Written English language

166
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,647
Is really sore like phonetically I go I run through the gamut and in 40 minutes

167
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Yes

168
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
Like what would you or what are you hoping people will would use

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
A product like

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Like foco

171
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,775
So for the video production tools and in for what i dishin is used for a lot of dialogue editing

172
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,407
The whole idea during said is to help people that work in movies and TV a lot of our customers

173
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
Record great audio on set

174
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
Actors in The dialogues Never

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
And when they come back

176
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
If sometimes there's a mistake or they make a change

177
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
Like the actor on set said shoe

178
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
But what he was pointing at was obviously

179
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Sabu and right now there's they do what's called a Dr

180
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Belt bring the actor in the

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Rerecord

182
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Wines and I'll try and drop that into the video

183
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
You're not using the same microphones you're not me

184
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Kissing location the actor Midas

185
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Sick that day so is voice sounds different in a lot of times you can really hear that stand out in in Productions if they don't get it

186
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,831
Boku you just delete the word shoe type in Boot & Boom

187
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
There it is

188
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Using the same

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Source media and the same characteristics

190
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
And have it just sounds seamless and Hatcher

191
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
And so is it is

192
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
It's going to be a sort of

193
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
The hope is that it will make

194
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,703
The lives of professional post-production edges easier for world over

195
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
That's our hope right now

196
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
But that's not exactly

197
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
I mean it's

198
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
What

199
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Nick Bilton. When when he saw the

200
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,551
This video could be Donald Trump's Voice or Vladimir Putin

201
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
So I saw that and I thought wow

202
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
If imaginative

203
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Audio clips

204
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
Start getting shared around the internet

205
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
Is fake news fake conversation between

206
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
You know Vladimir Putin Paul manafort

207
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
About trying to get Trump into the White House or something like that

208
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
I was like what this is

209
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
This is scary stuff

210
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
But

211
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
We're just getting started

212
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,247
In the words of John Raymond Arnold played by Samuel L Jackson in the movie Jurassic Park in his own voice

213
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Hold onto your butt

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Things are about to get a lot

215
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Forget voices first

216
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Second because now 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4

217
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Are we art

218
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Paul g Allen Center at the University of Washington in Seattle when across town to

219
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Talk to the head of

220
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Grail

221
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Laugh

222
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
Versailles Apartments near SW 6th and Elsa work at Chase

223
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Okay just a backup for a second when Nick first saw the vocal

224
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,399
Demonstration keep starting to wonder how could this be used on the road

225
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983
The my original thesis was I will maybe what will happen is that

226
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
You will be able to

227
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
Create 3D Act

228
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Just like you didn't Star Wars

229
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
Benjani with the Valco stuff to create a fake Hillary Clinton

230
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,831
And you know Donald Trump having a conversation or making out or whatever it is you want to do

231
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
And that led him to investigate the type of work that you're a dud

232
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
Driving using these terms like facial

233
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
Reenactment and facial manipulation of what the hell do these words

234
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Me

235
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Yasso

236
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
I mean it's a way of animating faces

237
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
End

238
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,407
It Started from the movies right remotely control bodies with avatars

239
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
Think like the aptly-named movie Avatar

240
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Or a

241
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
Going a little further back

242
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,159
Intelligent life anywhere Toy Story

243
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
How to make the characters come alive what you need is deep

244
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Expressions of the actors playing them

245
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
What's the movie space it means that

246
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
You will bring a person to a studio

247
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Then you

248
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Your face with you

249
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Sticky sensory marker things

250
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
And then you'll spend hours hours hours

251
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Capturing

252
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
The fastest little Dynamics

253
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Like smile

254
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
Keep a smile no teeth had

255
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Surprised

256
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
Disturbed angry bloated

257
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,111
In front that they create a virtual character capable of emoting all those

258
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,975
Expressions in to make that character believable the animator's sometimes have to model

259
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Bone structure and muscles

260
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
And if you can imagine this can get very very

261
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
So what people like your ass started to wonder was like

262
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Can this be done on a bike

263
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,567
So she and others in the field started feeding videos of faces into computers and

264
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Train those computers

265
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
To break down the face into a series of points

266
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,783
Armada starter bolts 250 by 250 that is 62500 points

267
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
On one human

268
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
Face and wants to know that's right to get ragged point

269
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,999
Once you can track how my face move through a video clip by

270
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
250 x 250

271
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Points

272
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
What can you then do with that information

273
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Well

274
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,239
I can apply the points on the face on a

275
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Difference

276
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Model of a different person

277
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Now this is this is where things get

278
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Quite strange

279
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Because

280
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,551
Instead of being able to map all of your facial movements onto a computer-generated

281
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Virtual character or purse

282
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,927
Whittier and others in this field of

283
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Facial reenactment have figured out how to do

284
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,863
Is to map your facial moving on to a real person

285
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
A pre-recorded real person

286
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
What does that even mean

287
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
The best example of this is I is this

288
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Piece of software that Nick showed us

289
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Add the software that I found

290
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
From the University student

291
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
Called face2face real-time facial reenactment method that works with any Community webcam

292
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
Download this and when you open it up at this very monotone voice comes in saying

293
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
Uses RGB data for both the source and Target actor

294
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,655
Set up on the right you got this heavyset man

295
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Goatee

296
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Spiked hair on the right Source actor is captured with a standard webcam

297
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Arching his eyebrows

298
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
He's pressing his lips

299
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,967
She's opening his mouth widely sir like a like if you're making funny faces for a two-year-old kind of thing yeah

300
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
And then this input drives animation of

301
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
The face in the video shown on the monitor to the left

302
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
On the left you got this

303
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,207
Dell computer screen displaying a CNN clip of George Bush

304
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
This is a real clip of bush back from 2013 and his face is there looking right at the

305
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
The camera occupies most of that screen

306
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
You start to notice is up

307
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,799
When the man with the goatee smiles

308
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
George Bush in the CNN clip

309
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Also

310
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Smiles and when the man raises his eyebrows George Bush raises his eyebrows

311
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
You realize this man is complete

312
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,903
Trolling George Bush's fake wait so this is a guy in the present controlling a

313
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
He passed

314
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,559
George Bush a real George Bush when old video clip

315
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,191
A little while back when we were just learning about this up we happen to have her friend Andrew Marantz

316
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Who writes for the New Yorker in the studio

317
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
So that is George Bush

318
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
His face

319
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
What

320
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Oh God

321
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Oh God

322
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
That's

323
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Terrifying

324
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
His

325
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
Okay so yeah I cannot stop watching George Bush's face

326
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Putin now holy God so

327
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
I just have a guy just sort of

328
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
Going around Aurora

329
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
And then that's what

330
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Goodness doing

331
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
You know what I mean those videos online

332
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Had my mouth

333
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Again victim

334
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,639
This is this this is a form of puppetry where

335
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
Your face is the is the Puppeteer in the only thing is is that

336
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
George W bush

337
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
The puppet so I sit in front of a camera

338
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
I smile and the business is taken care of this isn't like you have to render some software on your computer

339
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
Peter it's literally you download

340
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
Clip or you take a clip from cable news

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
And you turn on your webcam

342
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
However long it takes you to do what you've done

343
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Same as the shooting a video on your phone

344
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
What is this for

345
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Applications of this

346
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
I want to be able to

347
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Help

348
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Calvados

349
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Telepresence

350
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
This is Sarah again

351
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
So

352
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Telepresence telepresence

353
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Self example

354
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
So my Mom leaves in Israel

355
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
And I'm here

356
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
NCI

357
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
What is be cool if I could

358
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
Have some guys it's kind of crazy but right but

359
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
If I could have

360
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Some kind of hologram

361
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Of her

362
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Sitting on my couch

363
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Cher

364
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
And we can

365
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Have a conversation

366
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Going one step further one of your is colleagues a guy by the name of Steve Seitz and the professor at the University of Washington and I also

367
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
So work part-time at Google

368
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
He told me that they see this technology as

369
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Like a building block

370
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
That could one day be used to essentially

371
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Virtually bring someone back from the dead

372
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
I just think this technology

373
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
Combined with virtual reality

374
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,351
Other Innovations could help me you know just be there in the room with

375
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Albert Einstein

376
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Carl Sagan

377
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
That that's about it

378
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
That's what they want to do that's the motivation

379
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,847
Ghosts for them yes and

380
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
When I was talking to some folks

381
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,711
Who work in commercials they're developing their own version of

382
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
And the idea is that they're going to make a million or billion dollars

383
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Because I say you bring

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Jennifer Aniston

385
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
In

386
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
To film some makeup

387
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,423
And in the makeup commercial in English she says so coming by this product this is the best sort of whatever product

388
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,591
Right now you got China which is a booming Market you maybe want to Market things to China and you'd really like to be able to use Jennifer

389
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Problem is Jennifer Aniston doesn't

390
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Speak Mandarin

391
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
So either you use the same audio clip and you have someone come in and speak Mandarin

392
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Over her in the lips don't line up

393
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,975
Or you have to hire a mandarin-speaking actor to come in

394
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
And do the part of Jennifer Aniston

395
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
With this technology

396
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
All you have to do is record Jennifer Aniston once

397
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
You can hire a mandarin speaker

398
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031
And the Mandarin speakers voice will be coming out of Jennifer Aniston

399
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Mouth as if she had said

400
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
And in front of the camera

401
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,711
Her lips would be moving as if she were perfect Mandarin speaker

402
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Exactly

403
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Wow

404
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,087
I think I've heard of it is actually a vegetable

405
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Yeah

406
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Oh my God

407
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
I'm Amazed

408
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Completely frightened

409
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
By what you're telling me

410
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,583
NFL point of what Nick was writing about that they gave me shivers

411
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
That someday if you join the video manipulation with the vocal voice manipulation

412
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
You're the ultimate puppeteer

413
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
You can create

414
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
Anyone talking about anything that you want

415
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
In their own voice

416
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
And having any kind of emotion around it

417
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
And you have it right there for everyone to see

418
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
In video

419
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
And all you need to do

420
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Is take that

421
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Put it on Twitter or Facebook

422
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
And if it's shocking enough

423
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Minutes later it everywhere

424
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,359
Like the timing of you guys making this thing and then this explosion of fake news

425
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
Like how do you guys think about about how it could be used for

426
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Nefarious purpose

427
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Oh yeah it's a good question

428
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,415
You're coming back or Slytherin

429
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,511
I feel like when everything college has developed under there is danger of

430
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,863
Vdara technology you can create fake videos and song

431
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,447
Are there any college fake videos like to create video from audio rights

432
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
But they are fake videos

433
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
But the way that I think about it is that

434
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
Like scientists are doing their job in science like

435
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
Invented the technology and science

436
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
It's off and then we all need to

437
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Let's think about the next steps

438
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
I mean that

439
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,719
And the answer is not clear maybe syndication maybe it's every video should come up with some code now

440
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
That's this is

441
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,607
This is like authentic vdrf antique attacks since you don't believe anything else

442
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Yeah like it maybe was the timing more than anything but I saw this video and it really felt like

443
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
Oh my God like America can't

444
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Handle this right now

445
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,455
Like we're in a moment where we're truth seems to be sort of

446
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,295
An Open disc what is true is Pez become an open discussion

447
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,903
And this seems to be adding fuel on the fire of sort of

448
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
Competing narratives in a way that I

449
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
I find trouble

450
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
And I'm just curious that you don't

451
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
I think that

452
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
I think that's people

453
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
If people know the types of knowledge exist

454
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Then they will be more skeptical

455
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
My guess

456
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
I don't know

457
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
But if people know that taking is exceeded

458
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Everything all that shake that

459
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Texas

460
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Fake videos exist fake photos

461
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
Then everyone is more skeptical in what

462
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
They read

463
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
But like a man in North Carolina I think it's from North Carolina believed from a fake print article that

464
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Hillary Clinton was running a sex ring out of a pizza

465
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Parlor in DC which is like

466
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
This man believed didn't shut up with a gun

467
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
If people are at a moment where they are willing to believe

468
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Stories is Ludacris's that

469
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Like I

470
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
Don't expect them to wonder if this video is real or not

471
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
The weather you ask

472
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,280
And ask it what I'm asking do you are you afraid of the power of this and

473
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
If not

474
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Why

475
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,032
I'm just give you my answer your questions but I'm a scientist

476
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,432
Not really because I know how I know that because I know that these Technologies reversible

477
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
I mean nobody

478
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Well

479
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
There's not

480
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Nuts

481
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
What

482
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Too much

483
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,984
Have you seen the videos otherwise I can tap you okay

484
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,384
And if we're feeling worried and more than that surprised that the folks making these Technologies weren't

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
We decided to do 30 gut check to see if we were totally off basin

486
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Get in touch with one of the guys who's on

487
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
The front lines

488
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,648
Can you describe what was going through your head when you were watching Bush's face

489
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
I can tell you exactly what I was thinking I was thinking

490
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
How are we going to develop a friend to techniques

491
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Detect this

492
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
This is honey for read I am a professor of

493
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,496
Computer science at Dartmouth College he started like a Sherlock Holmes

494
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,896
Ace of digital misdeeds which means they spent a lot of time sitting around looking at pictures and videos trying to understand

495
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
Where has this come from has been manipulated and should be

496
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
We trusted season work for all sorts of organizations

497
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,624
Beatty the times Reuters want to know if they a picture is fake or

498
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
They often will ask me you have to leave when

499
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
Like this just happened that yesterday images came out of North Korea

500
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
And everytime you just come out of these regimes or there's a history of photomanipulation there are real concerns about this so

501
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:40,032
So I was asked to determine if they've been manipulated in some way and if so how had they been manipulated

502
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
And what how did how the heck would you do that well

503
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
Everytime you manipulate data you're going to leave something behind

504
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Let's say you do some funny business to a photo

505
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
You might create some noticeable Distortion in the picture

506
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,928
Self but you also might distort the date and we're in the business of basically

507
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Finding those distortions in the data

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
For example imagine you get sent a photo

509
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
Probably a JPEG jpeg which now is

510
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
99% of the image formats that we see out there

511
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
Is what is called a lossy compression scheme

512
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Just a fancy way to say that

513
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
When a photo is taken and stored as a jpeg

514
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
The camera you know just to save space

515
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Throws a little bit of the date away

516
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,552
So for example if I went out to the Dartmouth green right now to the picture of the grass

517
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:30,720
The camera isn't going to store all those millions of little variations of green hidden in the grass because that would be

518
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Huge files

519
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
It's going to save space by throwing some of those greens away

520
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
You just don't notice if it changes

521
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
Like a lot or a little bit less than that is grass as far as

522
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
You can talk nice trick every camera has a subtly different pallet of greens that's going to keep and greens at store

523
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Throw away this

524
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
Very tremendously from device to device on iPhone compresses the image much more setlist greens and a high

525
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,392
High-end icon or ion cannon which would keep more of those variations

526
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,512
Now if you hold these two pictures side-by-side you might not be able to tell the difference

527
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,096
But honey says when you look at the underlying pixel

528
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,168
There are different recognizable patterns

529
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
You take an image off of your iPhone

530
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
I should be able to go into that JPEG and look at the packaging and say I got this

531
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Should have come out of an iPhone

532
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,968
But if that images upload to Facebook and then re-download it or put into Photoshop and re-save

533
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,368
It will not look like a tiger consistent with an iPhone so basically he can see at the level of the pixels or data whether the picture

534
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
And this is of course just one of many different ways that honey can Spotify

535
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
Yeah let me ask Mike if you could go up against

536
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
The top 100

537
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
Best counterfeiters

538
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
Do you think you'd catch them

539
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
10% of the time 50% of the time that have cats what's your sense

540
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,432
I would say we could probably catch 75% of the face

541
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,272
But I would say that would take a long time to do this is not an easy task

542
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
And so yeah

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
A sandwich

544
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
The medium moves

545
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
Does not lend itself to

546
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
Careful forensic analysis of images

547
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
I'm always amazed that

548
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
Nicodemos you like. You got 20 minutes

549
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
And I'm you would need

550
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,960
You'll have to day today per image to a very manual on the very human process

551
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
It's so

552
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
Is this video editing

553
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:25,920
And this audio editing this coming down the pipeline here I guess it should I be

554
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Should I be terrified

555
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Yes you should know

556
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
Did you really you really mean that

557
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
Yeah I think it's I think it's going to raise the fake news thing to a whole new level

558
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
I did see some artifacts by the way in the videos they are not perfect but that's neither here nor there because the ability

559
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,216
We have technology to manipulate and alter reality is growing at a Breakneck

560
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,800
And the ability to disseminate that information is

561
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Phenomenal

562
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
I can't stop that by the

563
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Because at the end of the day it's always going to

564
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
Easier to create a fake lie detector fake

565
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Thank you very much

566
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Dad

567
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,352
Himself just handed me a cup of water which shows none of you have gotten too big for your britches and that could be a

568
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Serious problem

569
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
I would like to have seen Peter Jennings do that

570
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Ever

571
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,056
For this guy my name is John Klein co-founder and CEO of tap media

572
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Before that president of CNN us

573
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:33,248
Before that I was Executive Vice President of CBS News where I was executive in charge of

574
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
60 Minutes 48 hours

575
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
A bunch of others

576
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,928
And he's had to react to some serious Evolutions in the media industry

577
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
He was Manning the helm is social media exploded as

578
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Smartphones become ubiquitous

579
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
Consequently he had to deal with figuring out

580
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,008
How and if to trust thousands of hours of video taken on these smartphones and sended by viewers

581
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
What's a broadcast in

582
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Why not

583
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,896
And so we wanted to know how someone in his position would

584
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Think about the

585
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Deepfake videos

586
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Soapweed

587
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
Set of all the different demos and videos we come across just

588
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
To see what he thought

589
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
First thought was that this is the kind of thing that

590
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
A James Bond villain

591
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Would put to use or

592
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
The Joker

593
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
In Batman

594
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
Ernie's great girl

595
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
Right wants to be most popular

596
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
You know I mean this is

597
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
There's so many ways to abuse

598
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Blow your mind

599
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
I mean

600
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
It

601
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
It goes

602
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
To the

603
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Very

604
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Score of

605
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Communication

606
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
What weather television

607
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Radio

608
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Interpersonal

609
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,000
It is what I'm seeing true is what I'm hearing real

610
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Over the course of your career you've seen multiple technological development state of impacted

611
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
Intermediates in rather profound ways

612
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
Where is your Terror level right now or your fear level

613
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
Caused by this relative to all of the other

614
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Sort of advance

615
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Instead of occurred over

616
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
It's terrifying

617
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
It is

618
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,624
Hurdles us even faster toward that point where No One Believes anything

619
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,304
How do you have a democracy in a country where people can't trust

620
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Anything that they Siri

621
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Anymore

622
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
What

623
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
What we saw happen with

624
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
Fake news during the election cycle was that

625
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,336
I'm only the lead to matter if anyone

626
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Pino

627
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Wood

628
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:41,504
Rebuff it afterwards this is Nick Bilton again it would reach millions and millions of people

629
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
Mere seconds

630
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
And

631
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
And that was it

632
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
You don't need a dentist it's job and I think that

633
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
With this audio stuff

634
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
And the video stuff that's going to

635
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
That's going to come down

636
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,120
Online in the next few years it's going to do the same thing but

637
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
But no one's going to know what's real and what's not

638
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
It says if you think about

639
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
The video that came out Donald Trump from Access Hollywood

640
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,808
The thing that was really interesting about that video

641
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
You can do anything

642
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,744
Grandmother you don't actually see Donald Trump until the very last second when he gets off the bus

643
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,840
How are you I only hear him

644
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:32,960
And so if that technology existed today I can guarantee you

645
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
That Donald Trump would have responded

646
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
By saying it's fake

647
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,128
Take nudes fake audio you can't see me I didn't say that

648
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
And it would just be

649
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,456
This video is word against his

650
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:51,392
Galaxy that's kind of like for me that's sir the real problem here like you create this this possibility for like

651
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Plausible deniability

652
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
So broad like

653
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
Tobacco industry in the sixties and seventies

654
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
I was just reading this great article by other

655
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
And the writer Tim Harford about the

656
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
In sixties and seventies a tobacco industry LED this very

657
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Calculator

658
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Did effort

659
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Disorder push back against

660
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,200
Cancer signs by

661
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
I know a little bit of doubt

662
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
Year little bit of doubt

663
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,184
On the other hand on the other hand isn't that just enough wiggle room

664
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
But nothing happened

665
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
I do that with climate change to

666
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
And it's that little bit of doubt that creates

667
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Paralysis

668
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,704
And is that what's going to happen that like there's going to be paralysis now

669
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
Writ large because now we're talkin about

670
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
The very things we see

671
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
The very things we hear

672
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,224
But wait but we don't you think that before we get completely carried away with the threat of History

673
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
LGB

674
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Maybe we should just find out

675
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Literally where we are now

676
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Yeah we should give it a spin

677
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
Sentence with this moment do you think making one of these eclipses is is possible

678
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
I think it's entirely possible

679
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
I just decided I would be careful what it is

680
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
After the break

681
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Things get

682
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
Fake

683
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:36,608
How did everyone it's Angela calling from Dallas Texas to Radiolab is supported in park

684
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Buy the outfit

688
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
ORD thanks Radiolab

689
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,088
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

690
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
And I'm here because I need your help

691
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
And I request

692
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

693
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
About what we're calling tiny moments

694
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Brilliance

695
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Basically I want to hear about this

696
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
Times when a kid you know did something

697
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,640
It just means you lean back and say whoa

698
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
How did they do that

699
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Maybe it was the moment that I

700
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

701
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Do you

702
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,600
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

703
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,952
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

704
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,816
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

705
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't

706
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Have anything to do with the test

707
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
If you have a story

708
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312

Thank you so much

714
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
Jad Robert Radiolab. We're back we're going to now

715
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
Fake something

716
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
We're going to build our own video from scratch

717
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
Fake words fake faces cuz we want to know

718
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Back in use

719
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
How dangerous are these

720
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Technologies

721
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
Really

722
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Can they make a convincing fake are they as

723
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Easy as advertised

724
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,832
So we will find out by giving the assignment as well

725
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Long suffering

726
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
So well I was in Seattle talking to drink leaves

727
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,840
Not so subtly hinted that I would really like to

728
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,448
To give vocolo world let's say I had my hands on it somehow when can I do it

729
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,056
Well right now nothing because we haven't shared it with

730
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:59,456
At first I just thought he didn't want me to be able to play around with it but then I realize that and I don't even have a personal

731
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Copy for myself yet

732
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
I said not even on the premises

733
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,880
No it's it's still very much contained to research

734
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Oh

735
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
But

736
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:16,608
Hiya hiya hey man great eventually I got in touch with this

737
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,168
Matthew eyelets on the Chiefs

738
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,032
Science officer airport Limited

739
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,336
Yeah okay so

740
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
Called you up because I was hoping

741
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
That you could help me to make

742
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,480
A video clip that has I don't know

743
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
Bush or Barack Obama

744
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Saying things that

745
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
They have never

746
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Yep this is right

747
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
That's it

748
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,792
Uses game the thing is what his company does is not

749
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Quite the same as vocal

750
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
They do is like for a client node

751
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
Create a voice that you can then just type in Word

752
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,264
They're sentences and make that voice say whatever you want

753
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
I feel sad that's an interesting idea accents

754
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
Variety of languages

755
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Internet spare time when they're not making voice

756
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
For clients

757
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
Discover Donald Trump nigga I think they're building celebrities

758
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
And it just so happens

759
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
It got to Barack Obama and George Bush

760
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,400
Yeah how did you create a George Bush robot

761
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Well a great thing about

762
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
George Bush says he was president United States

763
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
Sometimes morning

764
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Good morning which means

765
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
She had to give

766
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,432
The weekly presidential address

767
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
The other great thing about me dresses he's completely copyright

768
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Free summer Alliance

769
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
To do anything we like that video

770
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
For the people of America

771
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,160
Maybe things that they have envisaged that we got to do with it

772
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
Real quick digression here just because it's absolutely fascinating

773
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,120
It looks like we're actually about to enter this really sticky gray area when it comes to voice

774
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
If you record an audiobook

775
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
And you sign over the rights

776
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
To those audio files to the publisher

777
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
The publisher has a copyright

778
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
You you don't own it you do not own your own voice

779
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Is that really true

780
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Anyway

781
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
Back to Bush

782
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
Lowe's weekly addresses

783
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
About 6 hours

784
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,648
Which is a lot more tape invoke has 20 minutes but what you did with it is

785
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Pretty similar

786
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,512
Right fed them into this machine learning algorithms along with their transcripts

787
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
And then with the program will do I type the text and it will analyzing Sons it linger

788
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,496
Twistix I will say this is the word Social Security social

789
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
What's OSHA's made out of

790
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
The sounds

791
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Oh

792
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
And so

793
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Bootcut low sounds app

794
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,552
Lots of little tiny pieces did that for all of the words

795
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,672
All of these addresses River Run 80000 in total

796
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
Put them all in this database with tons of info about What song came before it after cetera and

797
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
Once that database is built up all that's left to do I type in some text and then I put go with it trying to find

798
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,592
Set of little sounds which will join together really nicely

799
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,176
And then I push play and see how well they came out

800
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:17,600
So what we did was we found an old video of former President George Bush and Barack Obama today

801
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,952
Free shaking hands making generic statements

802
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Exactly is an import

803
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,024
But we wondered

804
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
Could we turn that clip

805
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
From a boring meet and greet

806
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,192
To a scenario where bush is telling Obama a joke

807
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,800
So we convinced a comedy writer Rachel axler who works for the show Veep

808
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
Let's write a few jokes

809
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Optomap in

810
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,408
This is what the computers bad

811
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
And well

812
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
It goes something like

813
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Knock knock who's there

814
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,392
I think it's something about the Oval Office probably

815
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
That wasn't a very good joke

816
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
The president

817
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
My wife Laura tells her better

818
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,936
Wait what was that was terrible

819
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,336
I told Nikki that was like where that I don't even get a I don't understand that joke at all

820
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
That's literally with the computer spot out

821
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
That is what computer set out in

822
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,832
Trippy. I don't think it anywhere it it did it is not worthy of the negative response that you are getting an error

823
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Let Live let me show you another one

824
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,952
So happy to be joining forces with this good man

825
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
But God is all in your drinking water

826
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Cortisol

827
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Cortisol to help protect

828
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
People cheat so they don't get fillings

829
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Isn't that alright

830
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
OSHA

831
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
I think I signed the wrong bill

832
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
This is what you do chords

833
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
The robots is massacred that is in itself

834
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:53,088
But I do think it yet I'll let me get it while you two are far more critical than you should be and you are far more critical than the average Lyft

835
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
However

836
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,720
Matt

837
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Conversation

838
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Getting people to set the

839
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,376
To talk back and forth to each other are still really difficult for it

840
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,448
Synthesizer

841
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,312
I need a long time before we get really really easy conversation

842
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Human quality

843
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,480
A tour to a conversation that that the synthesizers

844
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
Can't quite capture

845
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
But he also told us that

846
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,136
You know if we at once we add the video or if we add a video to this

847
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
It will smooth out a lot of

848
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
A lot of the prop

849
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,816
When you have to say she's as well speaking people not focusing me audio

850
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
Coneheads of the iris in the same way

851
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,192
So

852
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,800
Great great

853
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
Two grad students

854
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,224
My name is James get title from the University of Southern California USC

855
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Also do a lot of facial reenactment

856
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Surgeon agreed to help

857
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
But

858
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,928
Making these visuals also turned out to be way harder than we thought

859
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,328
Turn off the clip we chose post some serious challenges there were too many side shots of Obama's

860
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
Space at the lighting was all wrong

861
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,728
And eventually I got an e-mail one late Sunday night saying

862
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
It's not going to work

863
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Okay

864
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,080
So now I think I can draw a line here

865
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
And I can point out that this

866
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
That we may be got over excited about this technology

867
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
It is not yet ready for True deceit you have been fumbling and fumbling and fumbling here

868
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
I have with them if they are you not the rug as people I find it interesting psychologically the timer

869
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,584
I feel like it's a personal failure I don't like to fail

870
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
You should

871
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:48,032
So okay just just descansamos behalf on the behalf of extra trying to answer the question we fell

872
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Okay maybe

873
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Maybe

874
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:55,967
We should try this one last time let's find a simpler Obama video and with the audio rather than

875
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
Michael phrases let's just do a couple word Replacements here or there

876
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
By the way the only reason we're using Obama's annies

877
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
All these Technologies

878
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Is your belt around

879
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Play Sweet shows the video of Obama's last weekly address and which was the audio from a talk he'd given a

880
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
Chicago

881
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
After he left office

882
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
What's what's

883
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:22,591
Nsvt Surah talks about what he's going to do next how he's still going to keep fighting for what he believes is right

884
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Build with

885
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Idealism

886
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
An absolutely certain that somehow I was going to

887
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
The world

888
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
But what if he didn't

889
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,671
What if you could at that moment see the divisions ahead and he was just like

890
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
That's too much I guess

891
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
The truth is we didn't think too hard about this

892
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
We didn't have much time we just whipped

893
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
Together script based on words

894
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Used

895
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
You change it send it off to the guys at USC

896
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,543
Vienna videotape myself saying this new script said that

897
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
Use that video my face

898
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
The puppet eyes at

899
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
President

900
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
And at when when we got the final video back

901
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
I have to say it was

902
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,463
I was expecting it to be horrible and we're to have a good laugh but

903
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
I

904
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
It went from like Laffy Taffy to

905
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Oh

906
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Wait this is

907
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,447
Creepy I was suddenly

908
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,751
I had been gangbusters we got to release

909
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
This thing is

910
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,335
And not tell anybody and try to fake out the entire world

911
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
But when when I saw that there was

912
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
A real active

913
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,015
You mean your own oh I know God yeah yeah I thought I would

914
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,367
This my personal thought was like it was convincing enough that I got genuinely spoon

915
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,975
But you know just baroness we shouldn't sit around talking about something people can't see

916
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Go to Future of fake news.com and check it out for yourself it's all one word future of fake

917
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167

You can see how Simon made the video

920
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Check it out

921
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
The whole process

922
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Got us all thinking like

923
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,503
Like oh wow what if we bunch of idiots can do this

924
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
For no money

925
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Very quickly

926
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
What will this mean

927
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
Feel like a newsroom

928
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
To start there

929
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
We're at the level now with with this kind of thing

930
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
Where we need

931
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Technologist

932
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Tutu verify

933
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Ward knocked down

934
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
News executive John Kline

935
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
I don't think journalists

936
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
English Majors

937
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
Are are are going to be the watts to to solve it

938
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,199
Can I eat you may have been editor of your school paper but

939
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
This is beyond your

940
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Your capability but

941
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
If you're good at collaborating with

942
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
Engineers in

943
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Scientists

944
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,975
I hope you have a good chance of working together

945
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
To you to figure it out

946
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
So we need we need

947
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Technical X

948
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Petitis

949
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
More than we ever have

950
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,751
Can I ask you in your hearts is it let me compare your heart to my heart

951
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
In my heart

952
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
I want somebody

953
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Tell the researchers

954
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
Yes are you can't do that

955
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:11,295
Sorry but you know I I know it's really cool I know you I know you probably are really proud of that algorithm but

956
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,159
Men In Black are going to walk in right now they're going to take your computers away

957
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,279
And and you give you the Cancer Society is going to overrule you right now

958
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Did you eat

959
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
Is there a party that

960
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
Just dictatorially want to just like squash this

961
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Wilshire

962
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
But when he still have the

963
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,799
What are the FSB in Moscow or the CIA

964
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Utilizing this

965
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
And developing it anyway

966
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Weaponizing it

967
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
So to speak

968
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Probably

969
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
I think that the

970
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
The top

971
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
Down model

972
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
Could never contain

973
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
John says ultimately what's happening is probably going to be bigger than any one organization or any

974
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
A1 Newsroom consult

975
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,887
Said it'll probably end up coming down to the 14 and 15 year olds

976
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Weather tomorrow

977
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,055
Who will grab using this technology making fake videos being the victims of fake videos

978
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
And maybe

979
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,711
In the Maze of them having two parts truth from fiction in such a personal way

980
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
Some kind of code will do

981
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
I'm an optimist by Nature

982
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,647
I do I look at this and I said well somebody's going to figure it out

983
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
What worries me is

984
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
The larger context within the state

985
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Within which this takes place

986
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
This is all occurring within the context of

987
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,655
Massive music literacy

988
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,703
And the the

989
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
Consumers

990
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Seem to be

991
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Is throwing their hands up

992
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Tiring of China even figure it out

993
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
And so just the

994
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
The work involved

995
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
In getting to the bottom

996
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
Of the truth

997
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Is

998
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
Unappealing to a growing

999
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
Percentage of the audience

1000
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
And

1001
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
I'm not sure

1002
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
We're genze the teenagers of today

1003
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
Come out on this

1004
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,863
Let's hope that they are more willing

1005
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
To do the

1006
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Maybe out of selfie

1007
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
Pinterest maybe so that they're not dissed

1008
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Bye

1009
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
Yeah the girl in social studies

1010
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
But that's our best hope

1011
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
For overcoming

1012
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
Is everybody else

1013
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
